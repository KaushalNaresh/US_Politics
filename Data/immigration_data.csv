ATLANTA, GA — Additional Georgia National Guard troops are being deployed to the nation's southern border in Texas to help hinder ""the free flow of illegal migrants"" into the U.S., Gov. Brian Kemp announced Tuesday.

It is unknown how many guardsmen will be deployed, but Kemp's office said the expected timeline for deployment is in the spring. The troops will be skilled in engineering, mechanical and general purpose skills. ""While deployed, they will assist in the construction of a forward command post on the Texas border with Mexico. Georgia Guard leadership will work closely with Texas Guard leadership in the coming weeks to tailor the mission in accordance with Texas' official request for assistance and the evolving conditions on the border,"" Kemp's office said.

The deployment, which will be known as Operation Lone Star, comes after Kemp traveled to the border in early February. He called the situation at the border ""a crisis."" Georgia guardsmen have spent the longest period of time at the border compared to any other state, Kemp's office said. He first deployed the troops in 2019 to the border.

The state is also now part of the American Governors' Border Strike Task Force. The effort partners together multiple states to disassemble ""criminal organizations by increasing communication, improving intelligence, investing in analysis, combating human smuggling and stopping the flow of drugs into states,"" Kemp's office said. Suggesting he is keeping the safety of Americans in mind, Kemp said Georgia fully supports Texas in its attempt to secure the southern border and will offer more resources to Texas, if necessary.

Kemp's office claims at least 8.5 million illegal immigrants have come into the U.S. in recent years. Texas guardsmen have seized more than 56,000 pounds of meth, at least 458 million doses of fentanyl and more than $51 million in currency, his office said.

It is unknown how long the Georgia troops will be deployed."
Feb 18 2024,Debate over Law SB4: Attempts to Suspend Immigration Law in Texas,Alaska Commons,center,https://alaskacommons.com/debate-over-law-sb4-attempts-to-suspend-immigration-law-in-texas/129923,"The federal government was in a court in Austin, Texas, seeking to suspend the application of the SB 4 law, which gives the state power to arrest undocumented immigrants and Texas judges to issue expulsion orders. This is despite the fact that immigration has belonged to the federal government and not to each state. The federal government filed a motion to obtain a permanent suspension order, with the hearing taking place on February 15 with Judge David A. Ezra. The judge commented that he will make a decision on SB 4 before it goes into effect on March 5, 2024.

The United States Congress aimed for the federal government to control the entry and expulsion of non-citizens, they argued in their petition to suspend SB 4. “Immigration, foreign relations and the control of an international border” are federal interests, and SB 4 would be directly interfering in them. The law gives Texas the power to control immigration, similar to what Arizona wanted to do more than a decade ago. However, the Supreme Court of Justice in 2012 ruled in favor of the federal government, arguing that this immigration power does not belong to each state.

The United States argues that Texas’s SB 4 law creates a conflict between the country and the relations it has with Mexico. For example, SB 4 gives permission to state judges to expel immigrants to Mexico, without considering whether this country would accept them. The federal government maintains that SB 4 goes against the constitution because the application of these immigration laws corresponds to the federation. According to United States precedents, it is against the interests of citizens to be applying laws that go against the constitution.

The federal government’s petition argues that SB 4 violates the Foreign Trade Clause that the United States has. Within the country’s Trade Clause, the “movement of people” is contemplated, which includes undocumented immigrants who are workers and cross into the United States, affecting interstate commerce. The law discriminates against foreign trade on its face: it only penalizes the movement of non-citizens across an international border into Texas, even imposing expulsion as a penalty.

Under SB 4, immigrants cannot be arrested in public places such as schools, hospitals, or churches. However, if you are taking another person for medical treatment, they could face consequences if the police want to stop them. SB 4 does not contemplate universities, which could also represent risks for those who are studying. The Texas law is the strongest nationally against immigrants, as it allows officers to arrest those they suspect are undocumented. However, groups opposed to SB 4 say that this opens the door to racial discrimination, because any suspicion of being an immigrant could lead to the arrest of immigrants.

SB 4 does not say where in Texas it will be applying. Some politicians have mentioned that it could only apply near the border, but the law is not clear and does not say where it would be carried out. SB 4 collides with federal law, which contemplates that there people who request their right to seek asylum in the United States. SB 4 does not contemplate it, so the highest courts will have to come in to make a decision. “Any person is subject to abuse and arrests,” says a lawyer. “That they deprive you of your freedom, of your rights, which are guaranteed to you by the Constitution of the United States, simply because someone thinks that you are illegal here.”

Feb 03 2024,They protest at the southern border of the US against immigration,California 18,center,https://california18.com/they-protest-at-the-southern-border-of-the-us-against-immigration/12013372024,"EAGLE PASS — In trucks, vans and mobile homes, hundreds of people began to arrive at the southern tip of the United States to demonstrate this Saturday against the immigration “invasion” that they say is affecting the country and to “recover” the border.

The caravan of vehicles arrived at a ranch in Quemado, a Texas town of 162 inhabitants, with rustic houses scattered in the middle of the valley through which the Rio Grande or Rio Grande runs, the natural border between the United States and Mexico.

Thousands of migrants cross that river every month, undertaking long journeys from Central and South America fleeing poverty and in search of better living conditions in the United States, a key issue in the debate of the November presidential elections.

And it is on the banks of that river where the activists who call themselves “We the People” decided to meet (“We the People”, as the preamble to the US Constitution begins).

Days before, one of the organizers of the event stated that the participants were “God’s Army.”

Under the motto “Take our border back,” these activists began convoys this past week from different parts of the country to towns on the southern border to camp there this weekend.

“The migration at the border is out of control. We are being invaded and, we need to control what is happening,” said Robyn Forzano, 43, who controls access to the ranch in Texas.

Vans arrive with flags of support for former president Donald Trump, Republican favorite for the November presidential elections, and with slogans rejecting the Democratic ruler Joe Biden, who will try for a new term.

“Heaven has walls, hell has open borders,” reads one activist’s sign.

“disaster zone”

“When you go to Mexico, there are fantastic people, but it seems that when they cross over to this side, … they commit robberies,” says Marty Bird, 73, in Eagle Pass.

This city about 30 kilometers from Quemado is the epicenter of a conflict between Texas Governor Greg Abbott and the Biden administration.

The federal government is suing Abbott for taking military control of Shelby Park, which has an access ramp to the river, and for laying barbed wire on the riverbank.

In mid-January, the Biden government reported that Texan soldiers prevented border police, under federal jurisdiction, from accessing the park to rescue three migrants who drowned. Texas rejected the accusation.

Biden took the case all the way to the Supreme Court, which authorized border police to cut the barbed wire fence. But the governor has opposed and has put up more fences.

With a kayak rental business on that river, Jessie Fuentes is directly affected by the situation: “That river today is a disaster zone (…) The park is becoming a military base.”

Alejandro Mayrkas, federal secretary of Homeland Security, said Friday that the governor’s actions were “inadmissible.” The official faces impeachment in Congress, accused of promoting the immigration crisis with his policies.

Eagle Pass, which has about 30,000 residents, has become a major corridor for illegal crossings in recent years, prompting Abbott to focus his attention there. The community is located in the Border Patrol sector of Del Rio, Texas, which is typically the busiest of the agency’s nine divisions on the border.

No migrants were seen in the grassy fields of Shelby Park on Friday as Texas National Guard troops unwound razor wire over containers that dot the riverbank. According to the mayor, about 200 people arrived the day before, a figure much lower than those registered in December.

At a ranch outside Eagle Pass where Abbott supporters gathered before Saturday’s rally, vendors sold hats and flags inspired by Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. A homemade sign read: “The federal government has lost its way. Their job is to protect the states.”

Feb 29 2024,"In clash over immigration, Biden and Trump both bound for the U.S.-Mexico border today  – Pennsylvania Capital-Star",Pennsylvania Capital-Star,right,https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/in-clash-over-immigration-biden-and-trump-both-bound-for-the-u-s-mexico-border-today,"Surrogates for President Joe Biden dismissed former President Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday as a political stunt, adding that the likely Republican presidential nominee was exploiting an issue that he has shown no desire to fix.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia of California, both Democrats, told reporters on a Wednesday conference call organized by the Biden reelection campaign that Trump’s record — recently and throughout his public life — showed he was anything but serious about addressing the myriad issues resulting from a recent surge in migration across the southern border.

Trump is scheduled to visit the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday to call attention to Biden’s record on border security.

Biden separately will pay a visit to Brownsville, about 300 miles southeast of Eagle Pass.

Trump has no credibility on immigration after tanking a bipartisan agreement to strengthen border enforcement, Pritzker and Garcia said Wednesday. Trump reportedly asked Republicans in Congress not to support the deal to avoid handing Biden a victory in an election year, they noted.

“Republicans frankly just do not care about solving the challenges facing this country,” Pritzker said. “They only care about saving their own skin. This could have been a press call touting a bipartisan path forward. Instead, Donald Trump wanted a campaign slogan.”

In a campaign statement Wednesday, Trump commended his own record on immigration, noting he signed executive orders calling for a wall on the southern border, declaring a national emergency on the border and sending police and military resources to the region.

Trump “created the most secure border in history,” the statement said, and would reinstate several policies that Biden dropped.

Trump would end a policy that allows migrants to live freely in a U.S. community as they await immigration hearings, cease birthright citizenship for the children of migrants in the country without legal authorization — even though an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is interpreted to guarantee that right — and use the military to combat drug cartels, the statement said.

Trump said in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Saturday that he would seek to enact the “largest deportation in the history of our country” if elected.

“The first and most urgent action when we win will be the sealing of the border, stopping the invasion, drill baby drill, send Joe Biden’s illegal aliens back home,” Trump said. “We’ll do all of those things and we’re gonna have to do them fast because no country can sustain what’s happening in our country.”

Garcia, who immigrated to the country as a child, said Trump’s history of racist rhetoric showed he had misplaced priorities on immigration policy.

Trump has used what critics say are racist generalizations of immigrants since his entrance into national politics, a 2015 speech announcing his first White House run in which he made derogatory comments about immigrants from Mexico.

Trump believes “preying on immigrants is his path to reelection,” Garcia said.

“This is a cruel man with a cruel agenda,” he said.

Trump’s “extremism” on immigration would go even further than in his first term, Garcia said.

The former president has talked about returning to the family separation policy at the border, which attracted major controversy in his first term, has expressed support for ending birthright citizenship and said he would act as a dictator for the first day of a potential second term to enact extreme border policies, Garcia said.

Trump and other Republicans have harshly criticized the Biden administration’s approach to immigration, with House Republicans impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this month over his supposed failure to enforce immigration laws.

Garcia called Trump’s approach to the issue “fearmongering.”

“Donald Trump doesn’t give a damn about border security,” he said. “All he cares about is stirring up pain, stirring up division.”"
Feb 19 2024,Interfaith leaders denounce anti-immigration rhetoric after neo-Nazi march in Nashville,The Tennessean,center,https://tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/19/nashville-nazi-march-interfaith-leaders-slam-anti-immigrant-rhetoric/72658293007,"A group of interfaith leaders and Nashville politicians denounced a white supremacist march held downtown on Saturday while decrying anti-immigration rhetoric they say has emboldened dangerous racist views.

More than two dozen marchers, the majority of whom hid their faces with full masks, unfurled swastika flags amid Nazi salutes and repeated chants of ""Save the white man"" and ""Deport every Mexican.""

Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, and his chief of staff, Chandler Quaile, were leaving a downtown event Saturday honoring an historic Black sorority when they heard the group yelling. Quaile, who has Jewish and Mexican grandparents, recorded the group as it marched down the street.

""I began to cry because these are the types of people and ideologies that wiped out my ancestors, that reminded my grandparents every day that this country would never be their country, that they didn't belong, that they had no place here,"" Quaile said at a Monday news conference outside the Capitol. ""It's the type of ideology that made them hide being Jewish and hide being Mexican, because it was too scary to confront the reality that in America, a hate crime is always one moment away.""

The march sparked widespread, bipartisan condemnation over the weekend for its anti-Semitic imagery. Alongside immigrant advocate groups and faith leaders, Metro Nashville Council member Zulfat Suara and Jones said Monday recent Republican rhetoric likening immigration border issues to an ""invasion"" emboldened white supremacists.

""What we witnessed was the direct result of politicians spreading misinformation and hate messages about immigrants,"" said Tessa Lemos Del Pino, executive director of Tennessee Justice for Our Neighbors.

The marchers' red shirts included the words ""Blood Tribe."" The white supremacist hate group displays Nazi imagery and holds virulent anti-Semitic views. It also often focuses on ""hypermasculinity,"" according to the Anti-Defamation League, and has targeted LGBTQ groups in previous public demonstrations, referring to LGBTQ groups as ""pedophiles.""

On Monday, a number of Republican leaders in Tennessee were among a bipartisan group that continued to denounce the marchers and what they stood for, including House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, and Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge.

""Our nation spent significant blood and treasure during WWII to rid the world of the wicked and murderous ideology of Nazism,"" McNally said on social media. ""To see this hate resurface on the streets of our state Capitol was horrific. Those thugs do not represent TN values and they are not welcome here — ever."""
Feb 21 2024,Texas AG Ken Paxton Sues El Paso Nonprofit For Alleged ‘Efforts to Facilitate Illegal Immigration’,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/texas-ag-ken-paxton-sues-el-paso-nonprofit-for-alleged-efforts-to-facilitate-illegal-immigration-5591915,"The attorney general filed the lawsuit after the Catholic organization ’refused' to release documentation about the clients it serves.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit to shut down operations of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) in El Paso that provides housing and other services for illegal immigrants.

Earlier this month, the Consumer Protection Division of the attorney general’s office opened an investigation into the Annunciation House, a Catholic nonprofit in El Paso, after reviewing public records that indicated possible legal violations, including “facilitating illegal entry to the United States, alien harboring, human smuggling, and operating a stash house,” according to the lawsuit

“The chaos at the southern border has created an environment where NGOs, funded with taxpayer money from the Biden Administration, facilitate astonishing horrors, including human smuggling,” Mr. Paxton said in a Feb. 20 statement . “While the federal government perpetuates the lawlessness destroying this country, my office works day in and day out to hold these organizations responsible.”

On Feb. 7, the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) requested documentation from Annunciation House to examine its operations and the clients it serves. It was allowed one day to turn over the requested documentation.

The attorney general’s “demand for ‘immediate access’ was not made in a vacuum,” the court document reads.

“Rather, OAG agents were monitoring Annunciation House during the period leading up to the Request to Examine.

“Those observations showed that Annunciation House operates in an unusually covert way, raising concerns about how truthful it would be in a document production.”

Annunciation House declined The Epoch Times’ request for comment on the lawsuit.

The NGO asked the state for a 30-day extension to turn over documents, which the state denied. The organization then filed a lawsuit against the attorney general, requesting a temporary restraining order to delay the attorney general’s request.

“Annunciation House asked a Court to decide what documents the law permits the Attorney General to access,” the nonprofit wrote in a Feb. 21 statement on its website. “There is nothing illegal about asking a Court to decide a person’s rights.”

Annunciation House also stated that it has “provided hospitality to hundreds of thousands of refugees” since it began its operations in the 1970s. Failure to Comply Under Texas law, organizations failing to comply with an investigative request by the attorney general’s office forfeit the right to do business in the state, according to the lawsuit.

Therefore, the OAG has asked the court for “permanent injunctive relief prohibiting Annunciation House from transacting any business in Texas.”

“The AG has now made explicit that its real goal is not records but to shut down the organization,” Annunciation House said in the statement. “It has stated that it considers it a crime for a catholic organization to provide shelter to refugees.”

The organization went on to say that its work is “recognized by the Catholic Church” and that Mr. Paxton’s “position to shut down Annunciation House is unfounded.”

“Annunciation House’s response to the stranger is no different from that of the schools who enroll children of refugees, the clinics and the hospitals who care for the needs of refugees, and the churches, synagogues and mosques who welcome families to join in worship,” the statement reads.

The organization also stated that it has kept “hundreds of thousands of refugees” passing through El Paso “off the streets.”

“If the work that Annunciation House conducts is illegal—so too is the work of our local hospitals, schools, and food banks,” it stated.

The organization stated that it would offer more information during a press conference scheduled for 11 a.m. MST on Feb. 23."

(WIBW) - The Kansas House passed a resolution supporting Texas in combatting illegal immigration.

On Wednesday, Feb. 7, on Final Action, officials with the State of Kansas House of Representatives said the Kansas house overwhelmingly passed a Resolution affirming state sovereignty, supporting Texas to combat illegal immigration and encouraging Governor Laura Kelly to offer the services of the Kansas National Guard to the state of Texas. House Republican leadership including House Majority Leader Rep. Chris Croft, Speaker of the House Rep. Dan Hawkins and Speaker Pro Tem Rep. Blake Carpenter issued the following joint statement regarding HR 6035:

“Millions of individuals have entered our country illegally due to the failures of the Biden Administration, posing a threat to national security, a rise in human trafficking and smuggling, and releasing a deadly influx of fentanyl into our communities. By prohibiting Texas from defending its border, the Biden administration has accelerated and exacerbated these safety concerns to crisis level. We encourage Governor Laura Kelly to join us and stand with Texas to provide any needed support to the Governor of Texas as it protects its citizens and rightfully defends its southern border.”

Officials with the State of Kansas House of Representatives said Representative Pat Proctor (R-Leavenworth), carried the Resolution on the House floor and had this to say:

“The Biden administration has willfully refused to meet its Constitutional responsibility to secure our borders. In response, Texas is exercising its Constitutional, sovereign right to self-defense. And today, the Kansas Legislature said, loud and clear, that we stand with Texas.”

Feb 11 2024,"As governor, Haley took on Obama on immigration. Now she’s fighting Trump",CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2024/02/11/politics/nikki-haley-immigration-policy/index.html,"CNN —

A few months into her first term as governor, Nikki Haley signed one of the strictest immigration bills in the country.

Like Arizona’s infamous “show me your papers” law, the most controversial part of South Carolina’s legislation required law enforcement to check people’s legal status during stops if they suspected they were in the country illegally. Critics said it would lead to racial profiling.

Haley drew on her own background as the daughter of immigrants who came to the country legally to stress that the bill wasn’t about intolerance, but upholding the law.

“This enforces the fact that illegal immigration is not welcome in South Carolina,” Haley said at a press conference after signing the bill. “Legal immigration is more than welcome.”

More than a decade later, Haley’s record on immigration is under fire as former President Donald Trump seeks to make border policy a key part of his campaign to secure the GOP presidential nomination and defeat President Joe Biden in the general election. As Trump and his allies attempt to paint Haley as weak on border security, the former South Carolina governor is pushing back by leaning into both her immigration record in the state and her vision for future federal policy.

This month, Haley criticized Trump for killing a bipartisan border agreement and delaying reforms until after the election. She has pointed to the time she’s spent on the US border with Mexico and laid out a border plan that would add more border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, defund sanctuary cities and increase deportations. And she has stressed that when she was governor, her state pushed back on a former Democratic president.

“We passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country,” Haley said last week at a rally in Aiken, South Carolina. “President Obama sued us over it, and we won.”

Parts of the 2011 law – one provision made it a crime to transport an undocumented person and another made it a crime to fail to carry an alien registration card – were blocked by the courts. Strict guardrails were also placed on when a law enforcement officer could question someone about their legal status and prevented officers from detaining people to investigate.

But key parts remained intact. It tightened rules around employers using the federal E-Verify database to check if employees are able to work in the country legally and created an Immigration Enforcement Unit to target undocumented immigrants suspected of crimes.

“We need to take what we did in South Carolina and we need to go national with it,” Haley said in a digital ad released Monday.

Attacks on immigration

The efforts come in the wake of attacks from Trump and his allies eager to give the former president a decisive win in the Palmetto State’s February 24 primary. The Trump campaign and a super PAC backing the president both released ads ahead of the New Hampshire primary hitting Haley on border policy. And earlier this month, Trump allies held a news conference outside the state capitol on Haley’s “weakness on immigration.”

“Donald Trump knows what the American people want. He’s driving the Trump Train of sensible immigration policy,” South Carolina state Treasurer Curtis Loftis said at the news conference. “Nikki Haley and others have recently jumped on that train, but they’re just passengers.”

Loftis, one of dozens of South Carolina elected officials who have backed Trump over Haley, said the former governor and her allies “benefit from open borders because they love, they thrive, they just enjoy cheap labor at every level of their lives.”

An ad from the Trump campaign said Haley opposed the former president’s border wall and his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the country. Haley has said that she supports a border wall, but thinks a wall alone isn’t enough to stop illegal immigration. When Trump called for a Muslim ban as a candidate, Haley said the proposal was “absolutely un-American.” (As president, Trump limited travel from a list of majority-Muslim countries.)

“The same year Nikki Haley passed one of the toughest immigration laws in the country as governor, Donald Trump was still a New York City liberal donating to Kamala Harris,” Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement. “Nikki knows that we are a country of laws, and the minute that we lose that, we give up everything this country was founded on. South Carolinians know she’ll be tough on illegal immigration as president because she did it already as governor.”

As Haley continues her longshot challenge to Trump, she has struggled to emphasize her Tea Party roots to voters, many of whom see her as a more traditional Republican. While that has helped her with moderates and independents, it has hurt her with conservatives and the bulk of GOP primary voters, who favor Trump overwhelmingly.

A Monmouth University/Washington Post poll released February 1 found that 62% of potential South Carolina Republican primary voters trust Trump most on immigration, 22% said they trust Haley more and 15% said they trust them equally. Overall, Trump led by 26 points, with 58% of voters backing the former president and 32% supporting Haley.

Fighting the Obama administration

Haley’s approach to immigration policy over the last 13 years has closely mirrored changes in the way the Republican Party has juggled the issue. During Obama’s first term in office, South Carolina joined a handful of states that sought to take immigration enforcement into their own hands.

“What we saw happening was a number of states sort of looking to jump on what they saw as a bandwagon of anti-immigrant legislation that I think a lot of people saw as an easy political win,” said Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, one of the groups that challenged the law.

The 2011 immigration law Haley signed was part of a small wave of legislation with “show me your papers” style provisions, which required law enforcement to ask for people’s immigration documents during traffic or other stops if they suspected them of being in the country illegally.

The law, known as Act 69, was soon challenged by the Obama Justice Department and immigrant rights groups. They successfully argued that parts of the laws were preempted by federal law.

“It’s not the job of state law enforcement to enforce immigration law,” said Michelle Lapointe, the deputy director for legal at the National Immigration Law Center. “And that’s been made clear, over and over again, in these court cases.”

Haley’s administration said the federal government wasn’t doing enough.

“If the feds were doing their job, we wouldn’t have had to address illegal immigration reform at the state level,” Rob Godfrey, a spokesman for Haley at the time, said in a statement after a federal judge blocked part of the Act 69. “But, until they do, we’re going to keep fighting in South Carolina to be able to enforce our laws.”

A softer touch

Haley has advocated a hardline immigration policy with less of the inflammatory language used by her peers. She has supported building a wall on the US border with Mexico, adding 25,000 more border patrol and ICE agents, and increasing deportations. But she’s also, over the years, scolded Republicans for the language they use to characterize migrants, particularly after Trump called some migrants “rapists” and said they were bringing crime and drugs into the country.

Haley tried to strike that balance during a 2015 appearance at the Aspen Institute. Asked about how, as the daughter of Indian immigrants, she viewed the tone of immigration discussions, Haley led by saying America is a country of laws.

But she also stressed that America is a country of immigrants.

“We don’t need to talk about them as criminals, they’re not,” she said. “They’re families that want a better life, and they’re desperate to get here. What we need to do is make sure that we have a set of laws that we follow.”

The first part of that quote was used in a pro-Trump super PAC ad that referred to migrants as “drug traffickers, rapists, poisoning our country” and accused Haley of being soft on criminals. The group, MAGA Inc., aired the ad in New Hampshire ahead of the state’s primary last month. “Nikki Haley: too weak, too liberal to fix the border,” the narrator says.

Haley’s 2015 comments came in the wake of the 2012 presidential election, when Republicans sought to regain support among Latino voters. Mitt Romney’s loss to former President Barack Obama, a contest Republicans thought they could win, set off a round of soul searching in the Republican National Committee that culminated in the 2013 Growth & Opportunity Project report, also known as the RNC autopsy.

“As we studied what happened in the 2012 election, it became really pretty clear that a lot of voters just didn’t think Republicans particularly cared about them,” said Henry Barbour, a longtime RNC committeeman from Mississippi and co-author of the report.

The autopsy advised Republicans to push for comprehensive immigration reform, craft a message that acknowledges the unique perspective of the Latino community and take better care in how messaging was relayed.

“The Republican Party is one of tolerance and respect, and we need to ensure that the tone of our message is always reflective of these core principles,” it read.

Then came Trump.

While the former president was able to appeal to working class voters, a group the report didn’t address, his 2016 campaign rejected many of the recommendations about where the party should go.

Barbour, who donated to Haley after Trump vowed that anyone who contributed to her would be “permanently barred from the MAGA camp,” described Haley as “clear eyed” about threats at the border without being exclusionary or divisive. There is still a place in the Republican Party for an approach like hers, he said.

“I think there’s a lot of room for somebody who’s going to be more inclusive,” he said. “Practice the politics of addition – as opposed to the politics of division – but yet be conservative.”"
Feb 26 2024,"AP report on Laken Riley murder omits suspect's immigration status, focuses on dangers of women jogging alone",Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ap-report-laken-riley-murder-omits-suspects-immigration-status-focuses-dangers-women-jogging-alone,"Conservatives called out the Associated Press on Sunday for appearing to categorize Laken Riley’s murder as more about the ""fears of solo female athletes"" rather than illegal immigration and weak crime laws.

Riley, an Augusta University nursing student, was found dead Thursday after previously attending the University of Georgia before entering a nursing program at Augusta's Athens campus, where she made the Dean's List.

Police have charged Jose Antonio Ibarra with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call and concealing the death of another. By Sunday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) also confirmed that Ibarra entered the U.S. illegally in 2022 and had previously been arrested in New York City.

However, the AP published an article on the murder on Saturday without referencing Ibarra’s immigration or criminal record and instead focused on how Riley was murdered while jogging by herself.

CONSERVATIVES OUTRAGED AFTER AXIOS REPOSTS ARTICLE CLAIMING SOUTHERN BORDER IS 'MORE FORTIFIED' THAN EVER

""Riley’s death has once again put the spotlight on the dangers female runners face. Previously, the 2018 death of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts while out jogging prompted an outpouring from other women who shared their tales of being harassed and followed,"" the article read.

Several social media users called out this angle for focusing only on ""female runners"" and referring to Ibarra as an ""Athens resident"" rather than noting Tibbetts was killed by an illegal immigrant, and another is suspected in the murder of Riley. A separate AP report on Saturday mentioned the police didn't know the suspects immigration status yet, but it wasn't updated as of Sunday evening.

""Pretty sure that's not the lesson here,"" The Spectator contributing editor Stephen Miller commented.

In a longer post, Outkick columnist Mary Katharine Ham wrote, ""Hi, female athlete here. I ran this exact trail every single week of my college career. I guess I could have been snuffed out before I graduated, had a career, family, and the professionals at the AP would lie about the suspect bc it fits a preferred narrative.""

She continued, ""Ibarra is not merely an ‘Athens resident,’ and Laken Riley and every other student was put in danger by not enforcing laws and allowing a man arrested 3x after crossing the border to hang out and work on campus. He had to escalate to alleged murder to be held and/or risk deportation. Good policies. Good work. This story even cites the 2018 murder of Mollie Tibbetts in IA as a reason solo female runners should be worried, *also without noting her killer was an illegal immigrant.* Just stop lying!""

BIDEN ADMIN FACING MOUNTING BACKLASH AFTER MIGRANT ATTACKS HOMEOWNER, STEALS FLAG: 'BECOMING A TREND'

""It really is jaw dropping how hard the media will work to avoid mentioning any aspect of a story that makes their political party or progressive ideology look bad,"" fellow Outkick writer Ian Miller wrote.

RealClearPolitics co-founder Tom Bevan posted, ""Just insane framing. The media never fails to disappoint.""

""The answer is to disarm them and allow in more illegal alien criminals,"" Townhall.com columnist Kurt Schlichter wrote.

Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy said, ""Arrested (illegal alien from Venezuela illegally released by Biden) ‘Athens resident.’ But sure, NOW the AP cares about this antiquated idea of ‘female.’""

""By tomorrow the AP will be tying this to climate change,"" Twitchy’s Doug Powers joked.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Associated Press for a comment.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, ICE confirmed Ibarra had been encountered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Sept. 8, 2022 after entering near El Paso and was ""paroled and released for further processing.""

ICE also confirmed that Ibarra had been arrested by the New York Police Department a year later, on Sept. 14, 2023, and ""charged with acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation.""

Feb 15 2024,Suozzi’s win in New York may offer hope to Democrats nationwide on immigration,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/2857580/tom-suozzi-win-new-york-democrats-nationwide-immigration,"Former Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi’s victory in a suburban New York district on Tuesday night could provide national Democrats with a road map heading into the November election.

Suozzi, who easily defeated Republican opponent Mazi Pilip to replace expelled former Republican Rep. George Santos, made immigration a centerpiece of his campaign, going on the offensive on the thorny issue that has been vexing Democrats and President Joe Biden.



As illegal border crossings reached record levels in December and a surge of immigrants flooded into New York, Suozzi flipped the narrative, blaming Republicans for playing political games after they rejected a bipartisan immigration deal in recent days, which the New York Democrat has said he would support.



Throughout his campaign, Suozzi advocated tougher border policy and often spoke about closing the U.S.-Mexico border to slow the influx of immigrants. He also took his opponent head-on, rushing to a migrant shelter in Queens to hold a press conference in response to statements from Pilip that linked him to the nation’s border crisis.

“Stop running around for Trump and start running the country,” Suozzi said, slamming Republicans in his victory speech on Tuesday.

Immigration has become one of the top election-year concerns for voters, and that was reflected across the television ads in the special election, according to Ad Impact, an advertising tracking firm.

Pilip went after Suozzi in ads on immigration, highlighting New York City’s woes in getting the influx of asylum-seekers under control. However, Suozzi and his allies fought back, and a political action committee supporting him ran ads touting his previous work on bipartisan immigration legislation.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) even acknowledged Suozzi seemed to have broken through with voters on immigration.

“He sounded like a Republican, talking about the border and immigration,” Johnson said on Wednesday, speaking with reporters. “Everybody knows that’s the top issue.”



Suozzi’s victory, which occurred in a district where Republicans have won every major election in the last three years, narrowed the Republican House majority to 219-213.

Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist based in New York, said national Democrats should follow Suozzi’s lead by tackling immigration head-on.

“Stop burying your head in the ground. This is one of the most important issues to voters. Tom Suozzi is giving you a playbook. Rip a page out of it,” Reinish said. “It’s been a pet peeve of mine for so long — what Washington Democrats sort of live in the politics of 25 years ago, where you can just sort of ignore an issue and it’s going to go away. It’s not.”

“The border is a top issue for voters — crime and public safety, top issues for voters. Go and talk about it, confront the issue, and don’t cede ground and let the Republicans own it,” he added.

While many Democrats may view Suozzi’s win with a rosy outlook heading into a critical election year, others believe this special election result isn’t a great indicator of what is to come for national Democrats.

New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf points out that Pilip was not a very strong opponent, particularly after her initial financial disclosure drew scrutiny and was missing required information.

“His opponent had an ethical issue akin to what Santos experienced, the financial disclosure. And that was a lucky, lucky stroke at the end,” Sheinkopf said.

Sheinkopf also points out that Suozzi, 61, has spent nearly three decades in public office and is well known by the community, which could have contributed to his win. In addition, Democrats outspent Republicans 2-to-1 in the race.

“He and the Democrats probably spent $14 [million] to $15 million. That’s an awful amount of money; it’s an extraordinary amount of money,” he said. “If Republicans can raise more than Democrats, which is likely, it’ll be harder for Democrats to break through on the migration issue. It also depends on if crime is up by migrants in particular areas.”

However, many believe Suozzi’s win represents a path for other centrist Democratic candidates in swing districts, particularly those where a surge of immigrants is straining local resources.

“I would immediately seize what I’m now comfortable calling the Suozzi playbook — and Joe Biden should do the exact same thing. So should Sherrod Brown, Jon Tester, Tammy Baldwin, etc.,” Reinish said."
Feb 17 2024,Right-wing immigration misinformation crosses over to Spanish amid border bill debate,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/immigration-misinformation-right-wing-spanish-social-media-radio-rcna138654,"Most of the Spanish-language misinformation about immigration that Latinos see on social media or listen to on the radio seems to largely mirror the falsehoods spread by right-wing media outlets in English, according to two groups tracking misinformation in Spanish.

Researchers monitoring Spanish-language misinformation found that anti-immigrant rhetoric and false narratives increased as coverage of the Senate’s border security and foreign aid bill gained traction in recent weeks. Misinformation and falsehoods continued to cross over into Spanish even after the border security provisions that would have funded federal immigration agencies to ramp up detention and deportation efforts were removed from the bipartisan legislation, leaving behind just the provisions concerning aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.

During the weeks in which the bill was being debated, researchers noticed a surge in posts spreading anti-immigrant narratives such as the “great replacement” theory, which posits that Democrats encourage immigration as part of a conspiracy to wipe out the white race, according to Randy Abreu, policy counsel at the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a Latino media advocacy nonprofit. In general, misinformation broadly distorts facts to present false or inaccurate information.

“We may only be looking at a tip of an iceberg ... This is concerning,” he told NBC News. At the nonprofit, Abreu leads the Spanish Language Disinformation Coalition, which is made up of at least six organizations that do general monitoring of misinformation in Spanish.

Sergio Muñoz, vice president of research and policy at Media Matters, a left-leaning nonprofit media watchdog founded by political consultant David Brock, also leads a team of researchers who follow the opposing immigration narratives in both English and Spanish.

Muñoz told NBC News that the group’s overall assessment was that Spanish-language misinformation on immigration was “largely an echo of what we were seeing on the English-language side,” especially when it came to “reactions to the border bill and the subsequent collapse of it.”

In two recent reports, Media Matters detailed some of the English-language misinformation being spread by Fox News and other conservative media outlets and personalities around the border security and foreign aid bill. These include false claims made by former President Donald Trump and his allies, even before the bill’s text was published, suggesting that the legislation would allow 5,000 migrants to illegally cross the southern border every day, as well as other false statements from lawmakers and conservative media personalities saying the bill would have codified “invasion” and “mass amnesty.”

The bill did not include a provision stating it would legalize any undocumented people in the country or authorize the entrance for large numbers of migrants.

Fox News did not respond to a request for comment.

Based on their monitoring efforts, Abreu said they saw very few Spanish-language posts on social media specifically focused on spreading these falsehoods about the border bill. Regardless of whether the comments are being widely viewed or not, they provide a glimpse into how this rhetoric may be resonating with some Spanish-speaking Latinos online, Abreu said.

Abreu said his organization mainly came across posts spreading anti-immigrant falsehoods, such as the “great replacement” theory, on social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok and Twitter.

The posts contained a “significant amount of comments” in Spanish that directly referenced misinformation that had emerged in English, particularly on the topic of allowing 5,000 illegal migrant crossings daily, he said.

A TikTok spokesperson told NBC News that the platform uses “automated technology, user reports, proactive searches and trend reports from experts” to detect misinformation across different languages, but “will continue to deepen our work with experts in Spanish-language misinformation this year.” The company also said it partners with several fact-checking organizations such as Lead Stories that cover Spanish-language misinformation.

According to YouTube, its “community guidelines apply to all content in the platform in any language, including Spanish.” The guidelines include policies on “hate and harassment, harmful or dangerous acts, or promoting human smuggling services.” Additionally, the company said their systems “prominently feature content from authoritative sources,” including Spanish-language news outlets like Telemundo and Univision in their recommendations and search results.

Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.

Anti-immigrant rhetoric has also resonated with users in social media platforms owned by Meta, such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. According to a Media Matters report released last week, the company earned at least $397,500 from 450 anti-immigration ads that ran on its platforms between October and February. The ads included terms such as “invade,” “invaded,” “invaders,” “invasion,” or “invading” to describe U.S. immigration, and garnered at least 15.5 million impressions combined. An overwhelming majority of the ads came from conservative groups, the report said.

Meta said the ads analyzed in the Media Matters report do not violate their community and advertising standards. The company also said it partners with nearly 100 independent fact-checking organizations worldwide who review and rate viral misinformation in more than 60 languages, including English and Spanish.

Media Matters also provided NBC News with additional examples of how false narratives about the defunct border bill were also being spread by two Spanish-language radio shows in South Florida.

Researchers at Media Matters found that some conservative pundits on these shows echoed false claims that the border bill would lead to mass migrant crossings and falsely suggested that President Joe Biden can fix issues at the border on his own — rendering the bill unnecessary and suggesting that Biden is only looking to act now on the issue because of the upcoming election.

“This is factually incorrect,” Muñoz said. “This was a talking point that was crossing easily over from English language to Spanish language.”

The advocacy nonprofit American Immigration Council and the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a voluntary organization, released policy brief analyses in English debunking what the bill was and was not in an effort to counter some of this immigration misinformation.

Greg Chen, director of government relations at AILA, told NBC News during a call with reporters last week that even Biden contributed to the misinformation when he responded to criticism from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., suggesting the bill would have given him “new emergency authority to shut down the border.”

According to AILA’s analysis, that’s not true. The bill would have provided the Biden administration with the ability “to rapidly expel asylum-seekers,” resulting in “people being denied access to asylum,” Chen clarified.

“The lack of accurate information about the issue means that the debate is no longer one about policy and facts,” he added.

Who’s monitoring for misinformation?

Considering that content moderation efforts are “much less rigorous on Spanish language than they are in English language” across multiple platforms, Muñoz said he anticipates “a proliferation and concentration of misinformation that could be avoided by just simply bringing up to parity Spanish-language moderation with English-language moderation.”

Meta did not tell NBC News how many content moderators the company has, but a 2023 company report of their operation in the European Union said that as of September they had at least 163 Spanish-language moderators and 109 English-language content moderators. In their report, the company said they had “additional content reviewers” in other regions for both languages but did not specify how many. Meta did tell NBC News that it plans to launch fact-checking tip lines in Spanish on WhatsApp, expanding their capacity to address misinformation in the Spanish-language communities that use the platform.

In similar company reports about their European Union operations, X said that as of October it had just 20 content moderators with linguistic expertise in Spanish, compared to 2,294 content moderators with linguistic expertise in English. TikTok had 468 Spanish-language content moderators and 2,137 English-language content moderators as of September. YouTube reported having 507 people moderating content in Spanish versus 15,142 people moderating content in English, also as of September. No company provided information to NBC News about how many content moderators they have in the U.S.

“Without a doubt, it is a threat,” Abreu said. “The reason this is concerning still today is because very little has been done in terms of content moderation, in terms of live fact-checking,” especially in Spanish.

Feb 16 2024,"Federal judge skeptical of Texas' sweeping immigration law, says ruling will come 'soon'",Yahoo News,left,https://yahoo.com/news/federal-judge-skeptical-texas-sweeping-110701351.html,"A federal judge plans to quickly issue a ruling in a lawsuit over legislation designed to institute new penalties for illegal border crossings.

David Ezra, judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, said Thursday he will soon make the ruling on whether Senate Bill 4 is constitutional.

The bill is a state-level effort to curb illegal border crossings in Texas.

During a three-hour hearing, Ezra on many occasions bemoaned the confrontation between state and federal authority that SB 4 instigates in an effort to give Texas' law enforcement the ability to arrest, detain and deport those thought to have entered the country illegally.

Federal prosecutors take issue with provisions under the bill that give state officials the ability to exercise authority over a person's entry or removal from the country. They also decried the legislation as a hindrance to international relations, a violation of foreign commerce laws and an affront to the existing judicial process.

Federal prosecutors have categorically rebutted the state's ability to make decisions in the immigration arena. They argued throughout the hearing and in previous filings that it's an issue entirely under the purview of the federal government.

""While SB 4 would inflict concrete, irreparable harms on the United States, Texas fails to show that its absence will have any material impact,"" prosecutors wrote in the days leading up to the hearing.

Kristin Etter of the Texas Immigration Law Council speaks at a news conference Thursday before a federal court hearing in Austin about the constitutionality of Senate Bill 4.

Prosecutors also argue Texas' immigration law is based on the idea that the state has been forced to face an invasion by itself, which is not the case and, even so, legal precedent does not allow for the actions being taken to repel immigration.

More: Texas Latinos as large a voting bloc as ever. What this means for Democrats and Republicans

""There's been no abandonment here,"" U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said Thursday.

What is SB 4 and when would go into effect

Passed by the Legislature in November, SB 4 creates a series of penalties for those suspected of coming into Texas from Mexico other than through a legal international port of entry. The penalties range from a Class B misdemeanor to a second-degree felony.

SB 4, which is set to go into effect on March 5, requires people accused of illegally crossing the state's southern border to either accept a magistrate judge's deportation order or face a second-degree felony charge for noncompliance.

The law was immediately challenged in court after its passage.

Federal prosecutors entered their lawsuit in January, suing the state of Texas and joining a previous lawsuit filed late last year by the ACLU, ACLU of Texas, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, American Gateways, the Texas Civil Rights Project and the County of El Paso.

Ryan Walters of the Texas attorney general's office leaves after Thursday's court hearing where he defended SB 4.

Gov. Greg Abbott and others praise SB 4, while judge expresses skepticism

In a campaign visit alongside Gov. Greg Abbott to the border last week, state Rep. David Spiller, R-Jacksboro, celebrated carrying SB 4 through the House, calling the legislation a ""landmark"" bill.

""It's not preempted by existing federal immigration law,"" Spiller said during the border news conference. ""It's not in conflict with federal immigration law, that's in place and, mostly, Texas has the right, the constitutional right and authority, to secure its border.""

Expressing skepticism, and at times criticism, of the legislation's structure, Ezra disagreed with the bill's author during Thursday's hearing, addressing concerns over the due process of migrants, the feasibility of the state's removal process and the ramifications of Texas setting a precedent for other states to follow in rejecting federal authority.

Although Ezra reiterated on multiple occasions that he views the complaints from state officials stemming from the border to be legitimate, citing previous experience adjudicating on the immigration issue previously in Arizona, California and South Texas.

David Donatti of the ACLU of Texas talks to reporters about SB 4, which the organization opposes.

But the question that wakes him up at 2:30 a.m., Ezra told attorneys during the hearing, is what happens when other states begin to follow Texas' example and introduce their own immigration interpretations, neglecting federal law in the process.

""And that's precisely the same thing that the Civil War said you can't do,"" Ezra said.

Texas argues in support of its immigration law, claims it's facing invasion alone

Ryan Walters, chief of special litigation in the Texas attorney general's office, argued that the state's attempt at immigration law should be seen as a mirror policy to those of the federal government and necessary on account of increasing immigration patterns.

More: How the border crisis sparked the worst Texas-federal relationship in modern memory

Walters, in front of the court and in previous filings, argued that seeking to delay the implementation of the law is not necessary as the concerns are based on situations that have not yet occurred.

Meanwhile, a group of nearly 50 members of Congress have signed an amicus brief, backing Texas' argument that the state has faced an invasion that has necessitated its own immigration policy.

From left, Mori Leyva, Heather Malkawi and Bryce Lambeth unfurl a banner protesting SB 4 outside Austin's U.S. Courthouse on Thursday.

""In the absence of any meaningful federal action, Texas has taken several measures to secure its borders and repel the invasion of criminal drug cartels and the flood of illegal aliens from around the world whom the cartels traffic into Texas."" the lawmakers, led by U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Lubbock, wrote in their brief.

There is also concern SB 4 could lead to an increase in arrests and strain the criminal justice system, the Harris County district attorney's office wrote in a separate amicus brief. Roughly 80,000 people could face charges, according to previous legislative testimony from the Texas Department of Public Safety.

Mandatory sentences under SB 4, which range between six months and 20 years, will affect the county's jail costs and possibly force further outsourcing of jail operations, the letter argues.

Additionally, community members might be more fearful of approaching law enforcement upon the implementation of the law, which is set to go into effect March 5.

When will the judge rule on SB 4

Saying he expects any ruling will be promptly appealed, Ezra said he expects to rule on whether to grant an injunction of SB 4 prior to the new law taking effect in March.

""I will try to get my decision out as quickly as I possibly can,"" Ezra said.

Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP

A bipartisan plan to address U.S. asylum and border control policy faces major skepticism Monday as at least two dozen Senate Republicans cast serious doubt on the legislation's chances.

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., one of the negotiators who wrote the bill, told reporters in the Capitol that he does not think a planned Wednesday vote on a motion start debate can be approved.

""We are trying to figure out what to do next,"" Lankford said. ""People are saying hey, we need a lot more time to go through this.""

Lankford spoke to reporters after a lengthy closed-door GOP meeting where members vented — sometimes angrily — about the bill.

""I think the proposal is dead,"" Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said bluntly.

Lankford would not go that far. He told reporters that it was clear the bill would need to be amended in order to garner more Republican support. But moving any further to the right risks losing enough Democrats to reach the 60-vote threshold.

The newly-released $118 billion national security bill includes roughly $20 billion for border provisions, including $650 million for the border wall and funding for asylum judges, expanded detention capacity and other programs.

The proposal would also raise the threshold to meet asylum claims, mandate a 90-day initial determination of eligibility and require Border Protection agents to turn away all migrants who enter between official ports of entry if the total number of encounters reaches a certain threshold.

The bill is the result of months of negotiations following GOP demands that Democrats link border policy to President Biden's request for military aid to Israel and Ukraine.

Republican concerns

The doubts from Senate Republicans follow days of pressure from House Republicans and former President Trump to dump the bill before the details were made public. The opposition ramped up in the hours after the bill was released.

""Any consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time,"" House Republican leaders said in a statement. ""It is DEAD on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it.""

""Only a fool, or a Radical Left Democrat, would vote for this horrendous Border Bill,"" Trump posted on Truth Social.

Some, like Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, echoed that message on Monday.

""These are sort of pretty massive concessions to Democratic policy goals,"" Vance told reporters. ""I'm not sure what Republicans got out of it.""

""I think overall the members that have already come out and said no, I think it is hard to overcome that and the attitude of the House,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a member of the Senate GOP leadership. ""I am very disappointed that so many of our members came out as a hard no before the legislation was even released.""

""I wish we had given James [Lankford] the benefit of the doubt to take a look at the text before we started speaking our opposition,"" Ernst said.

Democratic frustration

""I hope they didn't send Senator Lankford and the rest of us out on a fool's errand,"" lead negotiator Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told reporters.

""There are certainly some typically Republican-aligned groups that are supportive,"" Murphy said, referring to an endorsement from a Border Protection agents' union, ""but Trump seems to be a bit of a puppeteer these days. I hope that's not true with respect to this bill.""

While the bulk of Senate Democrats appear to support the proposal, there are a few lawmakers who have come out against the proposal.

""After months of a negotiating process that lacked transparency or the involvement of a single border state Democrat,"" Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., said in a statement, ""the deal includes a new version of a failed Trump-era immigration policy that will cause more chaos at the border, not less."""

It includes a new border authority to allow Title 42-style expulsions when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a 7-day rolling average, narrows asylum eligibility while expediting the process, provides additional work permits for asylum seekers and funds a massive increase in staffing at the border, in the immigration courts and asylum offices.

It is facing considerable heat from conservatives, including in the Republican-controlled House, where lawmakers have claimed the deal will regularize high levels of illegal immigration, while funding non-governmental organizations and gives legal aid to illegal immigrants. Some on the left have also objected to the bill due to its failure to include a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants already in the U.S.

Scott slammed the bill as ""unsatisfactory and unnecessary"" as he argued that Biden is already able to secure the border without a power that Scott believes allows too many migrant crossings before it is activated. Biden has said he can't secure the border without fixes to a ""broken"" immigration system and additional funding.

""I think it's such a lie to think that Joe Biden needs Congress to act in order for him to secure the border,"" Scott said.

He also objected that the bill is being coupled with $60 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel, saying those issues should be debated and passed separately.

5 KEY DETAILS IN CONTROVERSIAL SENATE BORDER DEAL

""We're going to spend $60 billion for Ukraine, and we already need accountability in the resources that we're spending,"" he said. ""What brought us to this point, the crisis in Israel, $14 or so billion. We are making a critical mistake in using our ally Israel's crisis to put more money into Ukraine and less real attention on the border,"" he said.

""I'm thankful that we are finally having a conversation about the border, but it's the wrong one. It should be in a silo. We should be fixing and securing our southern border, and the president of the United States can do that right now,"" he said. ""He undid what [former President Donald] Trump secures for us. Joe Biden did it by himself. He literally shredded a secure border with his actions as president.""

Scott, who recently ended his 2024 bid for president and backed Trump for his White House bid, said that he would first take care of Israel on its own, then have a standalone bill to deal with the border crisis.

""It would actually acknowledge the fact that the vast majority of people coming across our border aren't from Mexico,"" he said. ""Literally, Chinese nationals are coming across our southern border at record numbers, we see 150 plus countries represented on our southern border. So if we were to do an effective job, we would have these in silo packages so that we could actually confront the problem facing this nation to include what I believe are sleeper cells in our nation, because …the Biden administration, they have not monitored who's coming in our country with an 85% release ratio, with 10 million people coming in by the election.""

GOP SENATORS DEMAND ‘ADEQUATE TIME’ TO REVIEW BORDER SECURITY BILL

Scott contrasted that with the stance taken by the Trump administration, which he sees as a success in controlling illegal migration into the U.S.

""The key was the desire to have a secure border number one,"" he said. ""The second was the tenacity and the fortitude to take the necessary steps to secure our border, to include the Remain in Mexico policy, to include seeking asylum in a country that's contiguous with yours, to include looking at putting more focus on Mexico's other border, not our border, and of course, the, codifying a wall and the funding for it,"" he said."
Feb 05 2024,House Republican Leaders Declare Senate Immigration Bill ‘Dead on Arrival’,American Greatness,right,https://amgreatness.com/2024/02/05/house-republican-leaders-declare-senate-immigration-bill-dead-on-arrival,"House Republican Leaders released a joint statement Monday declaring the “bipartisan” Senate immigration bill “dead on arrival,” and “a waste of time” in its current form.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), GOP Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), and House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) said that House Republicans are rejecting the Senate’s legislation “because it fails in every policy area needed to secure our border and would actually incentivize more illegal immigration.”

The GOP leaders urged the Senate to take up the the tougher immigration bill the House passed last year.

Among its many flaws, the bill expands work authorizations for illegal aliens while failing to include critical asylum reforms. Even worse, its language allowing illegals to be ‘released from physical custody’ would effectively endorse the Biden ‘catch and release’ policy. The so-called ‘shutdown’ authority in the bill is anything but, riddled with loopholes that grant far too much discretionary authority to Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas – who has proven he will exploit every measure possible, in defiance of the law, to keep the border open. The bill also fails to adequately stop the President’s abuse of parole authority and provides for taxpayer funds to fly and house illegal immigrants in hotels through the FEMA Shelter and Services Program. Because President Biden has refused to utilize his broad executive authority to end the border catastrophe that he has created, the House led nine months ago with the passage of the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2). That bill contains the necessary components to actually stem the flow of illegals and end the present crisis. The Senate must take it up immediately. Any consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time. It is DEAD on arrival in the House. We encourage the U.S. Senate to reject it.

The GOP leaders said “America’s sovereignty is at stake.”

Monday morning, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” framed opposition to the Senate immigration bill as the work of Donald Trump, MAGA “extremists” and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) urged Johnson to ignore the naysayers and “do the right thing to fix the border.”

Schumer said if the bill isn’t passed, a number of worldwide calamities would ensue and U.S. troops might have to be sent to Ukraine to fight in the war against Russia.

Joe Biden released a statement on Sunday urging congress to “pass the bill immediately.”

During a news conference in Miami Monday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the Senate Bill a “farce” and a “dog and pony show” that will just exacerbate the border crisis.

“People are starting to point out what a farce it is to basically say that you only shut the border down once 5,000 people a day come in illegally, which is about two million a year,” DeSantis said. “That’s basically legalizing illegal immigration.”

“[This] shows me the contempt these people in D.C. have for American taxpayers. The amount of money they want to send all around the world, the amount of money that they’re saying they’ll use for border, but it’s really going to go to facilitate more of the problem, I just think the whole thing is a farce,” DeSantis continued.

“The fact of the matter is, the president has the authority to secure the country’s border. You don’t need a new piece of legislation to do that. Just do it!” the Florida governor said.

While touting Florida’s booming economy, DeSantis also cited last week’s CNN story that alleged illegal immigrant criminal gangs go to Florida to spend money after committing crimes in Democrat sanctuary states.

“Heck, even the criminals spend their money [in Florida]. Did you see the story?” he quipped.

“You had CNN [panel discussing] why don’t they just steal in Florida? They’re like, because they’ll go to jail if they steal in Florida!”"
Feb 05 2024,‘Amnesty’ or border crackdown? What’s in the Senate’s $20 billion immigration deal?,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/2836604/revealed-senate-border-deal-details/,"Senate leadership released the text of a bipartisan compromise on the border Sunday evening, the product of four months of painstaking negotiations.

Elements of the deal, brokered by a bipartisan working group, had been teased in the days leading up to its release. However, the granular details offered by the text itself will determine how much support the bill receives in the Senate. The bill, part of a larger national security supplemental, will be considered as soon as Wednesday.

The negotiations have been a lightning rod for controversy ever since they began in earnest, with apparent leaks threatening to derail the legislation before it ever came to light.

It’s been called everything from an amnesty to the toughest border security legislation in the last three decades. But what’s actually in the deal, which carries a whopping $20 billion price tag?

Title 42-like authority

The centerpiece of the legislation is a new expulsion authority for the president that allows him to turn away immigrants when border crossings surge.

That authority is granted at a weekly average of 4,000 encounters a day. But it becomes mandatory at a weekly threshold of 5,000 a day or when crossings reach 8,500 in a single day.

For context, crossings regularly broke 10,000 a day in the record-setting month of December.

The idea of the authority is to shut down the border when authorities become overwhelmed, but conservatives have framed the provision as codifying thousands of illegal crossings a day. House GOP leadership pointed to the threshold in declaring the legislation “dead on arrival” on Sunday night.

Senate negotiators have dismissed that characterization as “misinformation,” describing the authority, which expires after three years, as critical to gaining “operational control” of the border.

The authority, which would become available immediately after enactment, is similar to the Title 42 powers used during the coronavirus pandemic to turn immigrants away but would also bar repeat border crossers from entering the country legally for a year.

There are exceptions to the shutdown power. A minimum of 1,400 immigrants a day would be processed at legal ports of entry, and agents could not turn away unaccompanied children or those facing an imminent threat to their lives.

The 1,400-plus immigrants would be under government supervision and removed if they failed to prove their claims for asylum.

Finally, crossings would have to drop below 75% of the trigger number for a week before the border could be reopened.

Asylum

The other major change touted by negotiators is the deal’s asylum provisions.

The legislation would create a stricter standard for initial asylum screenings, meaning more immigrants would be quickly deported. Those screenings would take place in detention and within 90 days.

For these reasons, the negotiators hail the bill as an end to “catch and release.”

Additional resources would be allocated for detention beds, asylum officers, border agents, and more. The capacity of 34,000 beds would be increased to 50,000, for example, while funding would be provided for up to 77 repatriation flights a day.

Those who cannot be detained, such as family units, would be released but monitored, either with a bracelet, cellphone, or comparable technology.

Immigrants who pass the initial screening would receive a work permit, and if their final screenings were to be successful, they would be eligible for a path to citizenship under the law.

The entire process must be resolved within 180 days, or six months. The time frame, which negotiators compare to the decadelong backlog in the court system, is meant to allay concerns that immigrants will disappear into the interior of the country.

The bar for asylum is not raised for the second and final screening. But three factors considered at the end of the process would instead be considered at the beginning: Does the immigrant have a criminal history? Was the immigrant living in a safe third country? And could that person have relocated safely within their own country?

Four out of five people pass through the initial screening despite fewer than 15% ultimately qualifying for asylum, according to Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ), one of the lead negotiators.

Importantly, the cases would be handled by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services rather than the courts, so the Department of Homeland Security would be given 90 days to hire and train the asylum officers needed for the new system before it takes effect.

Parole

The most controversial element of the proposal, particularly for negotiators, was President Joe Biden’s use of parole, an authority the president has used to admit more than a million immigrants into the country. Curbing that power, used sparingly in past administrations, remained a sticking point into the final days of negotiations.

The legislation does narrow the president’s authority at land ports of entry. Around 1,500 immigrants are paroled into the country each day, according to Sen. James Lankford (R-OK), using a Customs and Border Protection phone app that allows immigrants to schedule an appointment at land ports. The legislation would end that practice after 90 days.

It also restricts the use of parole for illegal border crossers between ports of entry.

Democrats celebrated the preservation of class-based parole, however. The bill keeps intact programs that the administration has used to admit hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela on humanitarian grounds.

Other provisions

The president used his parole authority to admit thousands of Afghans after the 2021 withdrawal. That authority allows for temporary resettlement, including work authorization, but does not grant legal status. Accordingly, the bill includes the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would provide a process for permanent residence for those Afghans.

Also included is the FEND Off Fentanyl Act, which empowers the administration to target entities that produce or smuggle fentanyl.

There are several changes to the visa system. An additional 250,000 visas would be authorized over five years. In addition, “Documented Dreamers,” those who came to the United States as children of high-skill workers but lost legal status at age 21, would be protected from deportation due to the green card backlog.

The legislation would include $650 million in border wall funding but also Democratic deal-sweeteners, including guaranteed legal counsel for unaccompanied minors and those deemed mentally incompetent.

There are no amnesty provisions for the current undocumented population."
Feb 25 2024,"Brian Kemp blasts Biden's immigration policies after illegal alien's reported murder of Laken Hope Riley, demands answers",The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/brian-kemp-biden-laken-riley-murder,"Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp blasted President Joe Biden over his immigration policies in the aftermath of the murder of a 22-year-old nursing student who was believed to have been brutally killed by an illegal alien.

As Blaze News reported, Augusta University nursing student Laken Hope Riley was viciously murdered while she was jogging. The body of Riley was discovered in a wooded area on the University of Georgia campus on Thursday.

University of Georgia Police Chief Jeffrey Clark said Riley died of blunt force trauma.

On Friday, police arrested 26-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra.

Ibarra was charged with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated battery, aggravated assault, false imprisonment, kidnapping, hindering a 911 call, and concealing the death of another.

Clark described the murder as a ""crime of opportunity.""

Ibarra reportedly lived at an apartment building located on the edge of the park where Riley was jogging.

Clarke noted that Ibarra is not a U.S. citizen and did not attend the university.

Ibarra is an illegal immigrant from Venezuela who crossed illegally into El Paso, Texas, in September 2022 and was released into the U.S. via parole, sources within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Department of Homeland Security told Fox News.

On Saturday, Kemp fired off a letter to Biden demanding answers regarding the porous U.S. southern border and the overwhelming illegal immigration crisis.

""As I have stated many times in the past, your actions and those of your administration have resulted in every state in the country experiencing the disastrous impacts of an unsecured U.S. southern border,"" Kemp began his letter to Biden. ""More than nine million illegal immigrants have crossed the border since you took office – with an additional, unknown number of migrants who were not detained and processed – while at least 58 people on the terror watchlist have been encountered between ports of entry this fiscal year alone.""

""While the dangers of this crisis have never been theoretical, this week our state witnessed a devastating tragedy,"" Kemp said, referring to the brutal murder of Riley.

Kemp also said, ""Laken Riley's tragic death struck the hearts of Georgians everywhere and has rightfully sparked national outrage. As I have said many times before: every state is now a border state because of Joe Biden's inaction, and today I am again demanding answers and information from the Biden Administration that will help us protect our citizens when the federal government will not.""

Kemp pointed out that Ibarra's brother, Diego Ibarra, was arrested for presenting law enforcement with a fake green card when questioned about his murder suspect sibling. Diego Ibarra was arrested and charged with possessing a fraudulent U.S. permanent resident card.

The Republican governor of Georgia noted that Diego Ibarra was arrested multiple times. According to NewsNation, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, driving without a license, and for ""failure to appear for a fingerprintable offense.""

Kemp demanded that the Biden administration provide governors with the resources to be made aware of illegal aliens living in states while asylum claims are being processed.

""Frankly, Mr. President, your continued silence in response to these reasonable requests is outrageous,"" Kemp declared. ""The American people deserve to know who is illegally entering our country due to your administration’s failures, and what risks and challenges every state must now face.""

Kemp asked Biden, ""Why was my administration not made aware of the asylum claims and subsequent release of an illegal resident who presented fraudulent identification? What is the current immigration status of Jose Antonio Ibarra and why has this information not been relayed to my administration? What additional information does your administration possess regarding these individuals and the circumstances surrounding their entry into the country?""

""These tragedies are not unique to Georgia. While we will continue to support Texas with National Guard resources as we have since 2019, federal action to secure the border is the only way to wholistically address this ongoing crisis and ensure Laken Riley's horrible fate is not replicated across the country. However, if you continue to refuse to exercise your authority as president, your administration must provide the information necessary for Georgia and other states to protect our citizens,"" Kemp concluded.

Georgia Rep. Mike Collins (R-Athens) took Biden to task and even accused the president of having Riley's blood on his hands.

“The blood of Laken Riley is on the hands of Joe Biden, Alejandro Mayorkas, and the government of Athens-Clarke County,"" Collins proclaimed. ""The Venezuelan suspect in Laken Riley’s murder is one of millions of illegal aliens that the Biden administration has released into this country to be welcomed with open arms by Democrat-run sanctuary jurisdictions. This man had no business being in America, much less the UGA community to brutally murder this young American while she was on a run.""

Former President Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican primary, defeating the state's former governor, Nikki Haley, NBC News projects. South Carolina's polls closed at 7 p.m. ET, and Trump's victory was projected by networks and wire services within minutes. ""This was a lot sooner than we anticipated,"" Trump said at a party in Columbia, South Carolina following the results. ""It's an early evening and fantastic one."" Trump's widely expected win further cements his status as the likely Republican nominee, though he still needs a total of 1,215 delegates to officially secure the nomination. Just after 10 p.m. ET, Trump was holding a statewide edge of more than 20 points over Haley, according to NBC News. Until then, Haley is determined to keep the GOP primary a two-person race. On Tuesday, Haley pledged to stay on the campaign trail through Super Tuesday on March 5, even if she lost her home state's Saturday primary. After losing to Trump on Saturday, Haley doubled down on that promise.

""I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for president,"" Haley said in Charleston, South Carolina, after Trump's projected victory. ""I'm a woman of my word."" She added that she would be campaigning in Michigan on Sunday and in various Super Tuesday states throughout the coming week. Haley's campaign confirmed that she has the funding to keep her afloat after a record fundraising month in January. ""We have the resources to go the distance,"" a spokesperson for Haley's campaign told CNBC on Tuesday. The former U.N. ambassador has yet to win a race this primary season, though she managed to pull out a slimmer loss against Trump in New Hampshire due to the state's wide population of undeclared voters. Going into Saturday's primary, South Carolina was much less undecided. Trump held a roughly 30-point lead against Haley, according to a February survey from USA Today and Suffolk University, disintegrating any hopes of her home-court advantage. Trump also had the endorsements of local South Carolina GOP chapters, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace and other lawmakers in the state. Trump also has a healthy track record in the Palmetto State, having won the GOP primary in 2016 and taking 55% of the votes in 2020 against Joe Biden. Where are the candidates on South Carolina's top issues? South Carolinians had immigration and the economy top of mind as they cast their ballots, mirroring sentiments nationwide. According to the February USA Today/Suffolk University poll, 42% of likely South Carolina GOP voters viewed immigration as the most important issue, while 26% prioritize the economy.

Feb 06 2024,White House says immigration deal pits Border Patrol against Trump,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/2839597/white-house-immigration-deal-border-patrol-trump,"The White House is pressing Congress to pass the bipartisan border deal, saying it will secure the border and prevent fentanyl from reaching the United States.

“The bipartisan border security deal is the toughest, fairest, and most significant legislation to secure the border in decades,” Biden administration spokesman Andrew Bates wrote in a Tuesday memo. “And it has now earned a wide range of support, from the Border Patrol Union to the Chamber of Commerce.”

The Border Patrol union has endorsed the deal, but it faces considerable opposition from Republicans in both chambers of Congress. The top four House GOP members have said the deal fails in every policy area.

Bates’s memo accuses the GOP, and specifically House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), of hypocrisy.

“President Biden and Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have delivered what Speaker Johnson claimed he supported for months and even years: a bipartisan bill that includes ‘statutory reforms designed to restore operational control at our southern border,'” Bates wrote.

The memo lists out the deal’s benefits, including more than 1,500 new border personnel, 1,200 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel, 100 machines designed to detect fentanyl, and 4,300 asylum officers to process claims.

“But suddenly, Speaker Johnson is tying himself in knots manufacturing excuses to oppose all of those benefits,” Bates said.

He also said failure to pass the bill would signal that the GOP is more beholden to the wishes of former President Donald Trump than to border security.

“Will House Republicans say ‘yes’ to more law enforcement like the Border Patrol, whose union supports the bipartisan deal,” the memo reads, “or will they instead say ‘yes’ to more fentanyl and to Donald Trump’s insistence that border security be delayed in the name of politics?”

President Joe Biden is scheduled to make a speech about the matter before noon Tuesday."
Feb 01 2024,House Approves Bill to Tighten Immigration Policies for Noncitizen DUI Offenders,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/house-approves-bill-to-tighten-immigration-policies-for-noncitizen-dui-offenders-5578031,"The legislation provides authorities with an additional tool to protect communities from dangerous criminal aliens.

The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a measure to make it easier to deport or prohibit noncitizens convicted of drunk driving from receiving citizenship.

With the support of all 215 Republicans and 59 Democrats, the measure was approved by a vote of 274 to 150 on Feb. 1, moving forward to the Senate for approval.

DUI convictions are already subject to deportation in certain circumstances, and individuals aiming to obtain residency are currently made aware of the fact that such a conviction can impede the process of reestablishing their status.

“Every day in the United States, around 37 people die due to a drunk driver – that’s one person every 39 minutes. Drunk driving is a dangerous crime that not only puts the driver at risk, but everyone else on the road,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) wrote in a Jan. 28 note previewing the bill.

By explicitly defining DUI convictions as grounds for inadmissibility and removability, the legislation provides authorities with an additional tool to protect communities from dangerous criminal aliens. The bill aims to prevent further tragedies while holding individuals accountable for their actions.

The “ Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act “ addresses what Republicans referenced as the urgent need to safeguard American lives and prevent DUI-related accidents from causing further harm. It is expected to undergo further consideration in the Senate to become law and contribute to enhancing public safety across the United States.

However, the House-passed legislation addresses discrepancies between state and federal legislation that permit prior DUI convictions to be disregarded in immigration proceedings.

Additionally, it renders all misdemeanor DUI offenses grounds for deportation and inadmissibility for status adjustments.

If passed further, the legislation would also likely affect individuals who are already in the United States and are attempting to modify their status.

“With the seriousness of the crime and the potential deadly consequences, you would think that if an illegal immigrant was caught driving under the influence, they would be deported and barred from reentering the country – unfortunately, however, that is not always the case,” Mr. Scalise went on in his preview.

The criteria do not restrict the deportation of DUI offenders, but they do urge police to prioritize individuals who pose a danger to the public. The program also gives priority to deporting those who are seen as a danger to the nation’s or the border’s security.

Aside from the length of time since the crime, the seriousness of the crime, including any violent elements, and any “evidence of rehabilitation,” the paper also instructs authorities to take these factors into account when deciding whether to deport an individual.

According to the legislation, in 2021, alcohol-impaired fatalities surged by 14 percent, leading to 10,850 deaths on average each year between 2012 and 2021. Drunk drivers are involved in 31 percent of all crash deaths nationwide, posing a substantial threat to public safety.

Criminal and illegal aliens have not been exempt from these preventable accidents, and recent data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) revealed that in fiscal year 2018, ICE arrested aliens with criminal histories that included 80,730 DUI-related charges and convictions.

In fiscal year 2019, this number remained alarmingly high at 74,523. However, in fiscal year 2022, under a perceived relaxation of immigration enforcement, the number plummeted to 26,238, allowing more illegal aliens with DUI-related charges and convictions to potentially re-offend.

“It’s common sense: Congress should uphold the rule of law and deport illegal immigrants who threaten the safety of our communities and pose a dangerous risk on the roads,” Mr. Scalise went on in his preview. “American families deserve our protection, and it’s our responsibility to deport and bar these migrants to keep our streets safe.”"

Axios reported on Monday that Harris and her aides made it clear early on that her responsibilities started and ended with working on root causes and factors driving immigration from countries like Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, known as the Northern Triangle.

President Biden tasked Harris to take on the root causes of the border crisis.

""She's been at best ineffective, and at worst sporadically engaged and not seeing it was her responsibility. It's an opportunity for her, and she didn't fill the breach,"" a former Biden administration official told the media outlet.

HIGH MIGRANT NUMBERS BREAK MULTIPLE RECORDS IN NEW BLOW TO BIDEN BORDER STRATEGY

Harris blamed Republicans for playing politics with regard to the crisis at the border during a recent interview with Katie Couric.

""Early on, I know you were tasked with understanding the root causes of the immigration crisis, but you’re not in charge of the border, which I think is important to point out,"" Couric said.

Axios also highlighted turmoil within the Biden administration's handling of the border crisis. The Department of Homeland Security imposed a 100-day pause on deportations on Biden's first day in office, and the outlet reported DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas opposed the pause at the time.

Harris also clashed with former Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice, according to Axios, but both denied the reporting.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ADMITS BORDER ISN'T ‘SECURE’ AFTER CLAIMING FOR YEARS IMMIGRATION WAS NOT A CRISIS

""Rice appeared to others to take pride in being more informed on the border than Harris,"" Axios reported. ""Some Harris aides found Rice to be disrespectful toward the vice president and dismissively referred to the former UN ambassador as just a ‘staffer.’""

Rice also called Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra a ""bi--- a--"" over ""what was seen as his reluctance to find more space in child migrant shelters,"" according to the outlet.

Biden was also critical of his aides over the crisis in January 2023, when he paid a visit to the southern border. The report notes the president ""lit into his team,"" former Deputy Chief of Staff Jen O'Malley Dillon and Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall, on Air Force One.

A South Dakota tribe has banned Republican Gov.

“Due to the safety of the Oyate, effective immediately, you are hereby Banished from the homelands of the Oglala Sioux Tribe!” Tribe President Frank Star Comes Out said in a Friday statement addressed to Noem. “Oyate” is a word for people or nation.

Star Comes Out accused Noem of trying to use the border issue to help get former President Donald Trump re-elected and boost her chances of becoming his running mate.

Many of those arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border are Indigenous people from places like El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico who come “in search of jobs and a better life,” the tribal leader added.

“They don’t need to be put in cages, separated from their children like during the Trump Administration, or be cut up by razor wire furnished by, of all places, South Dakota,” he said.

Star Comes Out also addressed Noem’s remarks in the speech to lawmakers Wednesday in which she said a gang calling itself the Ghost Dancers is murdering people on the Pine Ridge Reservation and is affiliated with border-crossing cartels that use South Dakota reservations to spread drugs throughout the Midwest.

Star Comes Out said he took deep offense at her reference, saying the Ghost Dance is one of the Oglala Sioux’s “most sacred ceremonies,” “was used with blatant disrespect and is insulting to our Oyate.”

He added that the tribe is a sovereign nation and does not belong to the state of South Dakota.

Noem responded Saturday in a statement, saying, “It is unfortunate that President (Star) Comes Out chose to bring politics into a discussion regarding the effects of our federal government’s failure to enforce federal laws at the southern border and on tribal lands. My focus continues to be on working together to solve those problems.”

“As I told bipartisan Native American legislators earlier this week, ‘I am not the one with a stiff arm, here. You can’t build relationships if you don’t spend time together,’” she added. “I stand ready to work with any of our state’s Native American tribes to build such a relationship.”

In November, Star Comes Out declared a state of emergency on the Pine Ridge Reservation due to increasing crime. A judge ruled last year that the federal government has a treaty duty to support law enforcement on the reservation, but he declined to rule on the funding level the tribe sought.

Noem has deployed National Guard troops to the Mexican border three times, as have some other Republican governors.

In 2021 she drew criticism for accepting a $1 million donation from a Republican donor to help cover the cost of a two-month deployment of 48 troops there."

Conservative media have continued to rail against Republican supporters of the bill, suggesting that such lawmakers are betraying their party and constituents and that border protections are too weak to be effective."
Feb 02 2024,Immigration negotiators say they have a deal as Senate eyes votes next week,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/immigration-negotiators-say-deal-senate-eyes-votes-week-rcna132911,"WASHINGTON — Key Senate negotiators say they’ve struck a tentative deal to enact tougher U.S. immigration and asylum laws, marking a significant breakthrough on a politically explosive issue as the 2024 election year gets underway.

But the pact is in jeopardy even before senators release the text of the bill, which they’re hoping to do in the coming days in anticipation of voting on it beginning next week.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday that senators plan to release the “full text” of the immigration package, which will include aid funding for Ukraine and Israel, “as early as tomorrow” and “no later than Sunday.”

“That will give members plenty of time to read the bill before voting,” he said, adding he plans to hold the first procedural vote on the package “no later than Wednesday.”

The tentative agreement, struck by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., represents an ambitious effort to tackle a problem that has bedeviled Congress for decades — in the middle of an election year.

“For all intents and purposes, we have an agreement,” Murphy said.

The measure faces uncertainty in the Senate, pushback from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a steady bombardment of opposition from likely GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump that is endangering Republican support. Some in the party worry that it could give President Joe Biden a victory on a political vulnerability in his 2024 re-election bid.

“I feel like the guy standing in the middle of the field in a thunderstorm holding up the metal stick currently,” Lankford said, adding that process has been “really intense.”

Lankford maintained that he had kept Johnson informed of the scope and details of the border bill throughout the process, keeping the speaker’s staff in the loop throughout the final stages.

But Johnson’s office pushed back on Lankford’s characterization of the discussions, telling NBC News in a statement: “Senator Lankford nor his office has never provided Speaker Johnson’s office with proposed legislative text or a written description of the new expulsion authority. They have described it in conversation with less detail than what is available in published news reports.”

The deal would take a three-pronged approach to mitigating the chaos at the border. First, it would limit options for people outside the U.S. to pursue asylum. Second, it would raise the standard for people at the border to qualify for asylum. Third, it would speed up processing of claims, cut off avenues for appeal if they are rejected, and end “catch and release” by enforcing government monitoring of migrants throughout the process.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he’s favorably inclined to support it but said the prospects of getting a majority of the Senate GOP on board is “declining,” as some senators prefer not to “walk the plank” for a complicated bill if it is unlikely to clear the House.

“The path is getting narrower to get to 25,” Cramer said.

The bill needs 60 votes to break a filibuster in the Senate. But Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., a proponent of the deal, said it’s unlikely to move forward without the support of at least half the Republican caucus, or 25 senators.

One holdup to releasing the text is securing enough funding to implement the policy changes.

“I’m getting worried,” Murphy told reporters on Thursday. “Republicans have to be serious about funding the deal that we have made. Our policy deal is done but it requires the bill to fund the changes that Republicans asked for.”

Another reason for the delay is that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has been speaking to his members to make sure there’s enough support when the bill is released, according to a source with knowledge of the talks, so that it won’t have to be changed after the fact to accommodate conservative concerns. (McConnell’s office declined to comment.)

Further complicating matters, House Republicans are preparing to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, accusing him of refusing to enforce immigration laws even as he has met with the Senate negotiators to discuss the new deal.

In the meantime, Senate negotiators have been playing whack-a-mole with a steady stream of claims about the contents of the bill on conservative media, which have sparked a backlash based on assertions the senators insist are inaccurate.

In a rare gaggle with reporters on Wednesday, Sinema defended the emerging deal and rebuked Republican “misrepresentation” of the bill, calling comments made by hard-liners — including Johnson as recently as Wednesday — “factually incorrect.”

“The rumors that are swirling about what this legislation does are wrong,” she said. “Our bill ends ‘catch and release.’ It ensures that the government both has the power and must close down the border during times when our system is overwhelmed. And it creates new structures to ensure that folks who do not qualify for asylum cannot enter the country and stay here.”

The pressure placed on Senate Republicans by Trump and Johnson, backed by a contingent of hard-right senators, could torch the deal and quash hopes of approving critical aid to Ukraine, Israel and Gaza refugees. It was the focal point of an extensive discussion among Senate Republicans during a closed-door lunch on Wednesday, but no concrete decisions were made, according to multiple Senators leaving the meeting.

“We had a lot of discussion, obviously about the border around here, but it’s important to focus on the other rationale for the supplemental: We’ve got two friends in the middle of a huge fight, Israel, Ukraine. They need help,” McConnell, a staunch supporter of helping Ukraine fend off Russia, told reporters on Wednesday.

“And hopefully,” McConnell said, “we can work this border issue out in a way that is satisfactory but there’s bipartisan support here in the Senate for both Israel and Ukraine. And hopefully, at some point, we’ll get them the help that they need.”

The negotiations have occurred in fits and starts, collapsing around Thanksgiving before restarting as Democrats decided they were willing to pay a price to get Ukraine aid.

They were also complicated by Democrats’ concerns that new executive powers without constraints could be abused by Trump or a future president like him. It’s why negotiators put a provision in the legislation that would cap the number of days the border could be shut down under a new authority that would close the border when encounters exceed a daily average of 5,000.

The legislation is likely to lose the votes of a contingent of progressive and Congressional Hispanic Caucus members, who argue that Democrats are conceding too much to the GOP without securing their priorities, such as normalizing the status of young “Dreamers” who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.

The bill would significantly change the way migrants are “paroled” at the border, effectively ending the status quo. “It was troubling to me that it was even on the table,” said a senior member of the Hispanic Caucus.

But many Democrats are supportive of tightening immigration laws, and the aid to Ukraine is an added incentive to get them on board. The main obstacle to turning the deal into law is conservative blowback.

“Some people say I want you to do it differently. And my statement is: Great, go jump in and negotiate it,” Lankford said. “If we can actually make that law rather than just a press conference, please go negotiate it. My job is to go make law.”"
Feb 06 2024,Immigration hawks warn Congress that Senate deal will handcuff future administrations on securing border,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/immigration-hawks-warn-congress-senate-deal-handcuff-future-administrations-securing-border,"FIRST ON FOX: A coalition of hawkish immigration groups is warning congressional leaders that a border deal released this week by the Senate as part of a supplemental spending bill to fund Ukraine and Israel would limit the ability of future administrations to tackle illegal immigration.

""The legislative text confirms our worst suspicions: if enacted, the bill would codify the border crisis and severely limit any future enforcement-minded administration from securing the border,"" the groups, led by the Heritage Foundation, said in a letter to congressional leaders.

Senate negotiators released the $118 billion supplemental spending deal late Sunday, which includes funding for Ukraine, Israel and $20 billion in funding for border and immigration-related matters.

IMMIGRATION ACTIVISTS, LIBERAL SENATE DEMS TRASH BORDER DEAL OVER LACK OF AMNESTY FOR ILLEGALS

It includes a new temporary emergency border authority to mandate Title 42-style expulsions of migrants when migration levels exceed 5,000 a day over a seven-day rolling average, and it narrows asylum eligibility while expediting the process, provides additional work permits for asylum seekers and funds a massive increase in staffing for Customs and Border Protection and asylum officers.

It also increases temporary visas and green cards, while establishing an expedited pathway for Afghans who were evacuated to the U.S. The legislation also includes $1.4 billion in FEMA funding for non-governmental organizations and cities to help settle migrants and $650 million to build and reinforce the border wall. It will also provide $450 million to countries to help them remove and integrate illegal immigrants back into their countries.

""The bipartisan agreement in the Senate is tough, fair, and takes meaningful steps to address the challenges our country faces after decades of Congressional inaction,"" Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement.

GOP SENATORS DEMAND ‘ADEQUATE TIME’ TO REVIEW BORDER SECURITY BILL

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., an author of the package, said this week that the bar on asylum eligibility would go a long way to fixing the crisis and change the operating stance at the border.

""New bars to asylum eligibility will stop the criminal cartels from exploiting our currently weak immigration laws. The bill also has new emergency authorities to shut down the border when the border is overrun, new hiring authorities to quickly increase officers, and new hearing authorities to quickly apply consequences for illegal crossings,"" he said. ""It changes our border from catch and release to detain and deport.""

However, the bill has faced a firestorm of opposition from the right who remain unconvinced, and the coalition of hawkish groups say that it does not do enough to end catch-and-release and argues it replaces ""current statutory monitoring with a mass release program of weaker discretionary ‘monitoring’"" while failing to close loopholes for children to be ""recycled"" by cartels.

5 KEY DETAILS IN CONTROVERSIAL SENATE BORDER DEAL

""The advertised reform of standards in the asylum process would not significantly prevent asylum fraud, and when coupled with the supercharged catch-and-release, would only continue the flood of asylum abuse as a means of entry into the U.S.,"" they said.

""Moreover, the bill would expand funding to fund sanctuary cities and the non-governmental organization's secretive infrastructure that processes, transports, and provides services for illegal aliens in the United States,"" they added.

Groups on the letter include the American First Policy Institute, Numbers USA, Border 911, the Immigration Accountability Project, the Federation for American Immigration Reform and Citizens for Renewing America. It also includes former Trump officials including former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan, former Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott, former acting ICE Director Thomas Homan, former ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau and former Office of Management and Budget Director Ross Vought.

The coalition of groups has previously shared the demand by Republicans in the House that the House border bill passed last year — H.R. 2 — must be included as part of any supplemental spending agreement. They have argued that anything that falls short of that is insufficient at a time of a historic border crisis.

They also argue that President Biden currently has the authority to end the border crisis without legislation, but have argued in favor of H.R. 2 in order to ""close the loopholes that have been weaponized, not because new authorities to secure the border are needed.""

As it stands, they warn the package will turn the border crisis into a ""political talking point.""

""The only measure of the effectiveness of border security policy is whether it actually secures the border. This legislative package does not secure the border, and it will severely curtail the ability of future administrations to do so,"" they said."
Jan 28 2024,Oklahoma Republicans End Support for Lankford over Plan to Expand Immigration,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/28/oklahoma-republican-party-ends-all-support-sen-james-lankford-senate-deal-expand-immigration,"The Oklahoma Republican Party is ceasing “all support” for Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) as he leads negotiations with other Republicans and Democrats for a Senate deal that would expand illegal and legal immigration to the United States.

As Breitbart News has detailed, Lankford is negotiating the deal alongside other Republicans such as Thom Tillis (R-NC) and John Thune (R-SD) with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and others.

RELATED VIDEO — Dem KC Mayor: Migrant Surge Is Helping Cause Homelessness, Which Hasn’t Gone Down Post-COVID:

The deal would expand legal immigration levels by 50,000 green cards annually even as the U.S. already admits about a million legal immigrants a year with the nation’s foreign-born population set to surpass 50 million this year — the first time in American history.

Likewise, the deal would allow up to 35,000 illegal aliens to arrive at the U.S.-Mexico border every week before requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to impose border controls. Also in the deal, illegal aliens would get expedited work permits to take American jobs and Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs) would be provided taxpayer-funded lawyers.

Late last week, members of the Oklahoma Republican Party [OKGOP] State Committee adopted a resolution to condemn and censure Lankford for his work on the deal.

“Be it resolved that the OKGOP strongly condemns Senator James Lankford, if and to the extent that he continues these actions, and calls upon him to cease and desist jeopardizing the security and liberty of the people of Oklahoma and of these United States,” the resolution reads:

Be it resolved that until Senator Lankford ceases from these actions, the Oklahoma Republican Party will cease all support for him. [Emphasis added]

The OKGOP members make it clear in their resolution that the party’s platform supports “limited legal immigration” to the U.S. that cuts existing annual admissions “to prevent an adverse effect on our national security, wages, housing, environment, medical care, or schools.”

“We oppose a ‘path to citizenship’ that would grant citizenship to illegal aliens,” the OKGOP members noted, adding that “authorizing several thousand people to invade our borders before any action can be taken is contrary to the oath that Senator Lankford took to the Constitution and therefore outside of the area that he is authorized to negotiate on.”

While Republicans condemn the deal, President Joe Biden has announced his endorsement.

“For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it. If you’re serious about the border crisis, pass a bipartisan bill and I will sign it,” Biden wrote in a statement.

Jan 28 2024,Oklahoma Republicans Wheel on Senator Lankford for Shepherding Immigration Reform Deal,The New York Sun,right,https://nysun.com/article/oklahoma-republicans-wheel-on-senator-lankford-for-shepherding-immigration-reform-deal,"A former state Republican Party chairman says the anti-Lankford resolution is not official, however, and violates party rules.

A faction of the Oklahoma state Republican Party has attempted to censure Senator Lankford because of his involvement in the bipartisan immigration reform and border security bill currently being negotiated in the Senate. Some state party committee members say the vote was not legitimate because a full meeting was not called.

“The OKGOP strongly condemns Senator James Lankford … and calls upon him to cease and desist jeopardizing the security and

liberty of the people of Oklahoma and of these United States,” the resolution states. “Until Senator Lankford ceases from these actions the Oklahoma Republican Party will cease all support for him.”

The deal that the senator is working on with a Democrat, Senator Murphy, and an independent, Senator Sinema, will reportedly permit the entry of up to 5,000 migrants per day. It would also include work permits for migrants who cross the border, an increased number of visas available to the families of high-skilled laborers, and an increase in the number of green cards issued by 50,000 a year.

The deal would also restrict the entrance of migrants who fail to appear at a port of entry and provide taxpayer-funded legal representation for unaccompanied migrant children and mentally incompetent migrants.

The resolution accuses Mr. Lankford of “working with Democrat Senator Charles Schumer on an open border deal.” It also states that “playing fast and loose with Democrats on our border policy not only disenfranchises legal immigrants seeking citizenship but it also puts the safety and security of Americans in great danger.”

Mr. Lankford responded to the resolution on Saturday night, simply writing on X: “Border security is national security.”

Some members of the Oklahoma state party say the resolution carries no weight because it was the vice chairman — not the chairman — who called the meeting and held the vote without the full committee present.

A former chairman of the state party, Anthony Ferate, said it was an “extreme” minority that moved forward with the resolution against party rules.

“Today an extreme faction of the @officialOKGOP held a meeting without providing an official call to all members of the State Committee, including me, to attack Senator @jameslankford,” Mr. Ferate wrote on X. “Any vote taken by the OKGOP today was not legitimate and definitely does not represent the voice of all Oklahoma Republicans.”

Members of the state party previously tried to censure Mr. Lankford and his former Oklahoma colleague, Senator Inhofe, after they voted to certify President Biden’s 2020 victory. That resolution ultimately failed.

Mr. Lankford’s reported immigration and border deal has been pilloried by his fellow conservatives in recent days. Speaker Johnson said Saturday that the legislation — if it even gets through the Senate — would be dead on arrival in the House, saying the president does not need new statutes to secure the border.

“The President must start by using the broad legal authority he already possesses to reclaim our nation’s sovereignty and end the mass release of illegal aliens into our country,” the speaker said. “The Senate’s pending proposal would expressly allow as many as 150,000 illegal crossings each month (1.8 million per year) before any new ‘shutdown’ authority could be used. At that point, America will have already been surrendered.”"
Jan 16 2024,"Trump's Iowa Blowout Fueled by Immigration, Economic Crises",The New York Sun,right,https://nysun.com/article/trumps-iowa-blowout-fueled-by-immigration-economic-crises,"President Trump’s historic blowout in last night’s Iowa caucuses outdid all expectations, and gives him tremendous momentum going into the New Hampshire primary a week from today.

His well-managed campaign put together a superb ground-game, producing 51 percent and winning 98 of 99 counties — losing the 99th by one vote.

Importantly, Fox’s Voter Analysis showed the two top issues for Iowans were the illegal immigration crisis — for 41 percent — and the economy, for 33 percent. This was President Trump’s bread and butter.

As I have said many times, he is running an issues campaign, and it worked spectacularly last night in Iowa.

Actually, the illegal immigration catastrophe was the number one issue for Caucus goers, and here’s what the President said in his speech last night:

“We’re going to seal up the border because right now we have an invasion and we have an invasion of millions and millions of people that are coming into our country. I can’t imagine why they think that’s a good thing. It’s a very bad thing.”

He added: “And we’re going to have to deport this. We’re going to have to have a deportation level that we haven’t seen in this country for a long time since Dwight Eisenhower actually.”

This is a signature Trump issue. Frankly, going all the way back to 2015 when he first announced his candidacy. It’s a problem he solved, but it’s a problem President Biden re-created.

Secondly: drill, baby, drill, liquid gold, tax cuts, and a return to prosperity — another signature Trump issue. Take a listen to what he said last evening: “And now we’re a nation in decline. We are going to turn it around so fast. It’s going to happen so fast. We’re going to drill. We’re going to make great — we have great wealth — we’re going to drill.”

He added: “We’re going to use that money to lower your taxes even further. We gave you the biggest tax cut in history, and we’re going to lower them further and we’re also going to pay off the national debt. It’s about time.”

And, importantly, the former president held out olive branches to Governor DeSantis and Ambassador Nikki Haley, as he congratulated their efforts and called for unity.

This was exactly the right approach and tone. “I want to congratulate Ron and Nikki for having a good a good time together,” he said. “We’re all having a good time together. And I think they both actually did very well.”

Mr Trump added: “I also want to congratulate Vivek, because he did a hell of a job. He came from zero and he’s got a big percent, probably 8 percent, almost 8 percent. And that’s an amazing job. They all did. They’re very smart, very smart people, very capable people.”

The key, of course, is to defeat Mr. Biden and his open border catastrophe, his failed Bidenomics, his socialist Green New Deal, and his collapsing foreign policy.

The primaries will go on for a while, though Mr. Trump will be a sure winner. Hopefully, the avalanche of endorsements — including Mr. Ramaswamy and senators, governors, and House members too numerous to count — will help persuade Mr. DeSantis and Mrs. Haley to join the unity ticket behind Mr. Trump before long.

One other signature Trump theme showed up in last night’s Voter Analysis. Iowa Republicans who want total change in how America is run voted overwhelmingly — by 69 percent — for Mr. Trump.

This is the Trumpian mantra: “Drain the Swamp.” Whether a two-tiered election-interfering justice department, the FBI, the CIA, corrupt prosecutors all across the country, a lack of law and order, parental rights in the classroom, free speech, tenured civil servants, woke DEI rather than merit — America under Mr. Biden has veered sharply in the wrong direction.

Mr. Trump believes he can fix a very broken system. So did the voters of Iowa. And they won’t be the last. It’s history in the making.

Jan 27 2024,Biden Endorses Senate Deal to Expand Immigration: 'I Will Sign It',Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/27/joe-biden-endorses-senate-deal-expand-immigration-i-will-sign-it,"President Joe Biden has endorsed a Senate deal to massively expand overall immigration to the United States negotiated by Sens. James Lankford (R-OK) and Chris Murphy (D-CT) among others, saying he “will sign it” if it is passed through Congress.

Lankford and Murphy have negotiated a deal to expand legal immigration levels by an additional 50,000 green cards annually, expedite work permits for illegal aliens released into the nation’s interior, provide taxpayer-funded lawyers to Unaccompanied Alien Children (UACs), and allow up to 35,000 illegal aliens to arrive at the border every week before imposing border controls, among other things.

Biden announced his endorsement of the deal late Friday evening.

“Securing the border through these negotiations is a win for America. For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it. If you’re serious about the border crisis, pass a bipartisan bill and I will sign it,” Biden said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has backed away from the deal, and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has told colleagues that the deal is “dead on arrival” in the House.

Former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican presidential nominee, has helped expose the deal’s details to hugely expand overall immigration to the United States — publicly and privately urging Senate Republicans to oppose the effort.

Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mitt Romney (R-UT), John Thune (R-SD), and Todd Young (R-IN) have complained that Trump’s influence has made the deal toxic for other Republicans to sign on to.

Already, Biden’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is estimated to have welcomed 6.2 million illegal aliens to the U.S. since late January 2021 thanks to the agency’s expansive Catch and Release network.

Feb 05 2024,$340 Million in Federal COVID Aid Was Turned Into Cash Transfers Subsidizing Illegal Immigration,Western Journal,not-yet-rated,https://westernjournal.com/new-report-shows-340-million-federal-covid-relief-turned-cash-transfers-subsidizing-illegal-immigration,"A shocking new report found that hundreds of millions of our tax dollars earmarked to help struggling Americans through the COVID-19 pandemic were instead handed out to illegal aliens in Washington state.

$340 million was taken out of the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund — a federal aid program — and given to illegals in the form of $1,000 checks, according to a review of the spending by the Economic Policy Innovation Center.

Or perhaps it isn’t so shocking considering that the West Coast is ruled by left-wing Democrats.

Washington received $4.4 billion in total SLFRF funding, according to Fox News, but set aside the $340 million so that illegals could dip their hands into the funds despite being ineligible to receive federal COVID aid.

A report released by state officials last year noted that the cash transfer to the “Immigrant Relief Fund” was approved by the Washington state Legislature in April 2021 to provide “another round of funding for undocumented Washingtonians.”

In essence, the Democrat-dominated state Legislature did an end-run around the rules preventing illegals from getting federal COVID relief funds meant for actual Americans.

The transfer was also approved by the Biden administration, according to EPIC.

“This means the Biden Administration directly subsidized ‘undocumented’ immigration under the guise of COVID-19 pandemic relief,” the organization’s report explained.

Washington enacted a similarly wasteful scheme as the Trump presidency wound down by carving out $128 million for the IRF, handing out $1,000 checks to 122,000 illegal aliens.

Was this an appropriate use of federal COVID funds? Yes No

Furthermore, state Democrats engineered the “relief” program to make sure it would not negatively impact a recipient’s application for a green card.

“Even though this check is public assistance, because it is being funneled through a so-called COVID program, it would not constitute welfare in such a way that would prevent someone from receiving a permanent resident card,” EPIC wrote in its report.

The IRF has stopped accepting applications for new payouts, “indicating that the project fund is fully exhausted,” EPIC noted.

The group found similar programs shifting federal pandemic relief funding to illegals in Arizona, Illinois, Texas and other states.

“The [Biden] administration has been actively encouraging illegal immigration by using COVID money from the SLFRF to provide cash assistance, housing, legal aid, and other benefits to undocumented immigrants,” Paul Winfree, president and CEO of EPIC, told Fox.

Winfree added that there is still $120 billion in the SLFRF, much of which will no doubt go toward the factors drawing illegals to this country like bugs to a glowing porch light.

Of course, millions of indigent, jobless and penniless people will flock here if Democrats are going to give them free housing, medical care, education, transportation, legal services and fistfuls of money.

Sadly, this waste is typical of state and federal “pandemic relief” programs, which funneled billions of dollars to left-wing wish list items that had nothing to do with COVID.

In Washington alone, hundreds of millions went to illegals when Americans were struggling to make ends meet because state officials had shut down their jobs and schools.

For Democrats, it truly is America last.

A Note from Our Deputy Managing Editor: “We don’t even know if an election will be held in 2024.” Those 12 words have been stuck in my head since I first read them. Former Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn recently made that comment to Floyd Brown, founder of The Western Journal. And if the leftists and the elites get their way, that’s exactly what will happen — no real election, no real choice for the Electoral College, and no real say for the American people.

Dec 29 2023,Fact-Checking Trump’s Recent Immigration Claims,New York Times Fact Check,left,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/24/us/politics/trump-immigration-fact-check.html,"Former President Donald J. Trump has drawn widespread censure after reprising a line that casts undocumented immigrants as “poisoning the blood of our country.”

The remark underscored Mr. Trump’s hard-line approach to immigration, which has been central to his platform since he made his first bid for president in 2015. If elected again, he has vowed to carry out mass deportations and enact other strict policies.

He and his Republican rivals have pointed to the surge of migrants at the southern border to make their political case. Some Democrats, too, have been critical of the Biden administration’s approach toward immigration.

But even with legitimate lines of attack, Mr. Trump has at times turned to baseless and misleading claims during rallies in recent months."

Dec 27 2023,Want to Solve the Border Crisis? Legalize Immigration.,Daily Beast,left,https://www.thedailybeast.com/want-to-solve-the-border-crisis-legalize-immigration,"Republicans won’t pass aid to Ukraine without a so-called “border deal,” and although Democrats don’t agree on how to do it, they have already agreed with the Republicans’ restrictionist goal to let fewer people into America. But nearly everything that politicians now use to justify immigration restriction can be traced to the restrictionist policies already in force.

In other words, immigration restrictionists create the problems and then demand ever more restrictions to fix them. Lather, rinse, repeat.

The main problem they assert is simply that people keep entering the country illegally. An inquisitive person might ask: Why don’t they come legally?

The answer is quite simple: Legal immigration is impossible for them.

There is no path, other than requesting asylum at the border, that is available to the people who are coming up through Mexico to the United States. If ending illegal immigration was the goal, the government could simply let them come legally.

But that’s not the goal. Politicians are saying that the country is “overwhelmed” and can’t handle any more immigrants, legal or otherwise. What nonsense.

The United States has among the lowest population densities of any country in the world, and U.S. population growth in the 2020s has never been lower. America needs people to fill its nearly nine million open jobs and support its growing retiree population.

Immigrants aren’t the problem. The politicians are the problem.

Border communities are declaring “states of emergency” because they have so many immigrants sleeping on their streets. It’s a real problem, but why are they sleeping on their streets? Because politicians won’t let them enter legally and line up transportation in advance, so when Border Patrol unexpectedly releases them, they sleep next to bus depots waiting for the next bus out of town.

Rural border hospitals are begging Congress for bailouts. But many migrants end up needing medical care because Border Patrol intentionally uses walls to direct them to cross through deserts or across rivers where they can become dehydrated or drown. The wall has only added to the chaos with record numbers falling from the wall and severely injuring themselves.

Don’t blame the immigrant risk-takers—nah, they’d happily enter legally. Blame the politicians who want immigrants to have to jump walls to come.

What about the rise of migrant homelessness in cities across the United States? Surely that proves that we need restriction? Not at all. These immigrants desperately want to work to support themselves, but Biden officials are too scared to let them do so legally because then more will come.

Our political class is choosing to create a homeless crisis, which then creates the justification for more restrictions at the border.

Freeing up Border Patrol would allow it to target criminals who cross the border. But politicians are explicitly not focused on the criminals. They want to keep out those immigrants who the Border Patrol screens and releases, not those who avoid arrests.

Even if more restriction isn’t needed, couldn’t it fix the problems? No, it would exacerbate the crisis.

Let’s review what’s on the table. House Republicans want to ban asylum completely at the southwest border and to send a lot more people to Mexico. But we just lived through this exact combination of policies under “Title 42” health authority and it was a disaster. More people tried to enter, and more importantly, more people tried to sneak past Border Patrol leading to record numbers of deadly chases.

With no reason to turn themselves in, record numbers tried to evade detection and enter without being screened by Border Patrol—that’s the opposite of increasing “security.”

House and Senate Republicans also insist on banning the only legal ways to enter the country for these people by restricting the president’s authority to “parole” them in at ports of entry. Biden is already capping his use of this authority at such a low level that illegal immigration is continuing anyway, but getting rid of it altogether would unleash a deluge of people who would have otherwise entered “the right way.”

When restrictionists get their way and all this chaos predictably plays out, they’ll go back in their tool bag for—you guessed it—more chaos-inducing restrictions! There’s a better way. Legalize immigration.

Let people come and work legally and contribute to this great country, just as immigrants have for centuries. That’s the border plan of America’s founders. It was our tradition for most of our history.

Feb 03 2024,Elon Musk Says ‘Outrageous’ Biden Plan on Illegal Immigration Is to Impose ’One-Party' Rule in America,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/elon-musk-says-outrageous-biden-plan-on-illegal-immigration-is-to-impose-one-party-rule-in-america-5579810,"Elon Musk claims President Biden aims to get as many illegal immigrants into the US as possible, then legalize them for a lasting Democrat majority.

Elon Musk is alleging that President Joe Biden’s overarching strategy on the border since he took office is to let in as many illegal immigrants as possible and then legalize them by legislative reform so as to secure a permanent Democrat majority and rule the country as a “one-party state.”

Mr. Musk laid out the case for this claim in a Feb. 2 post on X , in which the tech entrepreneur offered a look back at President Biden’s first action after assuming office on Jan. 20, 2021, which Mr. Musk said was a “simple, yet effective” strategy to keep Democrats in power forever.

On President Joe Biden’s first day in office, he proposed the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which immediately sparked uproar over provisions like pathways to citizenship for some 11 million illegal immigrants.

The measure, introduced in the House of Representatives but died with the end of the 117th Congress, was revived in a somewhat modified form in May 2023 as the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2023, which remains stuck in Committee.

Both prior and current versions of President Biden’s immigration reform bill propose pathways to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants, including DREAMers and farm workers.

But as the Biden administration’s legislative efforts to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants have remained in limbo amid Republican opposition, the number of illegal border crossings under President Biden’s watch has soared to record highs. ‘Outrageous’ Republicans and others have accused the Biden administration of being intentionally lax on border security, even precisely so as to let in more illegal immigrants for political benefit.

President Biden and members of his administration have rejected this claim, accusing Republicans of playing politics with the border crisis and of cynically denying the administration the opportunity of meaningful immigration reform by legislative means.

Mr. Musk, who has become an increasingly vocal critic of the Biden administration’s handling of the illegal immigration crisis, laid out in his post on X what he says is President Biden’s nefarious strategy on the border.

“Biden’s strategy is very simple,” Mr. Musk wrote.

First, “get as many illegals in the country as possible,” and second, “legalize them to create a permanent majority—a one-party state,” he continued.

“That is why they are encouraging so much illegal immigration. Simple, yet effective,” he wrote.

Mr. Musk continued in a follow-up post by saying that the strategy he described earlier “explains why there are so few deportations, as every deportation is a lost vote.”

“As happened this week, you can literally assault police officers in broad daylight in New York, be released with no bail, give everyone the finger and *still* not be deported,” he wrote.

“Outrageous,” he charged.

‘Slow to Figure It Out’ Among the many reactions to Mr. Musk’s post was Among the many reactions to Mr. Musk’s post was the argument that President Biden has the power to stop the flow of illegal immigration across the border, but chooses not to, and that the record numbers of unauthorized border crossings in recent times validate what many have been alleging is a long-running Democrat scheme to expand their voter base.

“I was embarrassingly slow to figure it out,” Mr. Musk replied to the post

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Musk’s remarks.

Some commenters reacting critically to Mr. Musk’s post said that the vast majority of illegal immigrants who would be given a pathway to citizenship under President Biden’s legislative proposal are people on overstayed visas, rather than those who crossed the border illegally.

Others argued that the Biden administration is deporting more people than former President Donald Trump did when he was in power.

While it’s true that more people are being deported under the Biden administration, critics point out that it’s merely a reflection of the massive increase in the number of illegal immigrants entering the country in recent years.

Federal authorities deported over 142,000 illegal immigrants in 2023, nearly double from the year before, according to a recent report from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

But the number deported is just a fraction of the 2 million known entries reported by Border Patrol along just the U.S. southern border in 2023.

It comes as a record-breaking number of illegal immigrant encounters was logged in December, with both nationwide encounters (371,036) and those along the U.S.-Mexico border (302,034) setting new records.

The stunning numbers come amid House Republican efforts to impeach Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of the illegal immigration crisis.

Republicans have introduced two articles of impeachment against Mr. Mayorkas, accusing him of “willful and systemic refusal to comply with the law” and that he “knowingly made false statements and knowingly obstructed lawful oversight” of DHS.

In a four-page memo issued on Jan. 28, DHS responded to the impeachment articles, calling them a “distraction from other vital national security priorities and the work Congress should be doing to actually fix our broken immigration laws.”

Republicans “don’t want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it,” the DHS memo charged.

“That’s why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas,” it added.

The Biden administration has rejected allegations of mishandling border security, though the president recently admitted that the country is facing a “border crisis.”

Both President Biden and Mr. Mayorkas have variously blamed a “broken” immigration system, along with factors like crime and corruption in countries that people are fleeing from in search of a better life in the United States, and even climate change."

During a CNBC interview conducted Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon discussed the current U.S. economy and politics with the 2024 presidential election little more than nine months away.

He said that many Trump supporters are backing the former president because of his policies, not necessarily his personality.

""I wish the Democrats would think a little bit more carefully when they talk about MAGA,"" Dimon said on CNBC. ""When people say MAGA they're actually looking at people voting for Trump … and basically scapegoating them, that 'you are like him'

""I don't think they're voting for Trump because of his family values. Just take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, he was kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked, he was right about some of China. I don't like how he said things about Mexico. But he wasn't wrong about these critical issues. That's why they're voting for him.""

Dimon added that ""people should be more respectful of our fellow citizens"" and suggested to the CNBC hosts that they not just ask people whether they're supporting Trump, but also why.

""Not like it is a binary thing, you're supporting Trump or you're not supporting Trump,"" he said. ""Why [are] you supporting Trump?""

Without being asked about MAGA specifically, Dimon ripped Democrats for their attack on Trump's supporters and said President Joe Biden's anti-MAGA obsession will hurt his reelection chances.

""The Democrats have done a pretty good job with the 'deplorables,' hugging on to their Bibles and their beers and their guns,"" Dimon said. ""I mean, really? Can we just stop that stuff and grow up and treat other people with respect and listen to them a little bit.

""I think this negative talk about MAGA is going to hurt Biden's election campaign.""

Dimon said he remains cautious on the U.S. economy over the next two years because of a combination of financial and geopolitical risks, CNBC reported.

""You have all these very powerful forces that are going to be affecting us in '24 and '25,"" Dimon said.

""Ukraine, the terrorist activity in Israel [and] the Red Sea, quantitative tightening, which I still question if we understand exactly how that works.""

Quantitative tightening refers to moves by the Federal Reserve to decrease the amount of liquidity or money supply in the economy."

For U.S. carrier pilots, a vexing mission hunting down Houthi weaponry

For pilots on board the USS Eisenhower in the Red Sea, the effort to safeguard commercial shipping requires them to adapt to an unexpected mission. “We did not train to come to the South Red Sea and do what we are currently doing,” said Navy Lt. Cmdr. Travis Keating, an F/A-18 Super Hornet pilot. “When we first came out here, we had a lot of unknowns.”

More than two dozen F/A-18 Super Hornet fighters and support aircraft flew off the U.S. Navy ship to take part in a joint U.S.-U.K. mission to target Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles and drones that Houthi forces use to strike cargo ships in the Red Sea. U.S. destroyers accompanying the carrier fired Tomahawk missiles at Houthi targets on shore.

In all, the U.S. and the U.K. struck 36 Houthi targets in 13 locations in Yemen, U.S. officials said in this round of strikes. Despite the U.S.-led airstrikes, Houthi fighters in Yemen vowed to keep up their attacks in the Red Sea until Israel halts its military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Houthi attacks have forced shipping companies to divert vessels to longer, costlier routes. About 12% of global shipping passes through the waterway daily, and the strikes pose a threat to supply chains that could cause a rise in consumer prices. It remains unclear whether the stepped-up airstrikes will quell the Houthis’ attacks on commercial cargo vessels.

Senators releases draft of bipartisan bill to toughen border measures

Senators released the text of a bipartisan agreement to enact tougher immigration and asylum laws, as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer plans to vote on the package this week. The agreement — reached by Senators James Lankford, Chris Murphy, and Kyrsten Sinema — would be the most aggressive border security and migration overhaul bill in decades if it passes.

The $118 billion package includes provisions aimed at tightening an overwhelmed asylum system and reducing record high-crossings at the southern border. The bill includes a new emergency authority that would allow the Department of Homeland Security to, as President Joe Biden has put it, “shut down” the border if there are too many migrants trying to cross.

It’s still unclear if the legislation has the support to pass in the Senate, where it will need at least 60 votes to defeat a filibuster.

A severe storm system began moving into California, marking the start of what’s expected to be days’ worth of heavy rain and snow. The system, which a National Weather Service meteorologist predicted would be “potentially historic,” was forecast to bring potentially dangerous flooding, debris flows and mudslides. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a storm-related state of emergency for San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.

In higher altitudes, including the Sierra Nevada and Northern California mountain ranges, the concern is heavy snow through Tuesday. The snow is expected to produce whiteout conditions, making travel dangerous, according to the National Weather Service.

Possible hostage deal threatens to divide Israel’s right-wing Cabinet

People close to Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu say the proposed deal for a cease-fire and hostage release threatens to tear apart the country’s right-wing Cabinet. The deal pits dueling narratives of Israel’s vision of itself against each other: its pledge to its soldiers and citizens that no one will be left behind, versus Israel’s oft-stated goal that it will destroy its enemies at any cost.

The proposed framework of a deal, which was negotiated a week ago in Paris by intelligence chiefs from Israel, the U.S. and Egypt as well as Qatar’s prime minister, would include a six-week pause in the fighting in the Gaza Strip, during which the two sides would exchange Israeli hostages in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.

Politics in Brief

Congress: Sen. John Fetterman has quickly become Republicans’ favorite Democrat as he has been distancing himself from the left, saying he is “not a progressive.”

Election 2024: Democrats in Wisconsin are seeing an opportunity to gain power back from the Republicans in the battleground state. New maps are expected to eat into Republicans’ long-standing majorities and more favorable congressional lines could follow.

Republican National Committee: Donald Trump said that “there’ll probably be some changes” at the RNC when he was asked how Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel was doing.

NBC News poll: President Joe Biden’s approval rating fell to a new low, according to a new national NBC News poll. Biden trails behind former President Donald Trump on policy and personal comparisons, including by more than 20 points on which candidate would better handle the economy.

Jan 15 2024,Half of Americans agree with Trump’s ‘poisoning the blood’ immigration rhetoric,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/15/trump-poisoning-blood-immigration-polling/,"There’s always been a symbiosis between Donald Trump and right-wing rhetoric. His 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination was successful — surprisingly successful — because of his willingness to embrace arguments and assertions that were considered beyond the pale for his more traditional opponents. By picking out and then defending (to whatever extent was necessary for his audience) claims about immigrants and terrorism, among other things, he tapped into a strain of argumentation that was often kept out of sight. He helped bring the rhetoric into the mainstream.

On Sunday, CBS News presented the results of a new poll conducted by the polling firm YouGov — results that offered a stark example of this pattern, of how even extreme right-wing arguments are now barely outside the norm.

Respondents were asked by YouGov whether they agreed with Trump that immigrants entering the United States illegally had the effect of “poisoning the blood” of the country. This is not just right-wing rhetoric, mind you, but a reflection of some of the most extreme racial politics in modern history. It is an explicit depiction of immigrants as dangerous, but specifically in the context of posing a threat to national identity. It is the language of fascism.

Nearly half of Americans agreed with it.

That was largely because more than three-quarters of Republicans agreed with Trump’s framing. Fewer than half of Democrats and independents agreed.

Interestingly, when the comments weren’t attributed to Trump, support was lower. Republicans were 10 points more likely to indicate agreement with Trump when they were told it was Trump with whom they were agreeing. Democrats were slightly less likely to agree.

Overall, the difference between being told that the comments came from Trump or not being told that was not statistically significant.

There are a lot of rationalizations that are made for accepting Trump’s language, but there’s no serious question that race is central to the idea. That’s reflected elsewhere in the CBS-YouGov poll, as when people were asked to evaluate efforts to promote racial diversity and equality. Most Americans said that such efforts were about right or not going far enough.

Two-thirds of Republicans said they were going too far.

Trump’s support was initially rooted heavily in a sense among White Republicans that they were under attack. Throughout his presidency and in the years after, the role of White grievance — concern about White Americans suffering diminishing status — has become an unabashed element of Republican politics.

The CBS poll also asked Republican primary voters whether a slew of policy views would trigger more support for a particular candidate. The three that saw the highest percentages of voters indicating that they would increase a candidate’s appeal? Cutting taxes, banning surgeries to change a minor’s gender … and challenging “woke” ideas. Nearly 9 in 10 primary voters said that support of those issues would increase their support for a candidate.

There is no universally accepted understanding of “woke” ideas, a term that’s been reframed away from its original meaning. By now, it generally just serves as a (pejorative) umbrella term for those aforementioned efforts to recognize the country’s diversity and racial history.

YouGov also asked people whether President Biden’s second-term policies would give preference to White Americans, racial minorities or neither. Most respondents said “neither.” Most Republicans said racial minorities.

Asked the same question about Trump, nearly half the respondents said he would give preference to White Americans.

There was another question in the poll that has received less attention but shows how fertile the political environment is for the most extreme possible outcome from a Trump presidency. Respondents were asked what they were more concerned about over the next few years, whether there will be a strong economy or whether the United States will have a functioning democracy.

Overall, the results were split down the middle. Two-thirds of Democrats expressed more concern about democracy. Two-thirds of Republicans expressed more concern about the economy.

Trump and allies like adviser Stephen Miller often framed the increase in immigration as a threat to the economy, despite the increase in immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border overlapping with a period of increased employment. But the result above shows an obvious path to an erosion of democracy: use issues like immigration to argue that the economy is under threat and then sidestep democratic elections or systems to ostensibly backstop the economy.

Again, that’s a long-tail outcome. The more immediate risk, obviously, is to immigrants seeking new lives in the United States. As such, it’s worth remembering that nearly everyone in the country is a descendant of someone who moved here from somewhere else. It’s worth remembering, too, that there were similar concerns about the American identity being tainted by immigrants when the new arrivals were similarly viewed with a racially loaded skepticism."
Jan 25 2024,McConnell says immigration talks in ‘quandary’ as Trump lobbies Congress to kill deal,CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/24/politics/mcconnell-senate-gop-border-ukraine-package/index.html,"CNN —

Former President Donald Trump’s push to kill a bipartisan immigration deal may now derail a major national security package, forcing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest a new course of action and endangering aid to Ukraine and Israel in the process.

According to a GOP source familiar with the matter, McConnell told Republicans at a private Wednesday meeting that they are in a “quandary,” given that bipartisan talks over immigration have created intraparty feuding and may have closed off a path to getting a massive package approved this Congress.

The fresh doubts from the Senate GOP leader – one of the leading proponents of more aid to Ukraine – suggest Congress may have to punt on the issues altogether or break up the package into individual pieces, though no decisions have been made. McConnell’s goal at the meeting, sources said, was to lay out to his colleagues that there was no clear path ahead unless members were willing to compromise.

The new doubts come as House Republicans – with the encouragement of Trump, who is railing on immigration as a top election issue – are revolting over the bipartisan talks, even before they’ve concluded. Republicans were already divided over whether to approve any aid to Ukraine, even as they have insisted that the border must be dealt with before Ukraine aid can be approved. On top of that, the House Republican demand to pass their border security bill – HR 2 – is a non-starter with Democrats.

The candid assessment, reported earlier by Punchbowl News, underscores the growing fears that Congress won’t be able to approve aid to Ukraine at a critical moment in its war against Russia – or pass any legislation to clamp down on the surge of migrants at the southern border.

During the meeting, McConnell read a quote from Trump in 2018 that cast doubt on Democrats ever voting for border security, a message to his GOP colleagues that this may be the best opportunity Republicans have to get border security in decades.

“He did a good job of quoting Donald Trump saying in 2018 that we will never get a Democrat to vote for this [border] stuff,” Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said.

Senate Republicans engaged in a lengthy debate behind closed doors over the future of US aid to Ukraine, but the GOP emerged still divided over the best path forward as lawmakers remain stuck over how to get a bill to aid Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border across the finish line.

“We had a thorough airing of views,” Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said.

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, said at this point, he thinks he has a good sense of where everyone in the conference is but that there was no grand resolution.

“It was one of the most thoughtful discussions, sincere emotional discussions, we’ve had. I think that we will have a conference too divided on Ukraine, but we’re united in securing the border,” Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, said.

GOP members emerging said it was less about finding a unified position (there is none) and more about giving members an opportunity to state their case and engage in a debate. Members also said that McConnell played the part of “historian in the room,” reminding the conference of where they once were and the opportunity at hand on the border.

“He is attentive and he understands the historical lay of the land and it is very instructive when he does those things, when he reminds us of other opportunities lost, how far James Lankford has brought us further than we have ever been in 30 years,” Cramer said.

Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who is among those supportive of more aid, said he just wants to remind his colleagues there are consequences to not taking action.

“This won’t take decades to regret. This will be in a matter of years and so people who chose to ultimately to exit Ukraine if they are successful – for as long as I am breathing – I will remind them of the consequences I am convinced we will have to live with,” Tillis said.

Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah who is supportive of the US aiding the war effort in Ukraine, said that Sens. Jerry Moran, Jim Risch and Susan Collins made rousing appeals in support of the effort.

Cramer told reporters that Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, actually played a clip of the late Sen. John McCain talking about Russian President Vladimir Putin after the invasion of Crimea.

But it’s a delicate balance for many in the GOP conference.

“We have to figure out a way to sustain this fight without depleting our capabilities around the world. I don’t think that strategy should be whatever it costs for however long it takes. That’s neither realistic nor wise but it also can’t be we are walking away when we are done because we’ll pay a price for that too,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said.

Asked if the meeting was tense, Rubio laughed it off, saying, “Compared to what?” Reminded that Tuesday’s lunch was animated and boisterous, Rubio quipped: “That’s not tense. Just because they don’t let us bring knives and forks anymore.”

Rubio reminded reporters that was a joke.

Jan 02 2024,US to Reopen Border Crossings as Illegal Immigration Drops,U.S. News & World Report,left,https://usnews.com/news/world/articles/2024-01-02/us-to-reopen-border-crossings-as-illegal-immigration-drops,"By Ted Hesson and Kristina Cooke

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. will reopen four legal U.S.-Mexico border crossings on Thursday as high levels of illegal immigration have receded and freed up personnel, U.S. border authorities said on Tuesday.

The U.S. will resume operations at an international bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas, two crossings in Arizona and another near San Diego, California, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a press release, adding that it will continue to prioritize border security ""as necessary.""

U.S. border authorities struggled in December to process migrants as apprehensions reached nearly 11,000 in a single day, which several current and former officials said was near or at a record high.

Lawmakers remain in talks over a possible deal that would combine increased border security measures with foreign aid, including military funding for Ukraine, U.S. officials said.

""We gotta do something. They ought to give me the money I need to protect the border,"" U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters on his arrival at the White House on Tuesday evening, apparently referring to members of Congress.

Mexican and U.S. officials pledged last week to work together more closely to tackle record migration at their shared border after top U.S. officials traveled to Mexico to meet with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

Mexican officials have stepped up immigration enforcement in recent weeks, including moving migrants to southern Mexico and resuming deportation flights to Venezuela, a senior U.S. official said during a call with reporters on Tuesday, requesting anonymity as a condition of the briefing.

Mexico on Tuesday evening cheered the reopening of the border crossings.

""This will benefit the economies of both countries,"" Mexico's foreign ministry, which had previously called for the reopening of crossings between the two nations, said in a statement.

U.S. border authorities arrested an average of 6,400 migrants per day over the past week, according to an internal U.S. government report reviewed by Reuters, a steep decline from the levels before Christmas.

A separate U.S. official on the call cautioned that migrant crossings have historically dropped between Christmas and New Year's Day.

""We have seen over the last year periods of increased encounters and periods of decreased encounters,"" the official said. ""We will continue to stand ready to respond to these kinds of surges.""

Jan 26 2024,In Their Own Words: Watch How Far Left the Democrats Have Moved on Illegal Immigration,Townhall,right,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2024/01/26/in-their-own-words-watch-how-far-left-the-democrats-have-moved-on-illegal-immigration-n2634204,"It's an article of faith among many 'news' media journalists that the Republican Party has moved dramatically to the right in recent years. It isn't true. For better or worse, the GOP has shifted more toward the center on a host of issues. They've become more beholden to a single personality, yes, which has contributed to different sorts of extremism problems -- but increased and widespread ideological radicalism generally isn't among them. Democrats, by contrast, have moved drastically leftward. President Joe Biden personally embodies the shift. Look at his old positions on crime, abortion, immigration, and other issues. He's become somewhat unrecognizable, compared to his former self. As a Senator, he was the proud author of what modern critics call a draconian crime bill. By 2020, he was indulging the 'defund the police' madness, and selected a running mate who went even further.

To have any shot at winning the Democratic nomination that same cycle, he cynically abandoned his long-held supposed convictions on federal funding of abortion, and has only sprinted further into inhumane territory since getting elected because that's what the party's activist base and leftist donor class demand. We'll get to a flashback clip of Biden on immigration below, but first, here are more soundbytes that fortify my point about the profound lurch of national Democrats since the 1990's. Here's Bill Clinton addressing Congress in 1996 and pledging to crack down on illegal immigration:

""There are some areas that the federal government should not leave and should address and address strongly. One of these areas is the problem of illegal immigration. After years of neglect, this administration has taken a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders. We are increasing border controls by 50 percent. We are increasing inspections to prevent the hiring of illegal immigrants. And tonight, I announce I will sign an executive order to deny federal contracts to businesses that hire illegal immigrants. Let me be very clear about this: We are still a nation of immigrants; we should be proud of it. We should honor every legal immigrant here, working hard to become a new citizen. But we are also a nation of laws.""

By today's standards, he sounds like Ted Cruz. Fast forward roughly a decade, and here's Barack Obama opposing illegal immigration and condemning its unfairness to people going through the lawful process:

“We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked & circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently & lawfully to become immigrants in this country.” Glad we can agree on this, Barack Obama. #SecureTheBorder pic.twitter.com/osJ1dZ8WLE — Independent Women's Voice (@IWV) June 18, 2019

Which brings us to Joe. With Donald Trump, they say, 'there's always a tweet.' With Biden, there's always a video clip. How's this one?

MUST SEE CLIP. In 2007 Biden was asked if he would allow sanctuary cities to exist. His answer was NO. He said that sanctuary cities turn into dumps and the only reason they exist is because the Federal government doesn't enforce the law.



2020 Biden - Illegals make cities safer… pic.twitter.com/5GiS7WtS8I — MAZE (@mazemoore) January 25, 2024

He was running for president when he said that, and boy, does he sound different -- both in terms of his rhetoric on illegal immigration, and in terms of his verbal sharpness. Here we are today, and his administration is firmly on the side of 'sanctuary' jurisdictions, scolding the state of Texas for forcing Democratic leaders in those places to live with the consequences of their preferred policies. He has allowed eight to ten million illegal crossings on his watch, including nearly two million known got-aways. In the last election cycle, multiple Democrats running for the Oval Office even embraced the stance of effectively legalizing illegal border crossings. Biden didn't go that far with his words, but his actual policies have implemented that extreme and disastrous experiment. In addition to tens of thousands of confirmed got-aways entering the country with impunity every single month for years on end, Biden's own administration admits that more than 85 percent of 'encountered' illegal immigrants are released into America. The border is open.

I'll leave you with 'sanctuary' governors begging Biden for more taxpayer money to address the relatively small influx of migrants being sent their way by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (not a single extra cent should be given) -- as well as a growing list of governors joining the US Border Patrol Union in siding with Abbott over the Biden administration in the dramatic legal and jurisdictional standoff playing out in Eagle Pass:

That roster has only grown since Melugin first posted it (Arkansas, Iowa, Ohio, Wyoming and others have joined). States are joining the battle over authority and sovereignty. Also, Republicans in Congress should not toss a political life preserver to Biden and his party with 'bipartisan' border tinkering. Biden has caused this mess by himself, using executive action. He could largely fix it with the stroke of a pen, but he refuses. It's not the opposition party's job to bail him out with a deeply flawed 'compromise' that will not solve the problem:

Jan 28 2024,Biden and senators on verge of striking immigration deal aimed at clamping down on illegal border crossings,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/news/immigration-deal-biden-senate-us-mexico-border-bill,"Eagle Pass, Texas — A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress is on the verge of striking a deal with the Biden administration that would enact sweeping new border controls, including the authority to pause asylum processing during spikes in migrant crossings, three people familiar with the talks told CBS News.

After weeks of closed-door negotiations, the White House and a trio of senators could unveil an agreement as early as this week, the sources said, requesting anonymity due to the private nature of the conversations. The bill is designed to reduce the unprecedented levels of illegal crossings recorded along the southern border in the past three years.

While GOP Sen. James Lankford, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy and independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema are close to finalizing the compromise with the White House, any bipartisan immigration proposal would face an uphill battle in the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson and other conservative lawmakers have pushed for even stricter changes to the asylum system.

Divisions among Republican lawmakers over whether to support a border deal with Mr. Biden have also intensified after former President Donald Trump came out against it. At a rally in Las Vegas on Saturday, Trump said he would ""rather have no bill than a bad bill.""

What the immigration deal would do

If enacted into law, the emerging deal would mark the first major bipartisan overhaul of the nation's immigration system since the 1990s.

The agreement is expected to give the executive branch a new legal authority to effectively suspend asylum in between official ports of entry when migrant crossings surpass certain thresholds. That would affect remote areas in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas where migrants regularly cross into the U.S. illegally to surrender themselves to overtaxed federal immigration officials who often release them because they don't have the resources to screen everyone for asylum.

The power, which Mr. Biden referred to as an authority to ""shut down the border"" on Friday, would be mandated after average daily migrant crossings hit 5,000 over seven days, or 8,500 in a single day. It could also be activated on a discretionary basis after average daily crossings surpass 4,000 in a week. There would also be a limit on the number of days each year the president could invoke the authority.

When the authority is invoked, migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally would not be allowed to ask for asylum, and would face swift deportation to Mexico or their home country. Exceptions would be made for those who pass screenings for other, more difficult-to-obtain forms of humanitarian refuge, including protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.

Current U.S. law allows most migrants on American soil to request asylum, even if they enter the country unlawfully.

On Friday, Mr. Biden said he would use the new powers ""the day I sign the bill into law,"" calling the emerging deal the ""toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border we've ever had in our country.""

While the proposal negotiated by the White House and lawmakers would penalize those who enter the U.S. illegally, it would preserve asylum at official ports of entry. In fact, it would require U.S. border officials to continue processing more than 1,400 asylum-seekers daily at these official border crossings when the ""shutdown"" authority is invoked, sources told CBS News.

The other proposals

Other border-related proposals that will likely be in any deal include expanding the scope of the expedited removal authority; instructing immigration officials to decide asylum cases within six months, as opposed to the current years-long timeframe; and raising the standard of proof in initial asylum interviews.

Those who pass their initial humanitarian protection screenings, including when the ""shutdown"" authority is in place, would generally be released pending a full review of their cases with immediate eligibility to work in the U.S., a change that would likely be welcomed by Democratic officials in communities struggling to house migrants relying on local services. There's also a proposal to provide lawyers to asylum-seekers.

One of the most contentious issues in the negotiations has been the immigration parole authority, which Mr. Biden has used on a large scale to resettle more than 1 million refugees and migrants. Negotiators have discussed limiting the use of parole at land borders, but the White House has resisted broader restrictions pushed by Republicans. The deal is not expected to shut down Biden administration parole programs that allow U.S.-based individuals to sponsor the entry of certain Latin American migrants and Ukrainians, the sources familiar with the talks said.

All the provisions being negotiated would require an enormous surge in personnel and resources, including detention facilities and deportation flights, to be implemented. The Biden administration has asked for $14 billion to fund border operations and hire additional asylum officers, border agents and immigration judges.

The compromise is also expected to include provisions related to legal immigration. Negotiators have agreed to allocate 50,000 new family and employment-based immigrant visas, offer permanent residency to tens of thousands of Afghans brought to the U.S. following the fall of Kabul in 2021 and provide immigration status to the children of H-1B visa holders, the people familiar with the talks said.

The agreement would not legalize any of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission, including so-called ""Dreamers"" brought to the country as minors, a group championed by Democrats for decades.

U.S. immigration officials processed more than 302,000 migrants along the southern border in December, a record high, according to official government data published Friday. Illegal crossings there have since plummeted, a trend U.S. officials have attributed to increased Mexican immigration enforcement and a historical lull after the holiday season."

Jan 26 2024,Trump Urges States to Send National Guard Troops to Texas to Help Prevent Illegal Immigration,Independent Journal Review,right,https://ijr.com/trump-states-send-national-guard-troops-texas-help-prevent-illegal-immigration,"Former President Donald Trump is weighing in on the border standoff between Texas and the federal government.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “When I was President, we had the most secure Border in History. Joe Biden has surrendered our Border, and is aiding and abetting a massive Invasion of millions of Illegal Migrants into the United States.”

“Instead of fighting to protect our Country from this onslaught, Biden is, unbelievably, fighting to tie the hands of Governor Abbott and the State of Texas, so that the Invasion continues unchecked. In the face of this National Security, Public Safety, and Public Health Catastrophe, Texas has rightly invoked the Invasion Clause of the Constitution, and must be given full support to repel the Invasion,” conitnued.

He went on to urge other states to send National Guard troops to the border in Texas:

“We encourage all willing States to deploy their guards to Texas to prevent the entry of Illegals, and to remove them back across the Border. All Americans should support the commonsense measures by Texas authorities to protect the Safety, Security, and Sovereignty of Texas, and of the American people.”

JUST IN: Donald Trump is calling on all willing states to send their national guards to the state of Texas to help defend the southern border.

The announcement comes as Republican governors are rallying behind Texas against President Joe Biden.

Finally, Trump said, “When I am President, on Day One, instead of fighting Texas, I will work hand in hand with Governor Abbott and other Border States to Stop the Invasion, Seal the Border, and Rapidly Begin the Largest Domestic Deportation Operation in History. Those Biden has let in should not get comfortable because they will be going home.”

His comment comes as 25 Republican governors have expressed support for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) as tensions simmer with the federal government over the U.S.-Mexico border.

The governors signed onto a statement Republican Governors Association (RGA) which accused the Biden administration of leaving “Americans and our country completely vulnerable to unprecedented illegal immigration pouring across the Southern border.”

“Instead of upholding the rule of law and securing the border, the Biden Administration has attacked and sued Texas for stepping up to protect American citizens from historic levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and terrorists entering our country,” the statement continued.

Finally, it concluded, “We stand in solidarity with our fellow Governor, Greg Abbott, and the State of Texas in utilizing every tool and strategy, including razor wire fences, to secure the border. We do it in part because the Biden Administration is refusing to enforce immigration laws already on the books and is illegally allowing mass parole across America of migrants who entered our country illegally.”

Earlier this week, the Supreme Court ruled the federal government could remove razor wire fencing put up by Texas along a 30-mile stretch of land near the border.

In a statement after that ruling, Abbott accused Biden of breaking the compact between states and the federal government by failing to secure the border. He also labeled the wave of illegal migration an invasion, which he said gives him the authority to “defend and protect” Texas.

“That authority is the supreme law of the land and supersedes any federal statutes to the contrary. The Texas National Guard, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and other Texas personnel are acting on that authority, as well as state law, to secure the Texas border,” Abbott added."
Dec 27 2023,"US, Mexico officials meet to talk immigration, border",San Jose Mercury News,left,https://mercurynews.com/2023/12/27/us-mexico-officials-meet-to-talk-immigration-border,"By Maria Verza and Edgar H. Clemente | Associated Press

MEXICO CITY — A top U.S. delegation met with Mexico’s president Wednesday in what many saw as an attempt to have Mexico do more to limit a surge of migrants reaching the U.S. southwestern border.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has said he is willing to help, but he wants to see progress in U.S. relations with Cuba and Venezuela, two of the top sources of migrants, along with more development aid for the region.

But Mexico’s top priority appeared to be getting the United States to reopen border crossings that were closed because of the migrant surge.

“We spoke about the importance of the border, and about the economic relationship … the importance of reopening the border crossings, that is a priority for us,” Foreign Relations Secretary Alicia Bárcena said after the meeting.

Both sides in the talks face pressure to reach an agreement after past steps like limiting direct travel into Mexico or deporting some migrants failed to stop the influx. This month, as many as 10,000 migrants were arrested daily at the southwest U.S. border.

The U.S. has struggled to process thousands of migrants at the border, and house them once they reach northern cities. And Mexican industries were stung last week when the U.S. briefly closed two vital Texas railway crossings, arguing that border patrol agents had to be reassigned to deal with the surge. Another non-rail border crossing remained closed in Lukeville, Arizona, and operations were partially suspended in San Diego and Nogales, Arizona.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken left open the possibility that those crossings could be reopened if Mexico provides more help.

“Secretary Blinken will discuss unprecedented irregular migration in the Western Hemisphere and identify ways Mexico and the United States will address border security challenges, including actions to enable the reopening of key ports of entry across our shared border,” his office said.

Mexico says it detected 680,000 migrants moving through the country in the first 11 months of 2023.

Mexico has assigned over 32,000 military troops and National Guard officers — about 11% of its total forces — to enforce immigration laws, and the National Guard now detains far more migrants than criminals.

But the shortcomings of that approach were on display Tuesday, when National Guard officers made no attempt to stop a caravan of about 6,000 migrants, many from Central America and Venezuela, from walking through Mexico’s main inland immigration inspection point in southern Chiapas state near the Guatemala border.

In the past, Mexico has let such caravans go through, trusting that they would tire themselves out walking along the highway.

By Wednesday, Lazara Padrón Molina, 46, from Cuba was sick and exhausted. The caravan set out Dec. 24 from the city of Tapachula and had walked about 45 miles (75 kilometers) through the heat to Escuintla in southern Chiapas state.

“The route is too long to continue walking. Why don’t they just give us documents so that we could get a bus or a taxi?” Padrón Molina said. “Look at my feet,” she said, showing blisters. “I can’t go on anymore.”

But wearing the migrants out — by obliging Venezuelans and others to hike through the jungle-clad Darien Gap, or corralling migrants off passenger buses in Mexico — no longer appears to work.

So many migrants have been hopping freight trains through Mexico that one of the country’s two major railroad companies suspended trains in September because of safety concerns. Police raids to pull migrants off railway cars — the kind of action Mexico took a decade ago — might be one thing the American delegation would like to see.

A few blocks from Mexico City’s main plaza — where Blinken will meet with López Obrador at the National Palace — migrants stayed at an improvised shelter at a church, gathering strength before continuing north.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall also are attending the meeting.

The U.S. has shown that one country’s problems on the border quickly become both countries’ problems. The Texas railway closures put a chokehold on freight moving from Mexico to the U.S., as well as grain needed to feed Mexican livestock moving south.

López Obrador confirmed last week that U.S. officials want Mexico to do more to block migrants at its southern border with Guatemala, or make it more difficult to move across Mexico by train or in trucks or buses, a policy known as “contention.”

But the president said that in exchange he wanted the United States to send more development aid to migrants’ home countries, and to reduce or eliminate sanctions against Cuba and Venezuela.

“We are going to help, as we always do,” López Obrador said. “Mexico is helping reach agreements with other countries, in this case Venezuela.” He said Mexico has proposed to President Joe Biden that a U.S.-Cuba bilateral dialogue be opened.

In May, Mexico agreed to take in migrants from countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba who had been turned away by the U.S. for not following rules that provided new legal pathways to asylum and other forms of migration."
Jan 16 2024,U.S. Civil Rights Commission: Illegal Immigration Makes Black Americans Poorer,Breitbart News,right,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/15/us-civil-rights-commission-illegal-immigration-makes-black-americans-poorer/,"Mass immigration, and primarily illegal immigration, disproportionately makes black Americans poorer by reducing wages and crowding out the workforce, the United States Civil Rights Commission detailed in a briefing report from 2010.

The bombshell report, conducted in 2008 and published in 2010 by the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, interviewed several experts and researchers reviewing the impact of mass immigration on black American communities.

The report addressed “the consensus by panelists that there is a negative effect on wages of low-skill black workers and the range of the negative effects,” and found that the nation’s importation of tens of millions of illegal aliens and legal immigrants over decades has only exacerbated the problems of America’s poor and working class.

Annually, the federal government gives green cards to more than a million legal immigrants in addition to about 1.2 million foreign nationals who are given work visas to take American jobs. At the same time, there are an estimated 15.5 million illegal aliens in the U.S. today.

Black men, the report showed, are most negatively impacted by illegal immigration because they are “disproportionately employed in the low-skilled labor market, where they are more likely to be in labor competition with immigrants” with about 6 in 10 adult black men having a high school diploma or less.

The report states:

Illegal immigration to the United States in recent decades has tended to depress both wages and employment rates for low-skilled American citizens, a disproportionate number of whom are black men. Expert economic opinions concerning the negative effects range from modest to significant. Those panelists that found modest effects overall nonetheless found significant effects in industry sectors such as meatpacking and construction. [Emphasis added]

The report reflects recent data from the Brookings Institute which found that the wealth gap between black Americans and white Americans has continued to grow significantly since 1992. This growing wealth gap coincides with the inflow of tens of millions of illegal aliens and legal immigrants who inflate the labor market and are a boon to business and Wall Street.

“… from 1989 to 2022, the Black-white median wealth gap has averaged $172,000, and rarely dropped below 10% of this,” the Brookings Institute writes:

However, between 2019 and 2022, the gap breeched 10% of the average—signaling an increase in disparity not seen since 2007, when the gap reached $214,970. The growing disparity means that in 2022, for every $100 in wealth held by white households, Black households held only $15. [Emphasis added]

Vernon Briggs Jr., former professor emeritus of labor economics at Cornell University, told the Commission that “no issue has negatively ‘affected the economic well-being of African Americans more’ than immigration,” according to the report:

Dr. Briggs emphasized that the distinguishing characteristic of the illegal immigrant population is that 81 percent of them are probably in the low-skill sector of the job market; about 57 percent of them are without a high school diploma, and 24 percent have only a high school diploma. Since they often come from poor countries, he said, the quality of their education is likely poor, and they frequently lack English language skills. According to Dr. Briggs, the competition they pose for native youth and 43 million low-skilled U.S. workers causes the low-skilled labor market to suffer the highest unemployment levels of any measured segment. He further noted that the low skilled labor market is most vulnerable to economic hardship. During an economic downturn, higher skilled workers back up into the low skilled labor market, producing even more competition for low-skilled jobs. [Emphasis added]

U.S. employers prefer to hire illegal aliens over poorer native-born Americans, Georgetown University professor and economist Harry Holzer told the Commission, “because of a perceived superior work ethic and tolerance for low wages, and use ethnic networks to recruit.”

“Dr. Holzer … indicates that employers filling low-wage jobs that require little reading/writing or communication, clearly prefer immigrants to native-born blacks, and encourage informal networks through which immigrants gain better access to these jobs,” the report states.

Dr. Carol Swain, formerly a professor at Vanderbilt University, told the Commission that the federal government ought to create an independent commission dedicated to reforming the nation’s immigration levels designed to lift Americans out of poverty while imposing far higher costs on American employers who choose to hire illegal aliens.

The Commission, at the time of the report, recommended the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collect data related to illegal aliens in the U.S. labor market and track the impact on working class wages and blue-collar American workers. While BLS collects data on the foreign-born workforce, the agency has yet to compile data on illegal aliens and their impact on American wages.

The high-stakes meeting involving congressional leaders, key committee chairs, ranking members and national security officials focused on supplemental funding for Ukraine, as well as enhanced border security measures and immigration policy changes, lawmakers said after the meeting.

""I am more optimistic than ever before that we come to an agreement,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told reporters.

For months, the supplemental spending package requested by the president has been up in the air after congressional Republicans made their backing contingent on the Ukraine aid being tied to stricter border policies. Senate negotiations aimed at forging a compromise on immigration issues dragged through the holidays and into the new year.

Seeking to attract a group of moderates from both parties to back the aid package, senators have been circling a middle-ground deal that would represent a major breakthrough after decades of failed efforts in Congress to reform the immigration system.

""There was a large amount of agreement around the table, that we must do Ukraine, and we must do border. There was tremendous focus on Ukraine, and an understanding that if we don't come to Ukraine's aid, that the consequences for America around the globe would be nothing short of devastating,"" Schumer said.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, described it as ""a very positive, forward-looking, candid discussion"" in which there was ""broad agreement"" that the U.S. should continue to support Ukraine. He said there was also ""an openness"" to address the situation at the border in a bipartisan manner.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said it was a ""productive meeting"" and that he was insistent with the president that border security be prioritized ahead of Ukraine aid.

""We understand that all these things are important, but we must insist that the border be the top priority,"" Johnson said after the meeting. ""I think we have some consensus around that table. Everyone understands the urgency of that.""

In a readout of the meeting, the White House said Mr. Biden made clear that inaction on Ukraine endangers the national security of the U.S and its allies and that there must be action to address the challenges at the border.

Before the meeting, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Mr. Biden wanted to lay out why it was urgent to continue supporting Ukraine ""and why that's needed now and how that affects our own national security.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, anticipated that the Senate could vote on a supplemental package next week.

But even if the Senate reaches and passes a deal on immigration, its prospects for approval in the House are far from certain.

House Republicans skeptical of Senate immigration talks

Johnson said at a news conference earlier Wednesday that House Republicans were ""anxious"" to see the Senate agreement on border security and acknowledged the ""thoughtful"" negotiations. But he quickly cast doubt on whether there would be support for the immigration reform in the lower chamber.

""I don't think now is the time for comprehensive immigration reform, because we know how complicated that is,"" Johnson said, noting that it can't be done quickly. ""I do think it's past time to secure the border.""

House Republicans have stood firm on a demand that a House-passed border security bill known as H.R. 2 be the baseline of any immigration agreement — a nonstarter in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

Johnson touted H.R. 2 again on Wednesday, noting that it would restore the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy, end the quick release of migrants into the U.S., reform the asylum and parole processes and resume construction of the southern border wall.

""Those elements are critically important,"" Johnson said. ""You can't choose from among those on a menu and assume that you're going to solve the problem.""

The speaker said House Republicans are ""demanding real, transformative policy change,"" noting that they're ""standing on that line,"" which he said he plans to tell the president at Wednesday's meeting.

He also said House Republicans need answers to ""critical questions"" about the U.S. strategy in Ukraine and accountability for funding to Kyiv.

""We need to know that Ukraine would not be another Afghanistan,"" Johnson said.

When asked how Mr. Biden would navigate Johnson's demand that the border be addressed before Ukraine, Jean-Pierre said the House speaker ""is not the only congressperson in the room today.""

""There will be other congressional members,"" she said. ""The president has been really clear. He wants to talk about Ukraine, the urgency of making sure we continue that assistance to Ukraine, what that means not just for the broader world, national security, but also for us.""

GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, who serves as the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said Mr. Biden acknowledged in the meeting that there needs to be ""significant changes"" at the border.

""He said the border's broken, we need to fix it,"" McCaul told reporters.

A majority of city councilors took extraordinary measures on Wednesday to reject Councilor Jayme Fowler’s proposed ordinance that would have prohibited city funds from being used to house, accommodate or provide public benefits to illegal immigrants.

Councilors first voted to waive City Charter and City Council rules to vote on the proposed ordinance at its first reading. Proposed ordinances typically come before the council twice before a vote. The second vote was on the ordinance itself. Both votes were 6-2; Councilor Lori Decter Wright was not present.

Councilors voting to reject the ordinance were Phil Lakin, Jeannie Cue, Laura Bellis, Vanessa Hall-Harper, Crista Patrick and Christian Bengal.

Bellis initiated the council votes.

Those voting against rejecting the ordinance were Fowler and Councilor Grant Miller.

Prior to the vote, Fowler, who is running for mayor, said he had never seen such a thing.

“I think it was just kind of a real cheap shot, quite frankly,” Fowler said. “A low blow.”

Fowler went on to explain why he was proposing the ordinance, noting that cities such as Denver have spent millions of taxpayer dollars to respond to the wave of illegal immigrants who have shown up recently in their cities.

“There’s a big, big difference between refugees seeking proper asylum and those who have entered our country illegally. And that’s what I am talking about,” Fowler said. “Ladies and gentlemen, I want everybody to look up and down the aisle, up and down the row.

“When we cast this vote, I want everybody in this city to remember who cast that vote, every last one. I will see you in the political season.”

Lakin responded by saying he wanted “everybody to remember who brought this ridiculous ordinance to the table.”

Miller said he would vote against rejecting the ordinance because he believes it is important for the process to play out as it normally would and for the public to have a chance to comment on the proposal at a second reading.

He added that his vote was not necessarily indicative of how he felt about the ordinance itself.

“There’s a reason why there’s two readings, and that reason is being usurped by Councilor Bellis right now,” Miller said. “And so I think we should at least have the public have the opportunity to be heard.”

Patrick said that the longer councilors entertained the ordinance the more credence they gave to it and the more they discussed the proposal the more damage it would do.

“For every time that we say that it’s OK to question somebody’s immigration status is another time that a child or a person is getting threatened because of the way that they look,” Patrick said. “In my district, where a majority of the people have brown skin, … it is a real thing that they get treated differently.

“They get abused because of these conversations. So we need to stop this now.”

The highly unusual vote came just hours after a council committee meeting in which Fowler updated his colleagues on the latest version of the proposal.

The three-page document included several significant changes from previous versions, including adding “asylum seekers” to the definition of illegal immigrants and imposing a fine of no more than $5,500 for individuals or organizations that failed to comply with the ordinance.

The proposed ordinance also would have required grant recipients to maintain and make readily accessible to the city their ledgers documenting the allocation and expenditure of funds.

Nonprofits or other nongovernmental organizations that failed to comply with the ordinance would have been disqualified from receiving city funding for a minimum of three years. City employees and contractors who violated the ordinance would have been terminated and could not have worked for the city again for a minimum of 10 years.

Fowler has said from the start that his proposal was meant to be a prudent step to ensure that the city’s finances were not damaged by a massive influx of illegal immigrants.

But Lakin and other councilors pushed back on Wednesday night, saying they had urged Fowler to work with them in a collaborative fashion from the start but that he had failed to do so.

“I’ll just say I tried to have a conversation with you last week or two weeks ago about this, and the ordinance that came back to us today was far worse than the ordinance that was originally presented,” Lakin said.

Bengel cautioned Fowler against pointing fingers at his colleagues, noting that, like Lakin, several councilors had encouraged him to take a more collaborative approach.

“You’ve kind of just come back with just argument after argument, and the language has just gotten worse to me,” Bengel said. “So, again, I feel like there was adequate support to help you to work on this so that it could be brought in a different way.

“But, again, this is just something you’ve pushed on your own. So, again, if this is how you choose to do it, then, again, I’m more than happy for people to be pissed off at me because I voted against it. And I don’t care who it is.”

Lakin closed out his remarks by telling Fowler that if he were making his decisions based on politics, “then your guiding light is wrong.”

“You should be using your heart and your brain,” Lakin said. “And I’m shocked and surprised that you are not using those things in determining what kind of legislation you put before this council and you put before the citizens of this city.”

Fowler responded in kind.

“Councilor Lakin, councilors, there are a lot of people that have … gotten very, very tired of being looted and fleeced. They’re fed up with it,” he said. “And there is a very, very large, silent majority that you’ll hear from. I promise you.

“People are tired of being looted and fleeced over and over and over, and we’ve still got people out on the streets — we can’t even get them housed, and we’re willing to take on more. You’re crazy. Absolutely crazy, Lakin. Come on. Grow up.”

If he chooses to, Fowler could reintroduce the ordinance after 90 days.

Mar 16 2024,"Trump, immigration, MAGA and more: How Ohio Republicans are weighing their Senate choice",NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-immigration-maga-ohio-republicans-are-weighing-senate-choice-rcna143520,"WINTERSVILLE, Ohio — Wesley Starr, 73, is still not sure who he is going to vote for in Ohio’s Republican primary for U.S. Senate.

“I’m impressed by all three candidates. I like all three of them,” he told NBC News at the Jefferson County Lincoln Day dinner.

Voters like Starr may well decide a close race for the GOP nomination to take on Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown later this year. It’s one of the most important Senate races around the country, and Republican voters are weighing factors including businessman Bernie Moreno’s endorsement from former President Donald Trump and other MAGA personalities, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s record in office and military experience, and state Sen. Matt Dolan’s attempt to balance his appeal to those who want a different version of the Republican Party while still showing support for Trump.

NBC News talked with more than 30 Republican and independent voters across Ohio in the last week to get a sense of what matters to them as they choose a nominee.

“[Moreno] is supported by Donald Trump, which gives him a leg up in this particular race, but both LaRose and Dolan have very strong, strong profiles and good experience,” Starr said. By the end of his conversation with NBC News, he said he was leaning towards voting for Moreno because of that endorsement.

As he has in many other state and local elections since 2016, Trump looms large. Brian Kolkowski, who says Trump had his vote starting in June of 2015, says Trump’s endorsement of Moreno “made a big difference” for him.

“I want to support Trump. I want to make sure that he has the team in place to be able to actually change law,” he said.

Moreno has made a concerted effort to align himself with Trump and members of the MAGA movement, including Sen. JD Vance, Rep. Jim Jordan and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who are all scheduled to speak at Trump’s rally with Moreno on Saturday.

Moreno told NBC News that their attendance at the rally shows that their wing of the party “is going to drive a spear right through the heart” of the old-line GOP, name-checking Dolan and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (who is backing Dolan) as well as Trump critics like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Sen. MItt Romney of Utah.

“We’re going to make certain that the America First party, the Republican Party, the new Republican Party cares for working class Americans … cares about voters in the base of the party,” Moreno continued.

But not everyone is swayed by Trump’s endorsement. Ben Batenburg, 73, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and plans to vote for Trump in the general election, but he plans to vote for LaRose on Tuesday.

“I look at the individual. And President Trump can endorse whoever he wants, that doesn’t mean to say that I’m going to support that person,” Batenburg told NBC News. “I do support Trump’s policies and I support LaRose’s policies.”

Linda Ragsdale, 66, will also be voting for LaRose and told NBC News: “I believe in President Trump. But you have a mind of your own, we have free will.”

During a LaRose meet and greet in Mingo Junction, Ohio, a voter asked LaRose why Jordan, Vance and Trump endorsed Moreno.

LaRose said, “You have to ask them,” adding, “I can tell you this. Most voters don’t make their decision based on endorsements.”

Afterwards, LaRose also attempted to underscore what he calls the “excellent relationship” he has with Trump.

“I had dinner with him just a couple of months ago and I’ll be his best ally in the U.S. Senate,” LaRose said. “I think once Trump made that endorsement, there was candidly a lot of bandwagon-jumping for people that just wanted to go along with him. But I’m the one that can beat Brown, and I will stand with President Trump every step of the way.”

“So there is no daylight between me and Donald Trump,” LaRose continued, “and on the 20th of March when this primary is over, there’s no hard feelings that he made the wrong choice in who he endorsed in this race.”

Nick McNeil, 20, who attended the final Republican Senate primary debate at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, voted early for Dolan. He was a Nikki Haley supporter in the 2024 presidential race and said he’s not sure who he is going to vote for in the presidential election in November.

McNeil told NBC News he was deciding between Moreno and Dolan but ultimately went with Dolan.

“I think the Trump endorsement really swayed me away from [Moreno]. That really doesn’t appeal to me,” McNeil said.

Dolan spoke to NBC News about how helpful he considers DeWine’s endorsement, in the face of all the big-name support backing Moreno: “I think DeWine helps me win Republican votes. And I think his point was two things. I get things done that help Ohio — I can do the same in Washington. But I also could beat Sherrod Brown, so I think that’s a crossover appeal to all Republicans.”

When asked about the Trump rallying in Ohio for Moreno days before the primary, Dolan said, “Bernie is the Trump-endorsed candidate, and they must feel that Bernie needs help.”

For most Republican voters in Ohio, regardless of whether they are supporting Moreno, LaRose or Dolan, a top policy issue for them is immigration and the southern border.

Dorene Evans, 63, who is planning on casting her ballot for LaRose, believes immigration is “out of control.” She fears that “there are terrorists that got across the border.”

Stephen Bastian, 24, who is planning on voting for Dolan, said border security is his top issue, too. “I just think it’s important to keep our country safe and protected,” he said.

Kolkowski, who is supporting Moreno, told NBC News, “And with the border, I think that’s one of the biggest issues right now. I think we need to get the border closed down and we need to clean up the mess that President Biden has left us.”

But while there are unifying issues, the divide between factions of the Republican Party can be just as clear talking to the candidates’ supporters as it is talking to the candidates.

Sherri Garner Brumbaugh, 62, who has over 30 years of experience in the trucking industry and is supporting Moreno, believes this is a “crucial time for the state of Ohio.”

“As Republicans, we’re going to be traditional old-school Republicans or we’re going to change ourselves as Republicans,” she told NBC News. “I’m looking for that change in Washington, and Bernie Moreno is going to bring it.”

Meanwhile Amy Sabath, 52, who currently runs a nonprofit for a community college and was a political operative in Ohio who has held top positions on GOP campaigns, including for DeWine and Dolan, is planning on supporting Dolan and recognizes the split between the GOP in this race.

“I think the concern the ultra-conservative vote is probably going to split between Moreno and LaRose, but I’m hoping there’s a nice path for Dolan to come up through the middle with the more — I don’t want to say moderate Republicans, but maybe that is the better word,” Sabath said in an interview with NBC News. “I’ve always considered myself an ultra-conservative Republican, but I just believe in the right candidate, and the right candidate is Dolan.”

Dolan was door-knocking in Aurora, Ohio, on Tuesday afternoon when he encountered Reed Fuller, a voter who said he’d been a life-long Republican — until Trump took office.

“My heart says until Trump is gone, I will never vote Republican again. Sorry,” he told Dolan.

Aurora Mayor Ann Womer Benjamin tried to sway Fuller to vote for Dolan by noting that he’s “not a Trump person,” which garnered approval from Fuller, who added later that if he had to choose between the three candidates, he would choose Dolan.

As Dolan walked away he said, “We will bring you back into the fold.”

Fuller responded, “If you can do that, that’s fine with me.”"

Mar 12 2024,Supreme Court continues pause on stringent new Texas immigration law,United Press International,center,https://upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/03/12/Alito-Supreme-Court-Texas-immigration/9381710264185,"Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito Jr. (pictured in 2022) extended a hold on a new Texas law that would allow the state to arrest and prosecute individuals for allegedly crossing the border illegally.

March 12 (UPI) -- Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito placed the latest hold on a Texas law that would allow the state to arrest and prosecute individuals for allegedly crossing the border illegally. Federal officials argue that any immigration enforcement role is theirs and does not belong to the states. Advertisement

Last year, Texas lawmakers passed Senate Bill 4, arguing that border crossings from Mexico amounted to an invasion. Opponents pushed back, saying immigration is a function of the federal government and the new Texas law increases the prospect of racial profiling and other human-rights violations.

Alito said the pause would give Supreme Court justices more time to review a brief filed by the Biden administration asking that enforcement of the law be blocked and did not indicate any opinion by them.

The Texas law was supposed to have gone into effect March 5 but U.S. District Judge David Ezra temporarily blocked it, calling it likely unconstitutional because it conflicts with federal law.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, backed by Gov. Greg Abbott, said the Constitution supports a state's right to defend itself from what they said are cartels flooding the state with drugs and human trafficking.

Ezra rejected Paxton's description of border crossings as akin to an invasion.

Paxton appealed Ezra's decision to the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has set a hearing in April."
Feb 27 2024,The economy is roaring. Immigration is a key reason.,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/02/27/economy-immigration-border-biden/,"correction A previous version of this article incorrectly described a Congressional Budget Office projection on the effects of immigration on the economy. The report said the labor force will have grown by 5.2 million people by 2033, not that it had grown by that number in 2023. This article has been corrected. Immigration has propelled the U.S. job market further than just about anyone expected, helping cement the country’s economic rebound from the pandemic as the most robust in the world. That momentum picked up aggressively over the past year. About 50 percent of the labor market’s extraordinary recent growth came from foreign-born workers between January 2023 and January 2024, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis of federal data. And even before that, by the middle of 2022, the foreign-born labor force had grown so fast that it closed the labor force gap created by the pandemic, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Immigrant workers also recovered much faster than native-born workers from the pandemic’s disruptions, and many saw some of the largest wage gains in industries eager to hire. Economists and labor experts say the surge in employment was ultimately key to solving unprecedented gaps in the economy that threatened the country’s ability to recover from prolonged shutdowns.

“Immigration has not slowed. It has just been absolutely astronomical,” said Pia Orrenius, vice president and senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. “And that’s been instrumental. You can’t grow like this with just the native workforce. It’s not possible.”

Yet immigration remains an intensely polarizing issue in American politics. Fresh survey data from Gallup showed Americans now cite immigration as the country’s top problem, surpassing inflation, the economy and issues with government. A record number of migrants have crossed the southern border since President Biden took office, with apprehensions topping 2 million for the second straight year in fiscal 2023, among the highest in U.S. history. Cities like New York, Chicago and Denver have struggled to keep up with busloads of immigrants sent from Texas who are overwhelming local shelters.

Washington is deadlocked on a solution to the crisis. Senate Republicans and a handful of Democrats voted down a sweeping $118 billion national security package that included changes to the nation’s asylum system and a way to effectively close the border to most migrants when crossings are particularly high. House Republican leadership called the legislation “dead on arrival,” which seemed all but guaranteed after former president Donald Trump came out strongly in opposition.

Opinion polls show that voters widely disapprove of Biden’s handling of the border, and Trump, who is closing in on the Republican nomination, is touting plans for aggressive deportation policies if he wins in November. Republicans have increasingly campaigned on the idea that immigrants have hurt the economy and taken Americans’ jobs. But the economic record largely shows the opposite.

There isn’t much data on how many of the new immigrants in recent years were documented vs. undocumented. But estimates from the Pew Research Center last fall showed that undocumented immigrants made up 22 percent of the total foreign-born U.S. population in 2021. That’s down compared with previous decades: Between 2007 and 2021, the undocumented population fell by 14 percent, Pew found. Meanwhile, the legal immigrant population grew by 29 percent.

Whoever wins the election will take the helm of an economy that immigrant workers are supporting tremendously — and likely will keep powering for years to come.

Fresh estimates from the Congressional Budget Office this month said the U.S. labor force will have grown by 5.2 million people by 2033, thanks especially to net immigration. The economy is projected to grow by $7 trillion more over the next decade than it would have without new influxes of immigrants, according to the CBO.

Alexander Santander, 49, is among those immigrants. Santander trekked for two months with his family, including two young children, from Venezuela to the Texas border last fall to seek asylum. He said it was a “very, very traumatic” journey that involved many nights sleeping on cardboard in the jungle.

For Santander, who is on humanitarian parole as he waits for his asylum case to be processed, the decision to uproot his life in Venezuela, where he worked as an operating room nurse, was difficult but necessary, he said. His family had faced years of food shortages and, more recently, threats for protesting the government.

“Thank God we made it here,” Santander, who now works in manufacturing in Denver, said in Spanish. “We have many more opportunities and already a better quality of life.”

‘The biggest pull’

Research broadly shows that immigration has long helped the U.S. economy grow. But today’s snapshot still represents a stark turnaround from just a short time ago.

The flow of migrants to the United States started slowing during the Trump administration, when officials took hundreds of executive actions designed to restrict migration.

Then the coronavirus hit, restricting border crossings even further. Right before the pandemic, there were about 1.5 million fewer working-age immigrants in the United States than pre-2017 trends would have predicted, according to the San Francisco Fed. By the end of 2021, that shortfall had widened to about 2 million, researchers at the Global Migration Center at the University of California at Davis have shown.

But the economy overall wound up rebounding aggressively from the sudden, widespread closures of 2020, bolstered by historic government stimulus and vaccines that debuted faster than expected.

The sudden snapback in demand sent inflation soaring. Supply chain issues were a main reason prices rose quickly. But labor shortages posed a problem, too, and economists feared that rising wages — as employers scrambled to find workers — would keep price increases dangerously high.

Share this article Share

That’s because the labor force that emerged as the pandemic ebbed was smaller than it had been: Millions of people retired early, stayed home to take over child care or avoid getting sick, or decided to look for new jobs entirely. In the span of a year or so, employers went from having businesses crater to sprinting to hire enough staff to keep restaurants, hotels, retail stores and construction sites going. Wages for the lowest earners rose at the fastest pace.

About the same time, the path was widening for migrants to cross the southern border, particularly as the new Biden administration rolled back Trump-era restrictions.

In normal economic times, some analysts note, new immigrants can drag down wages, especially if employers decide to hire them over native-born workers. Undocumented workers, who don’t have as much leverage to push for higher pay, could lower average wages even more.

But the past few years were extremely abnormal because companies were desperate to hire. Plus, it would be exceedingly difficult for immigration to affect the wages of enormous swaths of the labor force, said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.

“What it can do is lower the wages of a specific occupation in a specific area, but American workers aren’t stupid. They change jobs. They change what they specialize in,” Nowrasteh said. “So that’s part of the reason why wages don’t go down.”

Experts argue that the strength of the U.S. economy has benefited American workers and foreign-born workers alike. Each group accounts for roughly half of the labor market’s impressive year-over-year growth since January 2023, according to an Economic Policy Institute analysis that used three-month rolling averages in labor force participation to account for data volatility.

Particularly for immigrants fleeing poorer countries, the booming U.S. job market and the promise of higher wages continue to be an enormous draw.

“More than any immigration policy per se, the biggest pull for migrants is the strength of the labor market,” said Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes, an economics professor at the University of California at Merced. “More than any enforcement policy, any immigration policy, at the end of the day.”

‘A much better job’

Upon arriving in Denver in October, Santander hadn’t acquired a work permit but needed to feed his small children. Even without authorization, he found a job as a roofer for a contractor that ultimately pocketed his earnings, then one cleaning industrial refrigerators on the overnight shift for $12 an hour. Since receiving his work permit in January, Santander has started “a much better job” at a wood accessories manufacturer making $20 an hour.

But for the vast majority of migrants who arrive in the United States without prior approval, including asylum seekers and those who come for economic reasons, getting a work permit isn’t easy.

Federal law requires migrants to wait nearly six months to receive a work permit after filing for asylum. Wait times can stretch for additional months because of a backlog in cases. While they wait, many migrants find off-the-books work as day laborers or street vendors, advocates say. Others get jobs using falsified documents, including many teenagers who came into the country as unaccompanied minors.

Still, many migrants miss the year-long window to apply for asylum — a process that can cost thousands of dollars — leaving them with few pathways to work authorization, advocates say. Those who can’t apply for asylum often end up working without official permission in low-wage industries where they are susceptible to exploitation.

That includes many of the migrants coming to the United States to escape economic hardship, which alone does not qualify as a valid reason to seek asylum or qualify for a work permit.

One such worker — who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal due to his immigration status — said he left his remote village in Mexico in 2022 because he had no hope of ever being able to afford to build a house with his income as a civil servant.

He said it was easy to find his current job in Chicago — scouring a tortilla factory on the overnight shift for $16.75 an hour. But the city is vast and hard to navigate without a car, he said.

“My dream is to save enough money to build a house on my land in Mexico to return to,” he said in Spanish. “Then if for some reason I get deported to Mexico, at least I’ll have somewhere that’s mine to live.”

In Dalton, Ga. — known as the “Carpet Capital of the World” — Jan Pourquoi said the entire economy would collapse without immigrant workers. Pourquoi owns a rug company with a warehouse near the city’s railroad tracks and pays $11 an hour for jobs like cutting and sewing door and bathroom mats. He said that he doesn’t question anyone’s paperwork, and that he knows workers will reliably line up at his door looking for openings every morning.

Pourquoi emigrated from Belgium 37 years ago and said he understands his workers’ desire for more job security. But he also said that more needs to be done to stop the flow of immigration at the southern border, and that the government is responsible for opening pathways to citizenship that would make economic security more certain. As for his business, if stricter immigration policies slashed his workforce and he had to raise wages to $15 an hour, he wouldn’t be able to compete against foreign firms with cheaper wholesale prices.

“If I was a poor Mexican, I would be the first one to cross the Rio Grande illegally myself,” he said. “I don’t blame these people. I blame our politicians and our government for letting it happen.”"
Mar 06 2024,Iowa Senate passes immigration bill that allows deportations,Radio Iowa,center,https://radioiowa.com/2024/03/06/iowa-senate-passes-immigration-bill-that-allows-deportations,"The Iowa Senate passed a bill along party lines that would authorize law enforcement in the state to arrest immigrants who are here illegally and empower Iowa judges to order deportations.

Under the bill it would become a state crime for a person to enter the state if they were already deported or refused entry into the U.S. Republican Senator Jeff Reichman of Montrose, says the state must step in because the Biden administration has allowed record numbers of illegal border crossings. “They refuse to enforce the laws,” he says. Democrats opposed the bill. They say immigration is a federal issue and it would be unconstitutional for the state to get involved with arresting and removing people from the country.

Democratic Senator Janice Weiner of Iowa City says it would be unconstitutional for the state to take over enforcement of immigration laws. She says if GOP Senators want to change border policies they should lobby the state’s federal delegation to support the bipartisan deal that stalled in Congress. “Get them to bring the compromise to the floor and vote for it,” she says. Republican supporters say lax border enforcement is a threat to Iowa. They blame it for the high levels of fentanyl and other drugs confiscated in traffic stops on Iowa interstates.

The bill is similar to a Texas law the U-S Supreme Court has put on hold.

A federal judge in Texas is temporarily blocking a contentious Texas law seeking to make entry into the state by migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border a state crime.

The order comes as immigration is shaping up to be a top issue in the upcoming presidential election, and both President Trump and President Biden are at the southern border on Thursday.

Texas’ Senate Bill 4 would allow police to arrest migrants and state judges to order their deportation, and it was set to go into effect on Tuesday. It is one of multiple battles between Texas and the Biden administration, as Governor Abbott says Texas is being invaded by migrants and has the sovereign right to defend itself in the absence of the federal government enforcing border security.

The Biden administration has argued that entry and removal of noncitizens is an issue that is strictly within the federal government’s purview, citing the Supreme Court ruling in Arizona v. United States in 2012.

On Thursday, a senior federal district judge appointed by President Reagan, David Ezra, expressed concerns that Texas’ law was unconstitutional.

The order halting Texas’ law cites the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent that affirms “that states may not exercise immigration enforcement power except as authorized by the federal government.” Texas’ SB 4 also conflicts with federal immigration law to the “detriment of the United States’ foreign relations and treaty obligations,” the order adds.

The judge also expressed skepticism of Mr. Abbott’s invasion claims.

“Surges in immigration do not constitute an ‘invasion’ within the

meaning of the Constitution, nor is Texas engaging in war by enforcing SB 4,” the judge notes. “To allow Texas to permanently supersede federal directives on the basis of an invasion would amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.”

Mr. Abbott said on Thursday that the decision was expected. He is promising to appeal it and says the case will go to the Supreme Court.

“Texas has the constitutional right to defend itself because of President Biden’s ongoing failure to fulfill his duty,” he wrote on X after the order halting SB 4. “We will not back down in our fight to protect Texas.”

Texas has transported more than 104,000 migrants to sanctuary cities including New York, Chicago, and Denver. Mr. Abbott has repeatedly promised to fight illegal immigration through multiple tactics — including adding razor wire barriers, deploying the National Guard, and building a wall at the border — and says he will use every tool at his disposal, as the Sun has reported.

Federal data obtained by CBS this month show that migrant crossings into Texas have plummeted to the single digits in some areas from thousands of daily crossings, as the National Guard fortified many areas of the border. Migrants are increasingly heading to Arizona and California where there are accessible border gaps, and crossings have surged in those states, data show.

Texas’ law has faced legal and public backlash, especially from immigration advocacy groups who say it’s a waste of taxpayer money and will harm minorities, as the Sun has reported.

Yet, some legal observers have previously told the Sun that SB 4 is constitutional and that the federal government only has exclusive authority over making citizens, not all immigration matters.

“The reality is that states retain plenary powers over all persons, not just citizens, within their jurisdiction under the Tenth Amendment,” the Texas Public Policy Foundation chief of intelligence and research, Joshua Treviño, told the Sun when the law was initially being considered in October.

The Supreme Court in the Arizona case “essentially for the first time in American history completely rejected the states from anything having to do with the adjudication of legal status within borders,” he added."
Feb 28 2024,Breaking Down the Immigration Figures,FactCheck.org,left,https://www.factcheck.org/2024/02/breaking-down-the-immigration-figures/,"Encounters on the southern border of those trying to enter the U.S. without authorization have gone up significantly under President Joe Biden. Government statistics show that in the initial processing of millions of encounters, 2.5 million people have been released into the U.S. and 2.8 million have been removed or expelled.

Some Republicans, however, have misleadingly suggested the number released into the country since Biden took office is much higher.

Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, claimed last month that 8 million “have come in illegally” and “we have to send them back.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made the same claim in a GOP debate in January.

Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas said on “Fox News Sunday” on Feb. 11 that Biden had “allowed an invasion to occur at our border, almost 10 million migrants have crossed into our country.”

The same day on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said that, conservatively, “3.3 million people have been released into the country who arrived here illegally.” But he also claimed that Biden had a policy of releasing “virtually 85, 90% of any migrant that crossed the border,” a percentage that would translate to well more than 3.3 million.

Other Republicans have said 85% of migrants crossing illegally are being released, a figure that reportedly, according to the Border Patrol Union, was used by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in early January. The 85% figure is close to accurate for apprehensions by Border Patrol for one month — December — but statistics for other months or Biden’s time in office are much lower, as we’ll explain later.

DHS has released several spreadsheets of data on illegal immigration at the southern border. All of the figures in this story come from that data from the Office of Homeland Security Statistics, unless otherwise noted.

The statistics can be confusing, and a little messy. For one, the number of apprehensions at the border includes people who have tried to cross more than once. In fiscal year 2021, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to the most recent figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That’s up from just 7% in fiscal 2019, which was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the pandemic, the U.S. used Title 42, a public health law, to immediately expel border-crossers, but without any criminal consequences — a policy that likely incentivized repeated attempts to enter the country. Biden stopped the use of Title 42 in May, when the federal public health emergency for COVID-19 ended. And since then, the recidivism rate has dropped; it was 11% in August, according to CBP.

Another issue with the DHS data is that immigration cases can take years to make their way through court backlogs. The figures on what happens when migrants have come to the border reflect the initial dispositions, as DHS calls them. In many cases, the final decision on whether a migrant will be allowed to stay or will be deported comes later. The information “does not necessarily reflect final dispositions or removals in all cases,” U.S. Border Patrol says on its website.

“This idea of how many people have been released into the country, how many people have been removed – it’s hard to know for sure, because these are initial dispositions,” Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, an associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that researches immigration issues, told us. Many people haven’t had their day in immigration court, she said, so the ultimate results won’t be known until their cases are decided.

Comprehensive figures are available through October. So to keep things as simple as possible, we’ll present numbers for February 2021, the month after Biden took office, through October, unless otherwise noted.

The DHS data show 6.5 million encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border in that time frame, a figure that includes both the 5.8 million apprehensions between legal ports of entry – the number typically used for illegal immigration – and a little more than 700,000 migrants who arrived at ports of entry without authorization to enter the U.S.

Of those 6.5 million encounters by CBP, 2.5 million people have been released into the U.S. with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the future, or other classifications, such as parole.

There are certainly others who have crossed the border by evading the authorities. DHS estimated there were 660,000 “gotaways,” or unlawful entries, in fiscal 2021. The agency would not provide an updated estimate. However, a DHS spokesperson told us: “Under this Administration, the estimated annual apprehension rate has averaged 78%, identical to the rate of the prior Administration.” That rate would support a gotaway figure of 1.6 million from February 2021 through October.

The 1.6 million figure would bring the number of those entering or released into the country to about 4.2 million.

The figures used by Haley, DeSantis and Cotton — 8 million or 10 million — are totals of all migrant encounters at the border plus gotaways, and, in Cotton’s case, encounters at the northern border, coastal borders and airports. Cotton’s press secretary, Patrick McCann, told us that those figures showed the senator was correct to say that number “crossed into the country.” But these claims ignore that DHS statistics show 2.8 million of the encounters at the southern border alone resulted in a removal or expulsion directly from CBP custody, and all of the rest of the migrants encountered are not simply released.

Most of those removals – nearly 2.5 million — were immediate expulsions under Title 42.

Total DHS repatriations through October amounted to 3.7 million, a figure that includes the 2.8 million removals directly from CBP, as well as removals by ICE. CBP operates at the border – at ports of entry and between them — while ICE “is responsible for interior enforcement and for detention and removal operations,” DHS explains.

“The majority of all individuals encountered at the southwest border over the past three years have been removed, returned, or expelled,” a DHS official told us. The total DHS repatriations of 3.7 million would support that. The figure is 57% of the 6.5 million total encounters. The one caveat is that the total repatriations could include some migrants who were apprehended crossing the border some time ago and later were arrested and removed by ICE.

We’ll explain what happens when migrants arrive at the border and provide more information on these statistics.

The Border Process

We reached out to the Migration Policy Institute to ask what happens to migrants who arrive at the southern border without authorization to enter the U.S. “The short answer is, it depends,” Putzel-Kavanaugh told us.

We’ll start with migrants apprehended while trying to cross between ports of entry.

In the last several years, Putzel-Kavanaugh said, typically migrants will go into U.S. territory and then wait to be apprehended, with the intention of asking for asylum. They are taken to a processing center – “large, tent-like structures” – for 24 to 72 hours to answer questions and provide biometric information.

“While in custody,” she said, “they’re processed, so to speak … the appropriate disposition will be given to them.” Migrants could be released with a notice to appear in immigration court, processed for expedited removal or asked if they want to be returned to Mexico.

For expedited removal, the U.S. would have to have a relationship with the migrant’s country of origin and space on a repatriation flight. ICE would need capacity to hold migrants pending removal.

In fiscal year 2023, 46% of encounters were migrants from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras, countries that regularly accept repatriation of their citizens. Venezuelans made up 10.7% of encounters. The U.S. announced in October that Venezuela agreed to accept repatriations of its citizens, but in January, the country halted those flights.

For families, “Border Patrol doesn’t want to keep children in custody for very long,” Putzel-Kavanaugh said. Families are “likely to be released quickly with an NTA [notice to appear] to appear in immigration court.”

What happens for border crossers “depends on the day, depends on how many people Border Patrol is processing” and depends on the type of people coming in, such as whether they are traveling as a family. Criminal record checks are conducted, including screenings for prior immigration charges and whether someone is on a terrorist watchlist.

Glossary of Immigration Enforcement Terms These definitions are from the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and Border Patrol. U.S. Customs and Border Protection – An agency of the Department of Homeland Security that is responsible for securing the homeland by preventing the illegal entry of people and goods while facilitating legitimate travel and trade. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement – The principal investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s primary mission is to promote homeland security and public safety through the criminal and civil enforcement of federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration. U.S. Border Patrol – The mobile, uniformed law enforcement arm of U.S. Customs and Border Protection within the Department of Homeland Security responsible for securing U.S. borders between ports of entry. Alternatives to Detention – Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) program using technology and other tools to manage unauthorized individual’s compliance with release conditions while they are on the non-detained docket. Apprehension – The arrest of a potentially removable noncitizen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Asylee – An alien in the United States or at a port of entry who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of nationality, or to seek the protection of that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Persecution or the fear thereof must be based on religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. Encounters – The sum of U.S. Border Patrol (USBP) Title 8 apprehensions, Office of Field Operations (OFO) Title 8 inadmissibles, and noncitizens processed for expulsions under Title 42 authority by USBP or OFO. Notice to Appear (NTA) – Form I-862, a document that is the first step in starting removal proceedings under Section 240 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The form identifies the grounds for removal under which the noncitizen is being charged and instructs them to appear before an immigration judge. Notice to Report (NTR) – Form I-385, a document that directs an individual to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office within 60 days for further immigration processing. Parole – The discretionary decision that allows inadmissible aliens to leave an inspection facility freely so that, although they are not admitted to the United States, they are permitted to be physically present in the United States. Parole is granted on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. Parole, humanitarian – Parole authorized for “urgent humanitarian reasons” as specified by law, regulation, or declaration by the U.S. government. Port of entry (POE) – Any location in the United States or its territories that is designated as a port of entry (POE) for noncitizens and U.S. citizens. Prosecutorial discretion – The legal authority to choose whether or not to take action against an individual for committing an offense. Title 42 – Title 42 of the United States Code, which includes provisions related to public health. Border encounters processed under a March 2020 Centers for Disease Control (CDC) order pursuant to Title 42 are expelled from the United States as expeditiously as possible in the interest of U.S. public health to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease. Title 8 – Title 8 of the United States Code, which includes most provisions for immigration enforcement. Encounters processed under Title 8 authority may be subject to removal from the United States.

The process at legal ports of entry is different. Most migrants without authorization to enter the U.S. who are processed at ports of entry have appointments through CBP One — an app that in January 2023 began accepting appointments for a limited number of migrants who are in Mexico and want to request asylum or parole. DHS calls this “safer, humane, and more orderly” than processing between ports of entry, where migrants cross the border illegally and wait to be apprehended. Migrants with CBP One appointments get a similar screening and could be subject to expedited removal, but the majority are released into the U.S. with a notice to appear in immigration court, Putzel-Kavanaugh said.

With CBP One, border officers already have a lot of information about the person, including contact information and a photo. But appointments are capped at 1,450 per day. For calendar year 2023, 413,300 people scheduled such appointments, CBP says.

So, those who are released into the U.S. are generally saying they have a fear of returning to their home countries and want to apply for asylum, and releases are especially likely if it involves a family.

The capacity of Border Patrol and ICE facilities is also an issue, with detention reserved “for people who are really presenting a national security threat,” Putzel-Kavanaugh said.

There’s also a humanitarian parole program for people fleeing Haiti, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, who can potentially stay in the U.S. for two years if they have a sponsor who applies for the program. Through the end of last year, 327,000 people have been granted parole under the program, which launched in October 2022 for Venezuelans and expanded to the other nationalities in January 2023. There are 30,000 slots per month available.

Unaccompanied children are transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for children who cross the border on their own.

“It’s this giant puzzle of different agencies … that have to work together,” Putzel-Kavanaugh told us.

For a visualization of the process, the American Immigration Council referred us to a New York Times infographic it helped the newspaper create on what happens to those coming to the border.

Those seeking asylum must prove “that they meet the definition of a refugee,” the American Immigration Council explains in a fact sheet updated in January. “In order to be granted asylum, an individual is required to provide evidence demonstrating either that they have suffered persecution on account of a protected ground in the past, and/or that they have a ‘well-founded fear’ of future persecution in their home country.”

Because of a backlog of cases, asylum seekers can spend years waiting for a court date. As we explained in a story last month, less than 15% of those seeking asylum were ultimately granted it in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, according to Justice Department statistics. But it is taking four to five years for asylum cases to get to court.

The immigration court backlog was 3 million cases in November, a record, according to a December report from TRAC, a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University.

Border Statistics

As we said, there were 6.5 million encounters at the southern border from February 2021 through October, including a little more than 700,000 migrants who arrived without legal documentation at ports of entry. That’s according to DHS’ Office of Homeland Security Statistics.

About 2.5 million people through October have been released into the U.S. That figure includes 2 million released by Border Patrol, with a notice to appear in court or a notice to report to ICE, or released through prosecutorial discretion or granted parole, which allows people into the country for a temporary period. The 2.5 million number also includes nearly 534,000 paroles processed at legal ports of entry.

In addition to those releases, nearly 367,000 migrants have been transferred to HHS, which is responsible for children who cross the border on their own, unaccompanied by adult family members or legal guardians.

Another 771,000 were transferred to ICE, a figure that includes those subsequently booked into ICE custody, enrolled in “alternatives to detention” (which include technological monitoring and other case management options) or released by ICE.

Of those arriving at the southern border during Biden’s presidency, 2.8 million were removed or returned directly from CBP custody through October, the vast majority of them under the Title 42 public health law during the pandemic. Total DHS repatriations were 3.7 million, which includes removals by ICE.

Under Title 42, the U.S. immediately expelled people encountered at the border, except for unaccompanied children, without giving them an opportunity to apply for asylum — and without imposing criminal penalties. Now that Title 42 has ended, there are fewer expulsions overall, but the number removed from CBP custody under Title 8 has increased. Title 8 laws are the longstanding immigration laws that dictate what can happen to migrants entering illegally and who is inadmissible. Title 8 removals are subject to criminal penalties, including a five-year ban on entering the U.S. again.

In addition to fewer expulsions since the end of Title 42, there is evidence of a decline in the rate and number of gotaways, according to David J. Bier, the associate director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. “Since Title 42 was terminated, successful evasions of Border Patrol have declined 79 percent to a daily average of about 500, or 15,500 per month, in January 2024,” Bier wrote, using monthly estimates reported by media outlets.

The gotaway figures can be estimated through observation – such as electronic surveillance of the border – or statistical modeling. “Gotaway data have become more reliable over the past decade because border surveillance has increased dramatically from 2005 to 2023,” Bier wrote.

As we said, some Republicans have claimed that 85% of migrants are being allowed into the country under Biden, citing remarks attributed to DHS Secretary Mayorkas by the Border Patrol Union. (Publicly, Mayorkas said at the time that “the majority of all southwest border migrant encounters throughout this administration have been removed, returned, or expelled.”) But overall under Biden, through October, 35% of those apprehended at the border have been released to await further immigration processing.

Recent Customs and Border Protection figures of those trying to enter the country between ports of entry come close to that 85% number for December, when 77% of the nearly 250,000 apprehensions by Border Patrol were released with a notice to appear in court. But the monthly figures vary. In January, 57% were released with a notice to appear. From June, the first full month after Title 42 ended, through January, 64% of Border Patrol apprehensions were released.

Again, these initial dispositions don’t indicate what ultimately happens.

DHS also publishes lifecycle reports on what happens to migrants over time — since asylum cases and deportation proceedings can take years. The most recent report is for fiscal 2021, which covers less than a year of Biden’s time in office. The latest report shows that cases can be pending for quite some time. It says that 28% of all border encounters from fiscal 2013 to 2021 were still being processed.

Bier calculated release and removal rates for the last two years of former President Donald Trump’s term and the first 26 months of Biden’s, using DHS data, including the lifecycle report, ICE detention statistics and other figures published by the Republican majority on the House Judiciary Committee. Bier wrote in November that his work showed the Biden administration “has removed a higher percentage of arrested border crossers in its first two years than the Trump DHS did over its last two years. Moreover, migrants were more likely to be released after a border arrest under President Trump than under President Biden.”

While the raw numbers are much higher under Biden — 5 million encounters compared with 1.4 million under Trump in those time frames — the percentages for the two administrations were similar: 47% removed under Trump and 51% under Biden. Bier’s estimates are for illegal immigration between ports of entry. (As our bar graph above shows, both administrations had removal rates above 50% when Title 42 was being used to expel people.)

“These numbers highlight how difficult it was even for the most determined administration in US history to expel everyone who enters illegally,” Bier wrote.

Mar 16 2024,"Governor Murphy Says ""No Secret Sauce"" as Immigration Crisis Looms",Shore News Network,center,https://shorenewsnetwork.com/2024/03/16/governor-murphy-says-no-secret-sauce-as-immigration-crisis-looms,"



TRENTON, NJ – New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy recently touted his record on immigration and the Garden State’s status as a bonafide sanctuary state.

This week, New York City Mayor Adams said the city will soon enforce tighter restrictions on housing illegal migrants. Those migrants will be sent elsewhere under the city’s new budget.

Across the Hudson, displaced migrants in New York City could make the trek across another river to find sanctuary, and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has been offering it since taking office.

Murphy has previously said no other state has done more for the immigrant population than New Jersey. He said that after the Afghanistan withdrawal and subsequent refugee crisis, the state took in thousands of refugees at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, working closely with the Biden administration and the federal government.





“It was absolutely flawless,” Murphy said.

When it comes to the current influx of migrants, Murphy has changed his tune.

“There’s no scenario, sadly that I see that’s similar in this case,” Murphy said. “And if I’m right, and I believe I am, sadly, it is beyond us. I don’t want lead folks on to think there’s a secret sauce that we can figure this out.”

Murphy has been criticized by his opponents who are now calling his stance on migrants hypocritical after the Biden Administration announced it could send thousands of illegal migrants to the Atlantic City airport, according to reports release late in 2023.

There is no update on that plan at this time.

The governor denounced the move saying New Jersey can’t handle the influx of migrants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the migrant crisis will “destroy New York City” earlier this week."

A state Senate leader said Wednesday his chamber would not take up the bill because of its potential for unintended consequences. (Caleb McCullough/Gazette-Lee Des Moines Bureau)

DES MOINES — Two Republican bills relating to immigration enforcement in Iowa were halted this week after they failed to garner support from fellow statehouse Republicans.

An Iowa House Republican bill that would have created a new state crime of human smuggling and penalized individuals who transport or harbor undocumented immigrants in some cases — a proposal that was opposed by advocates for charities and shelters — was stopped in the Republican-led Iowa Senate.

And an Iowa Senate bill that would have required businesses to use the E-Verify program to ensure all employees are legal U.S. residents — which was opposed by business groups — will not advance in the Republican-led Iowa House.

The Republicans who chair the Iowa House and Iowa Senate judiciary committees confirmed the proposals’ legislative deaths Wednesday.

Rep. Steve Holt, a Republican from Denison who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, said a significant concern he had with the E-Verify proposal is that on a second offense it would have revoked a business’ license to operate in Iowa.

“That doesn’t seem like a reasonable approach,” Holt told reporters Wednesday.

The E-Verify bill, Senate File 108, earlier this year passed the Iowa Senate on a 30-17 vote, with only Republicans supporting it.

“There’s also people concerned that E-Verify puts an additional burden on business. There’s also concerns that E-Verify doesn’t necessarily do what people believe that it does in terms of verifying (a worker’s) legitimate right to be employed,” Holt added. “Those are the concerns that I have over on my side.”

State Sen. Brad Zaun, a Republican from Urbandale who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the potential for unintended consequences was the chief concern for the House-passed human smuggling bill.

He said Wednesday the Senate will not take up a House-passed bill that sought to strengthen immigration enforcement in Iowa because of the bill’s potential for unintended consequences. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)

“There was some unintended consequences with the bill. And it needed work. So that’s why I pulled the bill,” Zaun told reporters. “In the (bill’s) language, it was my interpretation, as well as some of the people on the committee, that there was some unintended consequences.”

Advocates had expressed concern that the bill could penalize charities and shelters that attempt to aid immigrants. Those advocates said they do not always know an immigrant’s legal status before offering them help.

House Republicans had attempted to address those concerns by placing in the bill language that said arrests could not be made at a church, shelter or school. And Holt said he had expressed a willingness to amend the bill to make the language more palatable to Senate Republicans.

The bill, House File 2608, passed the House last week on a 60-32 vote with only Republican support. The bill also prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving public assistance; that prohibition is already in federal law.

Holt said he found it “deeply concerning” that the bill did not advance in the Senate and said he will consider adding the language to another immigration-related bill that still is eligible for consideration.

“The bottom line is our law enforcement needs to have tools — when ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) refuses to cooperate — to be able to deal with human smuggling and the trafficking that’s going on coming from the invasion on our southern border,” Holt said. “I’m extremely disappointed that they chose not to advance that legislation.”

Hours after the Justice Department asked the high court to intervene, the court blocked the Texas immigration law from going into effect until next week. The high court also requested a response from the state by Monday.

The emergency request came after a federal appeals court over the weekend stayed U.S. District Judge David Ezra's sweeping rejection of the law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who for months has unveiled a series of escalating measures on the border that have tested the boundaries of how far a state can go keep migrants from entering the country.

The law was set to take effect Saturday unless the Supreme Court intervened. The Justice Department told the court that the law would profoundly alter “the status quo that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.”

It went on to argue that the law would have “significant and immediate adverse effects” on the country’s relationship with Mexico and “create chaos” in enforcing federal immigration laws in Texas.

The federal government cited a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on an Arizona law that would have allowed police to arrest people for federal immigration violations, often referred to by opponents as the “show me your papers” bill. The divided high court found that the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion.

In a statement Monday, the Texas Attorney General's Office said the Texas law mirrored federal law and “was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else.”

In a 114-page ruling Thursday, Ezra rebuked Texas’ immigration enforcement and brushed off claims by Republicans about an ongoing “invasion” along the southern border due to record-high illegal crossings.

Ezra added that the law violates the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, conflicts with federal immigration law and could get in the way of U.S. foreign relations and treaty obligations.

According to Ezra's ruling, allowing Texas to supersede federal law due to an “invasion” would “amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.”

Under Texas law, state officers can arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody, people arrested can agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged with a more serious felony.

Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants already living in the U.S. because the two-year statute of limitations on the illegal entry charge would be enforced only along the state’s border with Mexico.

Texas has been arresting migrants for years under a different program that is based on criminal trespass arrests.

Though Ezra said some might sympathize with Texas officials' concerns about immigration enforcement by the federal government, he said that was not enough to excuse a violation of the U.S. Constitution.

The battle over the Texas immigration law, known as Senate Bill 4, is one of multiple legal disputes between Texas officials and the Biden Administration over how far the state can go to patrol the Texas-Mexico border and prevent illegal border crossings.

Several Republican governors have backed Abbott's efforts, saying the federal government is not doing enough to enforce existing immigration laws.

Some of Abbott's attempts to impede illegal border crossings have included a floating barrier in the Rio Grande— which Ezra previously blocked and is part of an ongoing legal battle— and placing razor wire along the state's boundary with Mexico. State guard officers have also blocked U.S. Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park in Eagle Pass that was previously used by federal agents to process migrants."
Mar 12 2024,U.S. Supreme Court will rule on Texas' immigration law on March 18,El Paso Matters,center,https://elpasomatters.org/2024/03/12/sb4-gov-abbott-migrants-texas-law-u-s-supreme-court,"BY URIEL J. GARCÍA AND WILLIAM MELHADO

The U.S. Supreme Court on March 12 said it will continue to temporarily block a new state law that allows Texas police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the Texas-Mexico border.

Justice Samuel Alito extended his stay until March 18.

The nation’s highest court is overruling a decision from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that would have allowed police to start enforcing Senate Bill 4 on March 9.

That 5th Circuit ruling came just a day after U.S. District Judge David Ezra in Austin blocked SB 4 from going into effect, saying the law “threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice.”

Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB 4 in December, marking Texas’ latest attempt to try to deter people from crossing the Rio Grande after several years of historic numbers of migrants arriving at the Texas-Mexico border.

SB 4 seeks to make illegally crossing the border a Class B misdemeanor, carrying a punishment of up to six months in jail. Repeat offenders could face a second-degree felony with a punishment of two to 20 years in prison.

The law also requires state judges to order migrants returned to Mexico if they are convicted; local law enforcement would be responsible for transporting migrants to the border. A judge could drop the charges if a migrant agrees to return to Mexico voluntarily.

In December, ​​the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project sued Texas on behalf of El Paso County and two immigrant rights organizations — El Paso-based Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Austin-based American Gateways — over the new state law. The following month, the U.S. Department of Justice filed its lawsuit against Texas. The lawsuits have since been combined.

The court proceedings come during a presidential election year when immigration has been top of mind for many voters. Former President Donald Trump has bashed President Joe Biden for his immigration policies, saying he has incentivized illegal immigration. Biden has created some narrow paths for migrants to enter the U.S. legally with policies that seek to deter migrants from entering the country illegally."
Mar 04 2024,US Supreme Court delays Texas immigration law,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/5/supreme-court-temporarily-blocks-law,"The law, known as Senate Bill 4, had been set to take effect on Saturday and it would allow state officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country irregularly.

A United States Supreme Court judge has temporarily blocked a bill that would hand authorities in Texas draconian powers to arrest and expel migrants and refugees who enter the country without documents.

An order issued on Monday by Justice Samuel Alito puts the legislation on hold until at least next week, when the court is set to examine it again.

Opponents have called the measures, which would give state officials broad powers to arrest, prosecute and order the removal of people who cross the border from Mexico irregularly, the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since an Arizona law more than a decade ago.

Known as Senate Bill 4, the law had been set to take effect on Saturday under a decision by the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals. Alito’s order pushes that back to March 13. The delay came just hours after the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to intervene.

“Make no mistake: S.B. 4 bypasses federal immigration authority and threatens the integrity of our nation’s constitution and laws,” a coalition of groups that took legal action against the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement.

Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the law in December as part of a series of escalating measures on the border that have tested the boundaries of how far a state can go to keep migrants from entering the country.

The legislation would allow state officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. People who are arrested could then agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanour charge.

Those who fail to leave after being ordered to do so could be rearrested and charged with a more serious felony.

‘Ongoing crisis at the southern border’

The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the law would profoundly alter “the status quo that has existed between the United States and the States in the context of immigration for almost 150 years.”

It went on to argue that the law would have “significant and immediate adverse effects” on the country’s relationship with Mexico and “create chaos” in enforcing federal immigration laws in Texas.

The federal government cited a 2012 Supreme Court ruling on an Arizona law that would have allowed police to arrest people for federal immigration violations, often referred to by opponents as the “show me your papers” bill.

The divided high court found that the impasse in Washington over immigration reform did not justify state intrusion.

The Supreme Court gave Texas until March 11 to respond.

In a statement, the Texas Attorney General’s Office said the bill mirrors federal law and “was adopted to address the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which hurts Texans more than anyone else”.

The federal government’s emergency request to the Supreme Court came after a federal appeals court over the weekend stayed US District Judge David Ezra’s sweeping rejection of the law.

In a 114-page ruling on Thursday, Ezra rebuked Texas’s immigration enforcement and brushed off claims by Republicans about an ongoing “invasion” along the southern border due to record-high illegal crossings.

Ezra added that the law violates the US Constitution’s supremacy clause, conflicts with federal immigration law and could get in the way of US foreign relations and treaty obligations.

The battle over the Texas immigration law is one of multiple legal disputes between Texas officials and the Biden administration over how far the state can go to patrol the Texas-Mexico border and prevent illegal border crossings.

Several Republican governors have backed Abbott’s efforts, saying the federal government is not doing enough to enforce existing immigration laws."
Mar 07 2024,Virginia voters concerned about illegal immigration — MSNBC laughs,American Thinker,right,https://americanthinker.com/blog/2024/03/virginia_voters_concerned_about_illegal_immigration__msnbc_laughs.html,"A recent MSNBC panel led by Rachel Maddow appeared incredulous that Virginia voters are concerned about illegal immigration and would like to see our borders secured. The diverse all-woman panel yukked it up over the backwardness of the rubes of the Old Dominion. Maddow noted that Virginia does share a border with West Virginia, however, and intimated that perhaps the voters should be more concerned with keeping the deplorable yahoos in that state from entering Virginia.

This was a remarkably repulsive — and public — display of disdain for average Americans, even for the likes of MSNBC, especially considering that illegal immigration now ranks as the number-one concern among Americans overall, for several excellent reasons, expense, crime, and human- and drug-trafficking among them.

It is hard to imagine a group of alleged “journalists” being more out of touch. Given the tone of conversation, it wouldn’t have been surprising to hear Maddow or one of her associates exclaim, “Let them eat cake!”

Sadly, Maddow’s show is quite popular. It is hard to believe there are those who get their “news” from despicable clowns like these.

Feb 23 2024,Biden Tries to Flip the Politics of Immigration,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/23/us/politics/biden-immigration-executive-action.html,"If President Biden moves ahead with a plan to block people who illegally cross into the United States from claiming asylum, it is likely to face a swift legal challenge, much the way an effort by his predecessor in 2018 was blocked by the courts.

Politically, such a setback may not even matter.

For Mr. Biden, simply issuing an executive action just before his State of the Union address on March 7 could bolster his re-election campaign by demonstrating that he is unilaterally trying to secure the border over Republican opposition.

The president’s aides have seized on the decision by Republican lawmakers last month to kill a bipartisan border measure when polls show Americans are deeply concerned about the number of people crossing from Mexico after fleeing gangs, torture and economic distress in Central and South America.

“Folks, doing nothing is not an option,” Mr. Biden told the nation’s governors on Friday during a meeting at the White House, suggesting that they pressure lawmakers to revive the border bill in the days ahead."
Mar 01 2024,"Biden, Trump visit south border, talk immigration",Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2024/mar/01/biden-trump-visit-south-border-talk-immigration,"



BROWNSVILLE, Texas -- On the banks of the same Rio Grande but 300 miles apart, President Joe Biden and GOP challenger Donald Trump on Thursday surveyed the U.S.-Mexico border and tussled from a distance over who is to blame for the nation's broken immigration system and how to fix it.

Immigration has emerged as a central issue in the 2024 presidential campaign, which is widely expected to be a Biden-Trump rematch, and each man is seeking to use the border problems to his own political advantage.

Their itineraries were remarkably similar: They arrived in Texas within a half-hour of one another. Each chose an optimal location from which to make his point, got a briefing on operations and issues, walked along the scrub brush by the Rio Grande and spoke directly to the public. Their remarks even overlapped in time for a bit.

But that's where the parallels ended.

Biden sought to spotlight the necessity of a bipartisan border security bill that was tanked by Republicans on Trump's orders, and flat-out asked the Republican frontrunner to join him in supporting a congressional push for more funding and tighter restrictions.

""Here's what I would say to Mr. Trump,"" Biden said. ""Instead of playing politics with the issue, join me, or I'll join you in telling the Congress to pass this bill. You know and I know it's the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country's ever seen.""

Biden went to the Rio Grande Valley city of Brownsville, which for nine years was the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. The numbers have dropped in recent months, which officials credited in part to Mexico for stepping up its own border security. The visit was a nod to how the Biden administration views migration: as a regional and global issue, not just a U.S. problem.

The president walked along the Rio Grande and received a lengthy briefing from Homeland Security officials, who spoke bluntly about what they needed to do their jobs effectively -- in short, more money to hire more officers along the border and for use across the asylum process to help clear out massive backlogs.

""I want the American people to know what we're trying to get done,"" Biden said. ""We can't afford not to do this.""

Trump simply blamed Biden.

He traveled to Eagle Pass, roughly 325 miles northwest of Brownsville, in the corridor that's currently seeing the largest number of migrant crossings. He met with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and Texas National Guard soldiers who have commandeered a local park and put up razor wire fencing at the river's edge to keep migrants from crossing illegally. The park has become a Republican symbol of defiance against the federal government.

""This is like a war,"" Trump said.

Gazing out over the river, Trump raised his fist and waved and shouted to people on the Mexico side, who waved back. Then, he declared that migrants arriving to the border were criminals and some were terrorists, a dialed-up version of the accusations he often used during the 2016 campaign. This time, he's started to harness rhetoric once used by Adolf Hitler to argue migrants are poisoning the blood of America.

""They're being let into our country and it's horrible,"" Trump said. ""It's horrible.""

Trump also brought up the killing of a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia recently. The suspect is a Venezuelan migrant.

""Crooked Joe has the blood of countless innocent victims,"" Trump said. ""It's so many stories to tell, so many horrible stories.""

Despite Trump's claims, many studies have found immigrants are less drawn to violent crime than native-born citizens. One published by the National Academy of Sciences, based on Texas Department of Public Safety data from 2012 to 2018, reported native-born U.S. residents were more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes as people in the country illegally.

As the politicians traded barbs over who was to blame, migrants were still making the dangerous journey into the U.S. Trump stood on a concrete boat launch where a day earlier, a man had been pulled from the river, drowned, trying to cross. In Brownsville where Biden spoke, a group of migrants had crossed illegally overnight.

Across the border from Brownsville, in Matamoros, makeshift shelters dotted the ground for migrants who hope to come to the U.S.

""I come completely alone on this journey, I have been on this journey for about six months and the only important thing I have in my life are my mom, my little sister and nobody else,"" Joseph Elián Gutierrez Castillo, a Nicaraguan migrant, said in Spanish. ""With God's favor everything will go well.""

The number of people who are illegally crossing the U.S. border has been rising for years, for reasons that include climate change, war and unrest in other nations, the economy, and cartels that see migration as a cash cow.

Migrants can ask for asylum whether they come illegally or through ports of entry; in some cases they are turned away because of current policies, but many families are allowed into the U.S., where they often wait years for a court date to determine whether they can stay.

The administration's approach has been to pair crackdowns at the border with increasing legal pathways for migrants designed to steer people into arriving by plane with sponsors, not illegally on foot to the border. The numbers of migrants flowing across the U.S-Mexico border have far outpaced the capacity of an immigration system that has not been substantially updated in decades.

Arrests for illegal crossings fell by half in January, but there were record highs in December.

Since the president was last at the border a year ago, the debate over immigration in Washington has shifted further to the right, with Democrats increasingly eager to embrace border restrictions now that migrants are sleeping in police stations and airplane hangars in major U.S. cities.

During bipartisan talks on the deal that would have toughened access for migrants and funded enforcement and immigration court, Biden himself said he'd be willing to ""shut down the border"" right now, should the deal pass.

The talks looked promising for a while. But Trump, who didn't want to give Biden a political win on one of his signature campaign issues, convinced Republicans to kill the deal. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared the deal dead on arrival.

Republicans claim Biden has the power he needs to fix the issue, but absent legislative action, any major policy changes are likely to be challenged or held up in court. Under Trump, too, new hardline policies were often held up in court.

Among voters, worries about the nation's broken immigration system are rising on both sides of the political divide, which could be especially problematic for Biden.

According to an AP-NORC poll in January, the share of voters concerned about immigration rose from 27% to 35% last year. Fifty-five percent of Republicans say the government needs to focus on immigration in 2024, while 22% of Democrats listed immigration as a priority. That's up from 45% and 14%, respectively, from December 2022.

Trump has laid out updated immigration proposals that would mark a dramatic escalation of the approach he used in office and that drew alarms from civil rights activists and numerous court challenges.

Some of those include reviving and expanding a travel ban, imposing ""ideological screening"" for migrants, terminating all work permits and cutting off funding for shelter and transportation for people who are in the country illegally.

Mar 04 2024,Appeals Court Stays Block on Texas Latest Immigration Law,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/border/2024/03/04/appeals-court-stays-block-on-texas-latest-immigration-law,"The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a temporary stay of a lower court order blocking the implementation of a newly enacted Texas law that would allow for the prosecution of migrants illegally entering the state. The new law provides a mechanism for the State of Texas to remove migrants from the country.

The temporary order, issued on Saturday by the federal appeals court will allow the law to be enforced after seven days if the U.S. Supreme Court does not intercede.

Last week, Austin’s senior U.S. District Judge David Ezra halted the implementation of Senate Bill 4, which was to take effect on March 5, citing the federal government’s supremacy over the enforcement of immigration laws. In his decision, Ezra stated “For the past century, Texas has relied on its expansive police powers afforded to it under the Constitution to regulate crime within its borders. Texas may continue to do so, but I cannot regulate the federal field of unlawful entry and removal.”

Texas filed an appeal of Ezra’s ruling on the matter leading up to Saturday’s federal appeals court ruling, granting a seven-day hold barring enforcement of the law to allow the Biden Administration to elevate the matter to the United States Supreme Court.

Absent intervention by the Supreme Court, the law will go into effect upon the conclusion of the pause on March 9.

Texas SB4 is similar to a current federal statute under Title 8 of the United States Code 1325, which makes illegal entry into the United States a misdemeanor offense for a first-time offender and a felony for a second offense. Under the Biden administration, the federal statute is not pursued to any significant degree.

Under the new law, migrants may agree to return to their home country as part of sentencing agreements. A similar process in federal courts is known as Stipulated Removal, where a migrant may waive their right to a separate administrative immigration hearing agreeing to removal from the United States as part of the sentencing process.

The State also increased penalties for other immigration offenses normally reserved to the federal government. The Texas Legislature passed bills, signed by Abbott, that created a mandatory ten-year minimum prison sentence for smuggling of persons and continuous smuggling of persons. That law enhances the criminal penalties for operating a stash house and creates a mandatory five-year minimum prison sentence. It also further enhances criminal penalties for victim-related offenses that occurred during the commission of smuggling, such as assault and burglary.

The latest ruling will likely face review by the Supreme Court which struck down a similar state law in Arizona. In a 2010 law signed by then Governor Jan Brewer, Arizona attempted to make illegal presence by a migrant and a migrant’s unlawful employment in the state a misdemeanor crime. Justice Kennedy ruled in the majority opinion that these two provisions of SB 1070 infringed upon the supremacy of the federal government to regulate and enforce immigration laws.

One of the proposals would require businesses to use the federal e-verify program to check if an employee can legally work in the U.S.

""When Tyson started using e-verify, undocumented immigrants flocked to hog farms,"" said a translator for Honduras refugee Ninoska Campos. ""Who will feed and water the pigs if we are unable to work?""

""It is so important that we recognize the true value and eliminate some of the hate and misunderstanding that's occurring, mainly because of politics today,"" said State Sen Bill Dotzler (D) Waterloo.

The e-verify bill has already passed through committee.

Subcommittees have already green-lit a couple other bills. One of them would make it a crime for deportees to come back to Iowa. Another would make it a felony to help undocumented immigrants, something opponents argue could put nurses and social workers in legal jeopardy.

Mar 13 2024,"Coffman: Aurora police enforce local laws, not immigration laws, and our resolution doesn’t change that",The Denver Post,center,https://denverpost.com/2024/03/13/aurora-coffman-sanctuary-city-immigration-laws-police,"The recent Denver Post editorial reiterated a tired, old, inaccurate trope that Aurora’s police department “will check the immigration status of people and tell ICE what it wants and needs to know for potential deportation cases.” This is patently wrong and misleading.

Aurora police officers enforce state and municipal laws, not federal laws. The city has repeated this message for many years. Immigration law is a federal responsibility.

The recent resolution passed by City Council does not change that. Someone’s immigration status is immaterial to our police officers. Our officers work to build positive relationships with our immigrant communities and regularly encourage anyone – irrespective and without knowledge of their immigration status – to contact the Aurora Police Department if they are a victim or a witness to crime.

In fact, some of our police officers themselves are immigrants. We recognize that immigrants are particularly vulnerable to crime, and we work hard to build trust among them. Although we don’t enforce federal immigration laws, the resolution affirms that the city of Aurora is not a “sanctuary city,” in that we do not seek to block U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement officials from doing their job by withholding information. Our goal is public safety for all members of the community.

Contrary to the editorial board’s assertions on March 3, the resolution passed by the Aurora City Council on Feb. 26 is about us being good stewards of taxpayer dollars, not demonizing people seeking a better life. To conflate the issues is not only inaccurate but unfair, especially in a community that welcomes residents from across the globe. This is not an either-or situation. We can greatly value our immigrant communities and still not have the resources or be structured to handle the current influx of migrants.

Our duty is to focus limited city resources on delivering essential city services to residents like police, fire, 911, water, transportation infrastructure and maintenance, recreation, and libraries. The resolution simply affirms that the city does not have the financial capacity to fund services related to the migrant crisis and that it expects neighboring municipalities or entities to help foot the bills if they want to bus migrants into Aurora.

It notes that Aurora, as a city, not a city and a county like Denver, does not have public health or human services departments or the professionals and the funding that comes with them. Most importantly, it calls on the federal government to take swift, decisive action to support municipalities around the country that continue to shoulder the enormous burden of this crisis at the expense of their residents.

As our residents and other people across the metro area know, we are exceedingly proud of Aurora’s identity as the most diverse and global city in the state and region. There’s a reason we call Aurora “The World in a City.” We value our immigrant communities greatly and have strong working relationships with each of them. For many years, we have expressed unwavering support for immigration through established immigration channels. We have also maximized our existing resources as efficiently as possible to align with the city’s unique Immigrant and Refugee Integration Plan.

If we can agree on one thing, it is that our elected leaders in Washington, D.C., made this mess, and it is their responsibility to clean it up by passing a comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders and fixes our broken immigration system. Until then, the federal government must assume responsibility for all costs associated with the support of the recently arrived migrants into the Denver metro area and quit making cities like Aurora the scapegoats.

Mike Coffman is the mayor of Aurora.

Feb 28 2024,Bill requires Iowa businesses to verify employee immigration status,Siouxland Proud,center,https://siouxlandproud.com/news/iowa-news/bill-requires-iowa-businesses-to-verify-employee-immigration-status,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa Senate Republicans passed a bill that requires businesses to verify an employee’s immigration status through a federal program.

Senate File 108 passed by a vote of 30-17 on Wednesday afternoon at the Iowa Capitol. The bill requires employers to use the federal E-Verify program, which takes an individual’s employment eligibility form with the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security. The program confirms if the individual is authorized for work in the United States.

“Imagine if you’re an employer and you obey the law. You only hire people that can legally be hired that are here in the country legally. But you’ve got to compete with the guy down the street that’s hiring people who work for cut wages,” said State Senator Julian Garrett, (R) District 11 from Warren County.

The bill allows members of the public to report businesses to Iowa Workforce Development. Senate Democrats are concerned that this type of reporting system will prompt false reports because of racial discrimination.

“Any member of the public to file a complaint with Iowa Workforce Development alleging an employer has hired someone illegally. That may be just because they don’t like how they look, because they see someone brown working on a roof, because they see someone brown working in the fields,” said State Senator Weiner, (D) District 45 from Iowa City.

“Talks about somebody filing false charges. Well, I guess you’ve got that risk with any kind of a law. It doesn’t happen very often in Iowa. Iowans aren’t like that,” said Sen. Garrett.

Sen. Garrett said 5,000 businesses in the state already use the E-Verify program.

The policy also creates penalties for businesses who knowingly hire unauthorized immigrants. Senate Democrats are concerned that the penalties may result in businesses not being able to operate in the state.

“Above all else, above our friends, above our businesses, above our employees, today is the day we send the message. We’re looking for you and we’re going to penalize you. Casey’s, we may run you out of the state of Iowa,” said State Senator Tony Bisignano, (D) District 15 from Des Moines.

Senate Bill 4 was halted by U.S. District Judge David Ezra. When the ruling was announced, Governor Greg Abbott said the state would appeal. Texas did that to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. One day after Judge Ezra's ruling was released, the appeals court immediately paused the district court's ruling.

The new state law allows Texas police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the Texas border with Mexico.

The pause gives Texas seven days to appeal to the Supreme Court. If SCOTUS does not intervene, the new law will go into effect on Saturday, though the legal battle continues. The appeals court also said it will schedule oral arguments on its next available date. That date has not been announced.

Mar 04 2024,Supreme Court temporarily halts Texas law allowing state immigration enforcement,Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/supreme-court-temporarily-halts-texas-law-allowing-state-immigration,"The Supreme Court on Monday imposed a temporary stay on a Texas law permitting state officials to arrest illegal aliens.

Associate Justice Samuel Alito imposed the stay after the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals permitted the law to take effect on March 10, NBC reported. U.S. District Judge David Ezra imposed an initial stay late last month.

Alito's stay come in response to plea from the Biden administration and will remain in effect until March 13. The justice gave Texas until March 11 to respond to the administration.

In issuing the original stay, Ezra argued that the law would permit the Lone Star State to ""permanently supersede federal directives,"" amounting to ""nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.""

Under the Biden administration, Texas has routinely clashed with Washington over Operation Lone Star, its unilateral effort to secure the border in the face of perceived federal apathy toward the unprecedented surge in illegal crossings.

Among the most high-profile dispute have been the state's deployment of a buoy barrier in the Rio Grande river and its construction of concertina-wire fencing along the Mexican frontier to deter illegal entrants.

Immigration Deal Breaks Down in the Senate

GOP Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma talks to reporters as he makes his way to a meeting at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. on February 5, 2024. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)

Consider sparing a thought today for Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma.

After being tasked by his colleagues with one of the hardest jobs in American politics—fixing the country’s broken immigration system—Lankford spent months negotiating with Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona to find a bipartisan compromise. The former president and de facto leader of Lankford’s party came out against the effort before the draft was even finished, leading prominent right-wing commentators to call for his resignation. When the work was finally complete and the negotiators released a 370-page bill, the backlash from his fellow Republicans was so fierce and so quick that Lankford himself is not even sure he’ll vote to advance his own bill today."

On Wednesday, while the House Oversight and Accountability Committee discussed H.R.2, the House GOP's Secure the Border Act, Freshman Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) revealed himself to be a complete moron.

While several Democrats attacked the bill, Frost decided to perform a dramatic diatribe which included a mock bill to remove the Statue of Liberty.

""My colleagues from the other side of the aisle, let’s be honest with immigrants who deserve better than what you’re offering them. Don’t welcome immigrants if you plan to reject them. If you keep pushing your bigoted H.R. 2 bill, then also pass this bill. I’ve taken the liberty of drafting it for you,"" Frost said, holding up the draft.

""It removes the Statue of Liberty, our largest symbol that tells people to come here,"" he continued - apparently unaware that there is a legal immigration process currently being subverted by the those H.R. 2 is aimed at stopping.

Freshman Democrat Rep. Max Frost: Republicans might as well take down the Statue of Liberty if they're going to demand a secure border! 🤔 pic.twitter.com/6yAHno9n7l — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) January 17, 2024

""This is who you are, removing the fabric of America. So, I want to know which Republican, who supports and voted for H.R.2, will introduce this bill,"" Maxwell continued. ""If you’re gonna support H.R.2 and these bigoted measures, the least you can do is not be a damn liar,"" Fox News reports.

The replies were priceless:

Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., was mocked on social media Wednesday for telling Republicans to pass a bill to remove the Statue of Liberty along with their ""bigoted"" immigration law.

A House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing on immigration discussed H.R.2, the House GOP’s Secure the Border Act, the comprehensive border security and immigration bill passed back in May. The bill would restrict the asylum process for people crossing the border and require resumed construction on the border wall.

The freshman congressman was one of many Democrats who attacked the bill, though he also produced a mock bill to remove the Statue of Liberty for Republicans to also pass.

REP. JAYAPAL SHREDDED FOR SAYING BIDEN BORDER ENFORCEMENT 'SO HEAVY-HANDED' SHE HAS 'CONCERNS:' 'OUT OF TOUCH'

""My colleagues from the other side of the aisle, let’s be honest with immigrants who deserve better than what you’re offering them. Don’t welcome immigrants if you plan to reject them. If you keep pushing your bigoted H.R. 2 bill, then also pass this bill. I’ve taken the liberty of drafting it for you,"" Frost said, holding up the draft.

Frost’s reference to the iconic sculpture was blasted for conflating significant immigration reform with text on the Statue of Liberty.

""This is ridiculous,"" The Telegraph contributor Nile Gardiner remarked.

Fox News contributor Guy Benson agreed, ""god this is stupid.""

""Hey! Statue!"" The Spectator contributing editor Stephen Miller joked, pointing out the leftist trope.

""Democrats can’t decide if they want to topple statues or have them make our laws for us,"" writer Ryan James Girdusky posted.

RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway added, ""There’s only one party in this country that wants to tear down statues, and it’s not Republicans.""

Substack writer Jim Treacher noted, ""Eric Adams isn't a Republican. Brandon Johnson isn't a Republican. None of the other mayors crying about immigrants are Republicans.""

""The country's going to hell because people keep electing morons like this,"" Twitchy’s Doug Powers declared.

Maryland State Sen. Justin Ready commented, ""Then I guess New York and Chicago should stop complaining then!""

""You can be for legal immigration and a secure border, its not something we have to choose between,"" Republican State Leadership Committee deputy communications director Mason Di Palma wrote.

Radio host Lori Mills explained, ""He should sponsor a family, and illegal aliens should be sent to his district. It’s the compassionate thing to do. @GovAbbott.""

DEMOCRATS 'DRIVING POLARIZATION' ON IMMIGRATION AMID PARTY'S 'SHIFT LEFTWARD,' POLITICAL SCIENTISTS FIND

The left referring to the Statue of Liberty as equivalent to immigration law has been an often-ridiculed notion by right-wingers. During the Trump administration, cabinet members were asked how the president’s immigration stances squared with the symbolic sculpture.

""The Statue of Liberty says, ‘give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.’ It doesn't say anything about speaking English or being able to be a computer programmer,"" CNN’s Jim Acosta infamously said to then senior White House adviser Stephen Miller in 2017.

Although Frost attacked Republicans, 14 Democratic lawmakers voted with the GOP to condemn President Biden’s border policies. The Democrats included Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas; Jared Golden, D-Maine; Mary Peltola, D-Alaska; Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash.; and Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla.

Jan 08 2024,GOP lawmaker wants government shut down over illegal immigration flood,Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/5/mary-miller-gop-lawmaker-wants-government-shut-dow/,"A Republican lawmaker who visited the southern border with other GOP members in Texas called for a government shutdown over the surge of illegal migrants entering the U.S.

Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois recorded a video of herself, posted Friday on X, standing in front of the concertina wire that Texas authorities unraveled on the U.S. side of the border in Eagle Pass.

“I’m down here at the border with Speaker [Mike] Johnson and some other members. And it is a catastrophe. It is so alarming,” she said.

She wrote, “If [President] Biden won’t shut down the border invasion, Congress must shut down the corrupt government that is funding it!”

Congress is under a tight deadline to fund the federal government. When lawmakers return next week, they have just 10 days to avoid a partial government shutdown, with the first deadline Jan. 19 and the second one Feb. 2.

Mr. Johnson, Louisiana Republican, spearheaded a trip of dozens of House Republicans to the border in Texas on Wednesday, giving them a firsthand look at the devastation of unprecedented illegal immigration and calling the situation “an unmitigated disaster.”

Taking stock of the record-breaking numbers, the lawmakers said they won’t accept any major spending deals on Capitol Hill that don’t put border security first.

As they announced the start of impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, one committee chairman labeled him “the greatest domestic threat to the national security and the safety of the American people.”

Mr. Mayorkas, who appeared on Fox News when the lawmakers were at the border, said of a report that 70% of illegal migrants were often released into the U.S., “It would not surprise me at all. I know the data. And I will tell you that when individuals are released, they are released into immigration enforcement proceedings. They are on alternatives to detention, and we have returned or removed a record number of individuals. We are enforcing the laws that Congress has passed.”

White House spokesman Andrew Bates said Mr. Biden has tried to get Republicans to agree to a major legalization program for illegal immigrants.

“House Republicans have obstructed his reform proposal and consistently voted against his unprecedented border security funding year after year, hamstringing our border security in the name of extreme, partisan demands,” Mr. Bates said.

The numbers show a different picture.

When the Biden administration took office in 2021, Customs and Border Protection was funded at $19.3 billion, according to data from the Congressional Research Service. Mr. Biden proposed cutting $2.9 billion in his first budget, which would have left CBP at $16.4 billion in 2022.

When asked if the administration would accept the extra funding on the condition that the funds could be used only for detention and removal, but not release into the country, Mr. Mayorkas demurred. He replied that the funds were necessary for other DHS resources, including border patrol agents, technology, detention space and immigration judges “so justice can be administered more swiftly.”

Dec 29 2023,DOJ To Sue State Over New Immigration Enforcement Law,East Texas Radio,center,https://easttexasradio.com/doj-to-sue-state-over-new-immigration-enforcement-law,"The U.S. Department of Justice has threatened to sue to stop a new Texas law that allows state and local police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the border unless Gov. Greg Abbott backs off of enforcing the law. Suppose Texas executes the law by next Wednesday, January 3. In that case, the DOJ says it will “pursue all appropriate legal remedies to ensure that Texas does not interfere with the functions of the federal government."
Jan 04 2024,Biden Administration Sues to Stop Texas from Enforcing Immigration Law,Western Journal,not-yet-rated,https://westernjournal.com/biden-administration-attempts-stop-texas-enforcing-immigration-law,"The Biden administration is responding to a Texas-sized challenge to its authority as the state tries to crack down on the flood of illegal immigrants entering it from Mexico.

In December, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a state law that allows Texas police to arrest anyone who entered the state in between ports of entry, according to the Texas Tribune.

The legislation gives illegal immigrants who are arrested by state and local authorities a choice — remain in Texas behind bars, or accept deportation to Mexico. The law makes being in the state illegally a misdemeanor charge with up to a six-month jail sentence. Charges increase for repeat offenders to become felonies — with a sentence of 2 to 20 years — but those can be dropped if the immigrant agrees to be deported.

A court challenge was expected because, as noted by National Review, the most recent Supreme Court ruling on the issue, Arizona v. U.S., says the federal government has the sole power to deport illegal immigrants.

A Department of Justice complaint said “Texas cannot run its own immigration system. Its efforts, through SB 4, intrude on the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States’ immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations. SB 4 is invalid and must be enjoined.”

The complaint demands Texas annul the law before it takes effect on March 5.

The complaint claims that Texas is interfering with a finely-tuned effort to address immigration issues.

“If SB 4 takes effect, it will interfere with federal immigration operations, including the carefully calibrated law-enforcement scheme governing entry and the comprehensive removal scheme, which also includes relief or protection from removal. It will interfere with the exclusive authority of the federal government to control entry into the United States and removal of noncitizens to foreign countries as well as the conduct of foreign relations,” the complaint said.

The complaint said that a process to remove illegal immigrants already exists and that the Texas law is duplicative, while also noting that the federal government has procedures in place to protect illegal immigrants against being deported.

“SB 4 would also impede the federal government’s ability to take appropriate enforcement actions and assess a noncitizen’s national security and public-safety risks,” the complaint said.

The complaint said the law “would interfere with the federal government’s ability to conduct foreign relations by imposing criminal penalties and immigration consequences on foreign nationals based on their entry into the United States.”

“The foreign-relations concerns are exacerbated because the purpose and effect of SB 4 would be to remove noncitizens to Mexico, regardless of their nationality. SB 4 permits state judges and magistrates to order the removal of noncitizens to Mexico, regardless of their country of citizenship, and without any indication that Mexico is willing to accept them, potentially subjecting noncitizens to further criminal penalty if Mexico denies entry,” the complaint said.

The bottom line is that Texas cannot enter into an area where the federal government supersedes the state.

“Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and longstanding Supreme Court precedent, states cannot adopt immigration laws that interfere with the framework enacted by Congress,” Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta said in a statement, according to Axios.

While the Biden administration fumes, Republican state Rep. David Spiller called the bill “a landmark bill that allows Texans to protect Texas,” according to the Houston Chronicle.

“It’s a humane, logical and efficient approach to a problem created and fostered by the Biden administration’s failure and refusal to secure our border,” Spiller said.

“There’s nothing unfair about ordering someone back from where they came if they arrived here illegally,” he said.

Dec 28 2023,Mexico's president discloses agreements reached with U.S. government on immigration,ABC 7 KVIA,center,https://kvia.com/news/2023/12/28/mexicos-president-discloses-agreements-reached-with-u-s-government-on-immigration,"JUAREZ, Chihuahua (KVIA) -- In a Thursday morning news conference, Mexico's president Andrés Manuel López Obrador explained some of the agreements he discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, and White House Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.

President López Obrador said the U.S. government agreed to open and restore the flow of regular and commercial crossings at ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border.

He also mentioned that it is indispensable to keep good relations with the U.S. because more than 40 million Mexican citizens live and work in the U.S. legally. He said this could have negative results on the economic relationships between both countries.

""There is a lot of activity at the border of goods and people. New investments are arriving in Mexico, from around the world, and from the U.S.,"" President López Obrador said.

The migrant caravan that was spotted in South Mexico between 5,000 and 6,000 migrants was also decreased and now it has around 1,500 migrants according to López Obrador."

Jan 04 2024,Biden DOJ sues Texas to kill law criminalizing illegal immigration,The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/biden-doj-sues-texas-to-kill-law-criminalizing-illegal-immigration,"The Biden Department of Justice made good Wednesday on its threat to sue Texas for attempting to protect American sovereignty amidst an unprecedented flood of illegal aliens over the southern border. The lawsuit comes one day after the Biden administration requested that the Supreme Court allow federal agents to remove some of the Lone Star State's more effective border defenses.

The complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, claims the efforts of the Republican-led state to do what the Biden administration appears unwilling or unable to do as it regards the border ""through [Senate Bill 4], intrude on the federal government's exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States' immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations.""

What's the background?

SB4 was ratified by Gov. Greg Abbott on Dec. 18 and goes into effect in March 5. It is one of a handful of new tools Republicans furnished Texas with last month to address record-high monthly illegal border crossings.

The over 300,000 illegal aliens who stole into the nation in December not only set an all-time monthly record, according to CBS News, but possibly pushed the number of reported illegal entries under President Joe Biden's watch past 7 million.

Should the DOJ's intervention fail, SB4 will make illegal entry into the Lone Star State a class B misdemeanor as well as allow for foreign nationals who refuse to leave the country to be charged with a second-degree felony, which carries prison time of up to 20 years.

Under the law, illegal aliens found in Texas ""at any time"" who have previously been convicted of two or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against a person, or both would be charged with a third-degree felony.

Leftist groups like the ACLU, long supportive of flouting federal immigration law, beat the Biden DOJ to the punch, alleging Texas would be usurping federal authority by enacting SB4.

The Mexican regime also condemned Texas over the legislation, stating on Nov. 15 that ""the Government of Mexico categorically rejects any measure that allows state or local authorities to detain and return Mexican or foreign nationals to Mexican territory.""

The Biden White House joined other leftist outfits and the foreign power in criticizing Texas. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called SB4 ""an extreme law that will not and does not make the communities in Texas safer.""

""And it is incredibly unfortunate. But this is what we see from particular Republicans trying to dehumanize a group of people who are coming here or some of them trying to migrate here,"" continued Jean-Pierre. ""And — and they're putting them in harm’s way. They're putting them in harm's way.""

The Biden DOJ threatened Abbott in a Dec. 28 letter that it was planning to ""bring a lawsuit to enforce the supremacy of federal law and to enjoining the operation of SB4."" It followed through on Wednesday.

DOJ's fight to ax law criminalizing illegal immigration

The lawsuit filed Wednesday ""on behalf of the United States, including the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of State,"" claims that ""Texas's SB 4 is preempted by federal law and thus violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. That conclusion is strongly reinforced by the Foreign Commerce Clause.""

While acknowledging that improper entry into the U.S. is already a crime, the DOJ cited the Supreme Court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States, stressing ""'the removal process' must be 'entrusted to the discretion of the Federal Government,' in part because a 'decision on removability . . . touch[es] on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.'""

In addition to warning that SB4 might ""undermine U.S. efforts to convince governments worldwide to implement or strengthen their international protection systems and uphold their respective non-refoulement obligations,"" the complaint suggested the law would ""also impede the federal government's ability to take appropriate enforcement actions and assess a noncitizen' national-security and public-safety risks.""

The DOJ requested that the court declare SB4 invalid and permanently enjoin Texas from enforcing the law.

""Texas cannot disregard the United States Constitution and settled Supreme Court precedent,"" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian Boynton said in a statement. ""We have brought this action to ensure that Texas adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.""

""Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution and longstanding Supreme Court precedent, states cannot adopt immigration laws that interfere with the framework enacted by Congress,"" said departing Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. ""The Justice Department will continue to fulfill its responsibility to uphold the Constitution and enforce federal law.""

Abbott responded Wednesday evening, writing, ""Biden sued me today because I signed a law making it illegal for an illegal immigrant to enter or attempt to enter Texas directly from a foreign nation. I like my chances.""

""Texas is the only government in America trying to stop illegal immigration,"" added the Republican governor.

Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze told CBS News in late December, ""Texas is prepared to take this fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to protect Texans and Americans from President Biden's open border policies.""

""President Biden's deliberate and dangerous inaction at our southern border has left Texas to fend for itself,"" continued Eze. ""Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 4 into law last week to help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas as the President refuses to enforce federal immigration law.""

Dec 19 2023,Texas Governor signs controversial immigration bill into law,KHON 2,center,https://khon2.com/washington-dc/texas-governor-signs-controversial-immigration-bill-into-law,"WASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) — On Tuesday, thousands of migrants wait to be processed by border patrol agents in Eagle Pass, Texas.

According to border officials, this month Eagle Pass saw an average of 2,000 illegal crossings per day. Officials say on Monday, that number doubled.

“The single highest day that we’ve ever had on record in terms of people being apprehended illegally at the southern border,” Sen. John Thune (R-SD) said. “Our country cannot be secure while we have 10,000 people a day pouring across our southern border.”

Thune said on Tuesday that the numbers alone stress the need for new border policy. But without a federal plan in place, Texas Governor Greg Abbott took matters into his own hands. On Monday, Abbott signed “Senate Bill 4” into law, giving local police the authority to arrest migrants who illegally cross the Texas-Mexico border between ports of entry.

“Now they are going to have the ability to arrest them and prosecute them and make them subject to jail,” Governor Abbott said.

Less than 24 hours after Abbott signed the bill into law, immigrant rights organizations filed a lawsuit challenging the new state law. In the lawsuit, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Texas Civil Rights Project argue the new law violates the U.S. Constitution because only the federal government has the constitutional authority to enforce immigration law.

Texas Democrats also vowed to fight the new law. On Monday, more than 20 Texas congressional democrats sent a letter to the Department of Justice, urging federal officials to immediately intervene and prevent the law from being implemented.

“This is an extreme law that will not and does not make the communities in Texas safer,” White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Tuesday’s White House briefing.

The Texas law is scheduled to take effect on March 5th."
Jan 04 2024,Justice Department's clash with Texas on new immigration law could head to Supreme Court,CBS Austin KEYE,center,https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/justice-departments-clash-with-texas-on-new-immigration-law-could-head-to-supreme-court,"Now that the Department of Justice has sued Texas over its controversial new immigration legislation, both sides have promised a fight that could rise all the way to the Supreme Court.

Texas justifies its new immigration powers through Senate Bill 4 by saying the federal government isn't doing enough to enforce the Southern Border. But the Department of Justice says it doesn't matter what Texas believes, it just doesn't have the authority to supersede the federal government.

""The question is, do they have the power to step in and take over enforcement of federal immigration laws?"" Constitutional lawyer Renea Hicks said.

Hicks says now that the Department of Justice has filed a suit, the next step will be to request a preliminary injunction - to pause the law from going into effect while the case is being heard.

""If granted, this would say there's going to be irreparable harm to the interests of the United States if this law goes into effect,"" Hicks said. ""This law seems likely to be unconstitutional.""

But because the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil rights groups are also suing Texas over the same bill, he says it's likely the courts might choose to have a joint hearing on the cases together.

""It would nearly certainly be both sets of plaintiffs, that is the United States and the private plaintiffs, having a hearing in front of the same judge with the same set of defendants coming in trying to argue that there should not be a preliminary injunction issued,"" Hicks said.



If the court chooses to issue an injunction while the case is being heard, Texas can ask the Fifth Circuit of Appeals to stay the decision instead. Then depending on how the Fifth Circuit rules, any party can make an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, which it may take quickly with the law set to take effect in March.

""Some of the justices don't like that term, but it's called the shadow docket where it's not like your typical case where briefs are argued and decided months later,"" Hicks said. ""They just do a quick turnaround of the week or two or three and issue a temporary ruling.""

However, Hicks says it's important to understand that this process is not either of the higher courts ruling on the substance of the legal challenge, which requires a final ruling from the district court first. That could take the Supreme Court much longer, perhaps one or two years, if it chooses to hear the case at all.

""The Fifth Circuit has to hear these things. That's its job,"" Hicks said. ""The Supreme Court's job is to decide who wants to hear these things.""

The time this legal fight could take says nothing about how much it could cost, with both the D.O.J. and the state of Texas funded by taxpayer dollars. And this is only the latest in several legal fights Texas has chosen to take on, though we'll have to wait some time to learn a final price tag."
Jan 03 2024,"GOP lawmakers head to border, step up attacks on Biden immigration record",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/01/02/us-border-mexico-migrants-closures/,"President Biden has started the new year facing intensifying political and financial pressure at the U.S.-Mexico border as his administration tries to land a funding deal with Republicans galvanized by another record influx of migrants last month. Sign up for Fact Checker, our weekly review of what's true, false or in-between in politics. ArrowRight U.S. agents recorded nearly 250,000 illegal crossings along the southern border in December, the highest one-month total ever, according to preliminary Customs and Border Protection data obtained by The Washington Post. That is twice the volume of arrivals CBP is budgeted to handle, according to agency officials.

Biden administration officials have responded by again asking the Mexican government to tighten enforcement, and they say the country’s latest efforts have helped reduce illegal crossings over the past week. But several of the broader policy changes Biden officials have considered to curb migration are tied up in negotiations with Republicans over nearly $14 billion in additional funding for border operations and the U.S. immigration court system — part of a larger $106 billion aid package requested for Ukraine and Israel.

“The administration now has a real incentive to make a deal,” said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan D.C. think tank. “There’s a lot of pressure to bring the numbers down in an election year and reduce the impact on cities around the country.”

GOP leaders believe they hold the upper hand on immigration heading into the November election, when their narrow House majority will be at stake. Polls show voters trust Republicans to handle immigration and border management better than Democrats, a view reinforced by images of chaos and disorder when crossings periodically spike.

Looking to capitalize on that momentum, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) traveled with a group of about 60 Republican lawmakers to the U.S.-Mexico border Wednesday to ramp up criticism of Biden’s immigration record and push for steeper policy concessions from the White House.

The delegation went to the border in Eagle Pass, Tex., where thousands of migrants waded across the Rio Grande last month, spending chilly nights in an outdoor holding area set up by overstretched Border Patrol agents.

Johnson told reporters it was “a disaster of the president’s own design,” blaming Biden’s moves to roll back President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.

“If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it better begin by defending America’s national security,” Johnson said.

Some Republicans went further in their calls demanding immediate action from the administration, suggesting that the House should shut down the government amid two looming deadlines if Democrats do not agree to their policy demands.

“None of us want to shut down the government, but we all recognize the fact that every single penny that we are giving to Homeland Security at this point that is not being used to secure the border … is hurting our national security, hurting our best interest, and killing our economy,” said Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Tex.).

Johnson skirted questions about whether House Republicans would shut down parts of the government as soon as mid-January, instead stressing that securing the border and reducing non-discretionary spending are top goals this year.

Many of the migrants who were released from U.S. custody with pending claims in U.S. immigration courts are starting to arrive in cities such as Denver, Chicago and New York, where shelters are already full and Democratic mayors are demanding more federal aid. Officials in Denver moved on Wednesday to clear a migrant tent camp where 400 people have been sleeping on the streets.

The crowded conditions bring heightened risk of respiratory infections and illness during the winter months. Officials in Chicago are investigating the death of a 5-year-old boy last month who was staying in one of the city’s packed shelters.

Thomas S. Warrick, a former DHS official who is now a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, said the cash injection is “absolutely vital” to keep the U.S. immigration system from breaking down further.

“A system that was already under enormous strain is now stretched to the point where even the most basic legal and humanitarian requirements can’t be met,” Warrick said.

The Trump administration received $4.6 billion in supplemental border funding in 2019 when border capacity and budgets were stretched by then-record numbers of migrant families, he said. “Just as the Trump administration got a supplemental [funding bill] passed in 2019, this administration needs to pass one in 2024,” Warrick said.

The policy changes sought by Republicans are designed to boost deportations and expand immigration detention, both of which will require a major injection of federal dollars, he said.

A bipartisan group of senators is engaged in negotiations that would unlock the supplemental funds by implementing enforcement measures sought by Republicans. The group had hoped to strike a deal and provide legislative text by next week in order for the Senate to move quickly on the bill before being overtaken by an all-consuming deadline to fund large parts of the federal government later in January.

The senators are negotiating over narrowing the pool of people eligible to apply for asylum as well as limiting the president’s power to offer humanitarian parole to categories of migrants, according to Senate aides briefed on the discussions.

Also under discussion: a mechanism to effectively shut the border during days with particularly high crossings, speeding up deportations for those who lose their immigration cases and other immigration policy changes.

Republican lawmakers in the House, including the speaker, have not been part of the negotiations, instead uniting around their demand for the Senate to pass their border security proposal, which was approved on a mostly party-line vote last spring.

Among other things, the House GOP bill would provide funding to restart the building of a border wall, curb the president’s ability to allow entry for migrants who do not qualify for visas and make sweeping changes to asylum eligibility — measures that Biden officials and many Democrats say they will not accept.

Days before the Christmas holiday, Johnson urged Biden to use his executive action authority to curb the record border crossings because the Senate had adjourned for the year without a deal.

The group that traveled to the border Wednesday visited the district of Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Tex.), an architect of the House GOP’s border security bill.

The group included House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Mark Green (R-Tenn.) who has launched impeachment proceedings against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, blaming him for the border influx.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre criticized House Republicans on Wednesday for focusing on impeachment proceedings against Mayorkas.

“They’re wasting their time on impeachment proceedings that make no sense,” she said. “It’s a political stunt. It’s baseless.”

“We need more resources,” Jean-Pierre said. “House Republicans keep getting in the way of doing the work to deal with what we’re seeing at the border,” she said.

Jean-Pierre downplayed the record number of migrants who crossed the border in December. “Every year we see an ebb and flow and that’s what we’re seeing at this time,” she said.

The 6 million-plus illegal crossings recorded since Biden took office represent the busiest span in the 100-year history of the U.S. Border Patrol, government records show.

Biden administration officials declined to say what specific measures Mexico has taken to reduce crossings over the past several days, referring reporters to Mexican authorities.

One Mexican official said the country’s national guard is doing more to support Mexico’s immigration enforcement agency — which has suffered major budget cuts — and Mexican officials have restarted direct deportation flights to Venezuela. About 500,000 Venezuelans have arrived in the United States via Mexico over the past three years.

The Mexican official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters, described the measures on the condition of anonymity.

Last week, Biden sent Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall to Mexico City to urge Mexican officials to do more to slow the volume of people arriving at the U.S. border.

About 2,500 migrants were taken into custody by U.S. agents on New Year’s Day, according to one of the Biden officials who spoke to reporters Tuesday, down from about 10,000 taken into custody per day in December. The official said crossings also dropped abruptly at holiday times during previous years, only to rebound in January.

Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that GOP lawmakers need to keep negotiating.

“It’s very nice that they have a trip to the border,” Schumer said. “But the only way to solve this is here, working in a bipartisan way with Senate Republicans, Senate Democrats and House Democrats to get it done, period.”

Jan 08 2024,Biden Sending Millions Overseas To Address ‘Root Causes’ Of Illegal Immigration. It’s Not Working.,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-sending-millions-overseas-to-address-root-causes-of-illegal-immigration-its-not-working,"The Biden administration has sent tens of millions of dollars to Latin American countries for programs that address “root causes” of illegal immigration, all as southern border crossings hit record highs.

The Biden administration has spent at least $40 million on immigration-related projects in Latin America in fiscal year 2023 that are ostensibly supposed to help bring down illegal immigration from the region, according to a Daily Wire review of foreign spending data.

The projects have been part of the Biden administration’s strategy to pump money into the region with the goal of decreasing illegal immigration. As Biden has sent money abroad, Republican lawmakers have urged more funding for security measures at the southern border. Critics also have pointed to Biden’s loose asylum policies and revocation of Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy as key reasons for the skyrocketing border crossings.

Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), a nonprofit that advocates for solutions to uncontrolled immigration, told The Daily Wire that the actual root cause of the illegal immigration crisis is the Biden administration’s immigration policy.

“The root cause of the surge of illegal immigration is the policies that the Biden administration put in place from day one, and continue to implement in spite of the fact that we’re seeing record numbers of people coming across the border. We seem to break a new record almost every month,” Mehlman said.

One initiative rolled out in fiscal year 2023 was the Alliance for Root Causes and Opportunities project, which is designed to address “the root causes that influence people from Central America to migrate to the United States through Mexico,” according to the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.

Mexico was allocated $5 million in 2023 for the project, which was implemented through Chemonics International, a private international development company. Another $3 million commitment to Mexico was designated for “basic education,” and $2 million was for agriculture in Mexico.

In 2023 alone, roughly 670,000 Mexicans crossed the southern border into the United States.

Another initiative, described by USAID as the “Irregular Migration Project,” sent millions of dollars to Guatemala, from where roughly 226,000 illegal immigrants into the United States have come. The purpose of the project is “addressing the root causes of irregular migration in Guatemala.”

Two grants, one for $8.5 million and the other for $2.5 million were allocated in fiscal year 2023 for Guatemala in the “good governance” sector. Another grant under the project was $2.2 million for “conflict mitigation and reconciliation,” while a fourth was $500,000 for “civil society.”

All the money is distributed with the help of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the United Nations’ immigration organization that says it is “dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration for the benefit of all.” The IOM feuded with former President Donald Trump by declining to seat his nominee to head the organization.

USAID also works with IOM on multiple projects under the “Scholarships For Educational Opportunities” banner.

“The project aims to mitigate irregular migration from El Salvador by increasing equitable access to formal educational opportunities for potential migrants and returnees to engender hope, prosperity, and positive self-worth in their lives,” the program’s description at USAID reads.

In fiscal year 2023, $4 million was designated for “basic education” in El Salvador while $2.9 million was allocated for “higher education.” There were also two grants for “private sector competitiveness,” both worth roughly $1.5 million.

Nearly 60,000 El Salvadorans illegally entered the United States in 2023.

Haiti, which has seen an epidemic of gang violence and civil disorder this year, was given two grants of $3.6 million and $2.7 million for “good governance” and “policies, regulations, and systems,” under the banner of “Humanitarian Assistance.”

The justification for the project was rooted in the fact that tens of thousands of Haitians have arrived at the U.S. border. In 2023 alone, roughly 69,095 Haitians entered the United States through the southern border.

“Since the end of August 2021, there are thousands of Haitians assembling in makeshift sites on the Mexican side of the border to wait while deciding whether to attempt entry into the U.S. carrying their belongings, the migrants have been traversing the ankle-deep river between Mexico and Texas. As of 17 September, there were about 13,700 new arrivals in Del Rio City,” the USAID project description says.

“The International Organization of Migration (IOM) aims to support the improvement of reception facilities to better welcome migrants upon their return to Haiti, both in Port-Au-Prince and Cap-Haitian. This will enable key stakeholders involved in migrant assistance to be prepared for repatriations and stand ready to welcome migrants even when informed in a very short notice,” USAID added.

The United States also sent millions to the region in general, under one project with the purpose of “Assistance for Informed, Safe and Dignified Returns of Vulnerable Migrants in Participating Countries of the Americas,” according to USAID. This project was worth $2.5 million and implemented alongside the IOM.

In total, the United States allocated $1,781,452,241 on all aid projects in fiscal year 2023 for Latin American countries where hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants came from. This included $441,300,796 to Colombia (137,389 illegal crossings), $9,519,970 to Cuba (63,135 illegal crossings), $50,751,799 to Ecuador (106,635 illegal crossings), $145,002,715 to El Salvador (59,693 illegal crossings), $187,388,066 to Guatemala (225,998 illegal crossings), $331,549,853 to Haiti (69,095 illegal crossings), $151,007,802 to Honduras (213,853 illegal crossings), $112,633,591 to Mexico (671,128 illegal crossings), $27,111,714 to Nicaragua (16,690 illegal crossings), $119,346,269 to Peru (55,276 illegal crossings), and $205,839,666 to Venezuela (302,736 illegal crossings).

Neither the White House or the State Department responded to request for comment.

The $1.7 billion total is just slightly under the $1.8 billion per year requested by Trump over a ten year period to construct a border wall. While Mehlman said that funding for a complete border wall, more detention centers, and additional Border Patrol officers would be helpful, the number one priority needed to be taking away incentives to enter the U.S. illegally.

“The number one priority actually does not entail money, it is creating deterrence. The people who are coming are coming for rational reasons. They understand that if they get to the border there is very, very high probability that they will be allowed to remain here indefinitely. We need to change that perception,” he said.

House Republicans visited the border this week calling for the Biden administration to clamp down on the crisis and secure the border.

“We were shown firsthand how the President’s reckless open-border policies are devastating communities across the state,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said of the visit. “The Biden Administration is showing once again it is obviously their deliberate strategy to keep the border open and continue the chaos and humanitarian crisis their policies have created.”

Dec 19 2023,Texas Passes Law Making Illegal Immigration a State Crime,American Greatness,right,https://amgreatness.com/2023/12/19/texas-passes-law-making-illegal-immigration-a-state-crime,"On Monday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott (R-Texas) signed a bill into law making it a state crime for illegal aliens to enter the state, and thus allowing state law enforcement to arrest them, the first such law of its kind in the nation.

Breitbart reports that the bill, SB 4, was signed into law in a massive public display at the southern border in Brownsville, Texas. In attendance was Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick (R-Texas), National Border Patrol Council President (NBPC) Brandon Judd, and numerous state lawmakers.

The bill, passed during Special Session #4 of the state legislature, makes it a criminal offense to illegally enter the state of Texas from a foreign country. As a result, those who illegally re-enter the state can now face sentences of up to 20 years in prison. State law enforcement will now be authorized to deport illegals back to the foreign nation from which they entered, and the law also provides civil immunity and indemnification for local and state officials, government employees, and government contractors from lawsuits targeting the new law.

Under the new law, illegals can cooperate with law enforcement by agreeing to return to their home country, a process known as Stipulated Deportation. The law also increases the penalties for immigration-related offenses that normally would be dealt with by the federal government, and builds off of several previously-passed laws that already increased criminal penalties for illegal immigration.

Such legislation is the latest effort by Governor Abbott to ramp up enforcement of border security by state authorities, as the federal government under Joe Biden has completely abandoned any efforts to secure the border. Federal immigration officials, such as ICE and Border Patrol, have been ordered to stand down and not arrest illegals, instead largely acting as escorts to help them enter the country.

Abbott had previously implemented measures such as installing a massive buoy barrier within the Rio Grande River to deter illegals from crossing the river into Texas. The Biden Administration tried to sue to have the barrier removed, but the effort ultimately failed in court. Later, when federal Border Patrol agents were ordered to cut through a barbed wire barrier also set up by Texas, the state sued over these actions and won in court. The Biden Administration is expected to challenge this new law in court as well."
Jan 04 2024,GOP puts immigration front and center with border visit and a new push to impeach Mayorkas,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republicans-put-immigration-border-security-enter-texas-2024-rcna132094,"WASHINGTON — Pushing to make border security a central issue in 2024, Speaker Mike Johnson and dozens of House Republicans headed to the southern border in Texas on Wednesday to draw attention to record migrant crossings and bash the Biden administration’s enforcement of immigration laws.

""Last month alone, we saw the most illegal crossings in recorded history. It is an unmitigated disaster, a catastrophe. And what's more tragic is that it's a disaster of the president's own design,"" Johnson, R-La., said at a news conference in Eagle Pass, Texas, where he was flanked by more than 60 GOP lawmakers.

The town has become a symbol of the need for immigration reform after images of hundreds of migrants amassing at the border circulated in the media.

""Under President Biden, America has laid out a welcome mat to illegal immigrants, smugglers and cartels,"" the speaker continued. ""He is responsible for the grave threat to our national security and our nation's sovereignty that these policies have created.""

The visit comes as House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green, R-Tenn., said Wednesday that his panel will officially begin its effort next week to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for failing to secure the border — though there's no guarantee Republicans will have enough votes to impeach him on the floor.

Green said the first impeachment hearing, titled “Havoc in the Heartland: How Secretary Mayorkas’ Failed Leadership Has Impacted the States,” will take place on Jan. 10, the same week lawmakers return from their holiday break.

""The greatest domestic threat to the national security and the safety of the American people is Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas,"" Green said in Eagle Pass. ""He, through his policies, has defied and subverted the laws passed by the United States Congress. He has defied multiple court orders. He has lied numerous times to the United States Congress. ... He has broken his oath to defend this country.""

The chairman’s decision to press forward with impeachment follows the panel's nearly yearlong investigation into Mayorkas and the border, culminating in a fifth and final interim report released on Dec. 21.

GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Donald Trump’s most loyal allies on Capitol Hill, had unsuccessfully pushed to impeach Mayorkas multiple times. On Nov. 13, the House voted to refer her latest impeachment resolution against Mayorkas to the Homeland Security panel.

Mia Ehrenberg, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, slammed the GOP's impeachment push as a ""baseless political exercise"" and ""a harmful distraction from our critical national security priorities.""

Addressing the developments Wednesday on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Mayorkas pointed to his meetings on Capitol Hill with a bipartisan group of senators trying to secure a deal to fix the immigration system. And Mayorkas said he and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador last week to discuss ways to address rampant migration due to things like climate change and political instability — what he called a “regional problem that is challenging our entire hemisphere.”

Mayorkas also called on Congress to pass Biden’s $106 billion supplemental package that includes aid for Ukraine and Israel, as well as border security funding. House Republicans, however, insist they won’t approve any foreign aid without tough border and immigration policies, with Johnson saying Wednesday that any Biden national security supplemental measure ""better begin by defending America’s national security"" on the border.

“More border patrol agents, more asylum officers, more immigration judges, more investment in technology to battle the scourge of fentanyl,” Mayorkas said on MSNBC. “We are focused on fixing the challenge, on fixing the problem. We are focused on solutions.”

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates knocked Johnson for traveling to the border rather than staying in Washington and helping to support the Senate border talks. Bates also took aim at Republicans for pushing for budget cuts last year that would have impacted border security.

“Actions speak louder than words,” Bates said in a statement. “House Republicans’ anti-border security record is defined by attempting to cut Customs and Border Protection personnel, opposing President Biden’s record-breaking border security funding, and refusing to take up the President’s supplemental funding request.”

The back-and-forth over the border comes as U.S. Customs and Border Protection is experiencing record migrant border crossings. CBP encountered roughly 300,000 migrants at the southwest border in December, a record high, according to two Department of Homeland Security officials. Last month, CBP also saw the highest daily crossings on record at the southwest border, at times eclipsing 12,000 per day.

However, officials said the number of crossings often fluctuates. And on Monday, CBP said it encountered fewer than 500 migrants in the Del Rio sector of Texas, which includes Eagle Pass. Those lower figures came as the Biden administration announced it was reopening four ports of entry at the southern border, including at Eagle Pass, that had been closed due to the record influx of migrants.

On Wednesday at Eagle Pass, some Republican lawmakers, including Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Andy Biggs of Arizona, began issuing a new warning: If Biden doesn't shut down the border, Republicans will shut down the government this month.

""None of us want to shut down the government,"" Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, a former mayor and former Trump administration official, said at Eagle Pass. ""But we all recognize the fact that every single penny that we are giving to Homeland Security at this point that is not being used to secure our border, that is not being used to increase our national security ... is hurting our national security, hurting our best interests and killing our economy and local governments.""

With Election Day now 10 months away and control of the White House, the Senate and the House all at stake, Johnson made it clear he views the border as a major political liability for Biden and the Democrats.

""The longer we wait, the longer we delay the closure and security of this border, the greater the crisis and the problem,"" Johnson told reporters at the border.

""In large measure because of this issue, I do think that we're going to have a change in the White House,"" he said. ""I think we're going to have a Republican president. I think we're going to win the Senate, and we're going to expand the majority in the House."""
Dec 29 2023,DOJ warns Abbott of possible lawsuit over Texas’ new immigration law,MSNBC,left,https://msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/greg-abbott-lawsuit-texas-immigration-law-doj-rcna131604,"The Justice Department is threatening Texas Gov. Greg Abbott with a potential lawsuit over his state’s newly minted anti-immigration law that makes it a state crime to cross into Texas from Mexico without federal authorization.

In a letter to Abbott, the Biden administration warns that Senate Bill 4, which grants local officials broad latitude to apprehend and deport people believed to have entered Texas illegally, usurps immigration enforcement authority from federal officials.

The law, which is set to take effect March 5, “is preempted and violates the United States Constitution” and “purports to create new state crimes tied to federal prohibitions on unlawful entry and reentry by noncitizens into the United States,” the letter says.

The letter also says the law creates a “separate state immigration scheme” and conflicts with federal protections for migrants who seek U.S. protection from persecution or torture.

CBS News reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez posted a copy of the letter on social media.

And so begins a legal and political quagmire for the Lone Star State.

Abbott signed S.B. 4 last week as part of Operation Lone Star, his beleaguered immigration crackdown. Texas Republicans also have pushed to allow authorities to get more physical in their handling of migrants, while employing disgusting “invasion” rhetoric. S.B. 4 closely resembles controversial legislation in Arizona known as the “show me your papers” law, which was ruled largely unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2012.

As I wrote earlier this week, the fallout over that law should have given Texas Republicans nightmares — or, at least, some pause — before approving this bill. That’s because the Arizona law precipitated civil rights abuses that snowballed into costly lawsuits against the state, as well as massive local protests and economic boycotts. And it sparked a progressive movement that Arizona Republicans still haven’t quelled.

We may see a similar situation unfold in Texas. Several activist groups already have sued to thwart S.B. 4. And if the past is prologue, that lawsuit — along with the potential suit from the Justice Department — could merely be the tip of the iceberg, as far as acts of resistance are concerned."

Dec 19 2023,Texas’ new immigration law will lead to more policing with less accountability,Reason,right,https://reason.com/2023/12/19/texas-new-immigration-law-will-lead-to-more-policing-with-less-accountability,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a sweeping immigration enforcement bill into law yesterday, making illegal immigration a state crime and allowing local judges to issue deportation orders. Once Senate Bill 4 takes effect, Texas law enforcement will be authorized to stop, arrest, and jail migrants—a power that could lead to racial profiling and a costly expansion of policing.

S.B. 4 makes it a state crime, ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony, for an undocumented person to enter Texas outside an official port of entry. Law enforcement will be permitted to arrest people they think entered the state illegally, and not just in the border region. S.B. 4 will let Texas law enforcement ""arrest undocumented immigrants anywhere in the state,"" reported The Texas Tribune. The law is set to take effect on March 5, 2024.

There will no doubt be cut-and-dry arrests, such as cases where an officer sees someone physically crossing the border in an unauthorized area and discovers that the person is undocumented. But S.B. 4 allows enforcement in a much more ambiguous zone: How can officers, by sight alone, identify a person who entered the state illegally but now lives in Dallas? The potential for racial profiling is clear.

""It'd be very difficult to say that this is racial profiling—it's not,"" countered state Rep. David Spiller (R–Jacksboro), who sponsored the bill in the Texas House, in a November 29 episode of the Y'all-itics podcast, as USA Today reported this week. ""It's whether someone has met the elements of this offense.""

Spiller argued that ""95 percent of [enforcement] would be within 50 miles of the border,"" but ""there could be circumstances where law enforcement officers would know"" that someone encountered far from the border would qualify for prosecution. ""We don't want to necessarily limit it, we don't want to tie law enforcement's hands, and so that's why it's a statewide law,"" he continued.

But that's exactly what would allow law enforcement to stop and detain Texas residents based on potentially flimsy evidence, leaving the door open for harmful interactions with police well beyond the border. And some language in the law could make it even more difficult for Texans whose rights have been violated to seek redress.

Specifically written into the text of S.B. 4 is language that will help shield officials from liability. ""The law provides civil immunity and indemnification for local and state government officials, employees, and contractors for lawsuits resulting from the enforcement of these provisions,"" noted a press release from Abbott's office.

Texas has a track record of controversial immigration enforcement tactics under Abbott. Among them is Operation Lone Star, a border-securing mission that imposed a trespassing charge on migrants crossing into the state on private property. But many immigrants had those charges ""dismissed or rejected,"" found a 2022 ProPublica report. ""Prosecutors and judges deemed certain arrests questionable after some immigrants said [Department of Public Safety] troopers marched them through private property."" As of July, Operation Lone Star has cost Texas taxpayers over $4.5 billion, to questionable effect.

S.B. 4 is perhaps the most drastic immigration enforcement law since Arizona's S.B. 1070, passed in 2010. It required police to investigate people's immigration status and made it a state crime to be in the country illegally, among other things. Courts eventually struck down key parts of S.B. 1070, with the Supreme Court ruling in 2012 that certain measures were preempted by federal law.

S.B. 4 is already facing legal challenges of its own. El Paso County and two immigrant rights groups sued Texas over the law today, as did the American Civil Liberties Union. A group of congressional Democrats has urged the Justice Department to intervene.

The Biden administration's approach to the border is deeply flawed. There are many policies it—or Congress—could adopt to help make migration flows more predictable and manageable while respecting the rights of newcomers and settled immigrants. S.B. 4 doesn't do any of that. Instead, it'll put Texans at risk of rights violations and strain relationships between local communities and law enforcement, relying on the same hardline tactics that have been proven ineffective again and again."
Dec 22 2023,US immigration backlog reaches new record of 3 million pending cases: report,Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-immigration-backlog-reaches-record-3-million-pending-cases-report,"The Immigration Court backlog in the U.S. surpassed three million pending cases last month amid a continued crisis at the Southern Border.

The three million pending cases reported in November include one million that were added within the previous 12 months, according to a report from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Immigration judges currently average 4,500 pending cases each, TRAC reported.

""Previous administrations — all the way back through at least the George W. Bush administration — have failed when they tried to tackle the seemingly intractable problem of the Immigration Court 'backlog.' Recently, however, the accelerating growth in the Court's backlog has transformed the problem into an even more daunting challenge,"" TRAC's report noted.

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SIGNS BILL MAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION A STATE CRIME

During the last quarter, from July to September, the backlog rose by nearly 400,000 cases at an average increase of 130,000 cases per month, according to the report. The monthly growth was even higher in October and November at an average of 140,000 cases per month.

In comparison, the backlog in September 2016 was sitting at 516,031 cases, roughly one-sixth of the current total, according to an analysis by TRAC. The 278 immigration judges at the time, during the final fiscal year of the Obama administration, completed an average of around 750 cases each year while the average caseload assigned was 1,850 per judge.

The backlog accelerated during the Trump years, the report highlighted. The backlog grew two and a half times more by September 2020, during the final fiscal year of the Trump administration, compared to September 2016. During this time, the number of judges also grew to 484, and average pending caseloads were around 2,600 per judge.

The number of new judges hired accelerated during the first three years of the Biden administration, with a total of 682 immigration judges now sitting on the bench. Each judge also closed an average of around 975 cases during the latest fiscal year, a closure rate nearly a third greater than seven years ago during the final year of the Obama administration.

Despite having more judges and higher case closures per judge, the judges still have not been able to keep pace with the number of incoming cases. Because of this, the average caseloads of the 682 judges on the bench have risen to 4,500 per judge.

Fox News' Griff Jenkins reported that Eagle Pass, Texas, was overwhelmed with migrants Monday night when more than 4,000 illegally crossed the Southern Border, on top of the more than 4,000 already in custody.

Video footage obtained by Fox News' Bill Melugin showed thousands of migrants in Eagle Pass waiting to be processed by Border Patrol after they crossed illegally on Monday.

Dec 22 2023,Immigration court backlog tops 3M with some getting dates 5 years out,NewsNation,center,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/border-coverage/immigration-backlog-3-million/,"(NewsNation) — As the U.S. continues to deal with record numbers of migrants and asylum-seekers crossing the southern border, the border crisis is made worse by a backlogged and slow immigration court system.

Immigration courts are tasked with processing asylum claims and removal proceedings for those who entered the country without going through legal channels. The right to ask for asylum applies regardless of whether someone enters the U.S. through a port of entry or crosses illegally, but all asylum cases still have to go through the court system.

Once immigrants are processed, they’re given a court date to appear for the next step in their case. But because of the recent influx of migrants and a lack of resources, many of those follow-up dates have been up to five years out.

NewsNation obtained two order-to-appear notices from two migrants, both issued just five days ago. One had an appearance date in September of 2027 and the other was for July 2029.

Data from TracImmigration shows the backlog of cases has now topped 3 million, with each judge in the system being assigned roughly 4,500 cases. It’s a big jump from last year’s backlog of 2 million.

The immigration court system has been dealing with backlogs for years, but the increase in cases began rising dramatically around 2020. In December of 2016, there was a backlog of 533,909. By December 2019, that number jumped to 1,089,696 and by December 2022, the backlog stood at 2,056,328.

The problem is resources. In addition to a lack of border patrol agents, there aren’t enough judges to handle the cases.

At the end of Title 42 in May, Department of Homeland Security Director Alejandro Mayorkas said the Biden administration was increasing personnel to address the then-expected surge in migrants crossing the border after the COVID-era immigration policy lifted.

“We have surged 24,000 Border Patrol Agents and Officers, and thousands of troops, contractors, and over a thousand asylum officers and judges to see this through. We are clear-eyed about the challenges we are likely to face in the days and weeks ahead, and we are ready to meet them,” Mayorkas said at the time.

Title 42 allowed border agents to turn people away at the border without going through official removal proceedings. But because people were not removed, they also faced no penalties for attempting to cross again at another time as they do under the current Title 8 policy.

The Biden administration has requested funding for hiring additional judges in a supplemental funding request currently being discussed in Congress, including funding for Ukraine and Israel and money for border security.

But the number in the request falls short of the number of judges that would be needed to work through the backlog of cases.

Meanwhile, more immigrants continue to cross the border.

Customs and Border Patrol sources confirm that more than 12,200 people crossed into the U.S. through the southern border on Tuesday, nearly 3,000 of those in the Tucson sector. In the Del Rio sector, where NewsNation has been reporting from Eagle Pass, more than 4,400 crossed on the same day.

As long as the surge continues, court cases will continue to pile up."
Dec 21 2023,Texas governor signs SB4 bill making immigration laws stricter,WNDU 16,center,https://wndu.com/2023/12/22/texas-governor-signs-sb4-bill-making-immigration-laws-stricter,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. (WNDU) - Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas stirred heated debates and raised concerns on Monday by signing SB4.

It is one of the most stringent immigration laws in modern U.S. history. This legislation grants Texas officials the authority to apprehend, detain, and pursue deportation procedures against migrants suspected of unlawfully crossing the border from Mexico.

The law, slated to be enforced in March of 2024, also allows state judges to order immigrants to leave the country.

Governor Abbott’s support for this legislation underscores his persistent opposition to President Biden’s border policies.

Critics of the SB4, cite concerns over its constitutionality and its potential to promote racial profiling.

The move had been expected since Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) signed the laws last month, one of which made illegally crossing the border a state crime that is subject to imprisonment or deportation. Immigration law is historically the jurisdiction of the federal government, a fact touted by the DOJ in the lawsuit.

“The United States brings this action to preserve its exclusive authority under federal law to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens,” the lawsuit read. “Texas’s Senate Bill 4 (SB 4) creates purported state immigration crimes for unlawful entry and unlawful reentry, permits state judges and magistrates to order the removal of noncitizens from the country, and mandates that state officials carry out those removal orders.”

“But Texas cannot run its own immigration system,” the filing continued. “Its efforts, through SB 4, intrude on the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate the entry and removal of noncitizens, frustrate the United States’ immigration operations and proceedings, and interfere with U.S. foreign relations. SB 4 is invalid and must be enjoined.”

The law is slated to take effect in March and will allow Texas police to arrest people suspected of immigrating illegally. If found to be in the United States illegally, detainees will be given the choice of leaving the country or accepting a judge’s ruling on misdemeanor charges. Subsequent arrests carry the risk of more serious felony penalties.

“Today in Brownsville, I signed three new laws to better protect Texans AND Americans from Biden’s open border policies,” Abbott said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. “Illegal entry into Texas is now a crime subject to removal or imprisonment. Texas will also fund new wall construction & increase human smuggling penalties.”"
Dec 21 2023,Migrant Flight from Texas to Chicago: Impact on US Border & Immigration,Alaska Commons,center,https://alaskacommons.com/migrant-flight-from-texas-to-chicago-impact-on-us-border-immigration-video/95899,"The arrival of a plane carrying immigrants in the city has raised concerns about the living conditions of the families on board. One family, with whom a reporter spoke, revealed that they only had some sheets to sleep on the floor with their children. The plane, which had departed from Texas, landed at 7:15 at night at the Chicago airport. The family expressed their confusion and uncertainty about what to do next.

According to a press release from the mayor’s office, the immigrants who were on the plane fled from the terminal in an Uber before the police arrived. Among them was a woman who had recently given birth in Venezuela and her eight-year-old son who was suffering from a serious illness. The woman shared that she had been experiencing severe headaches, and her son had multiple tumors in his head.

The governor of Texas issued a statement, attributing the expansion of the operation to include flights to Chicago to the Mayor Mike Johnson’s failure to address the sanctuary city issue. This move has been criticized by Councilman Azquez, who believes it is a political tactic by the Biden administration.

In response to the situation, Chicago issued an ordinance that those who abandon undocumented migrants will face charges. This prompted a call for federal government intervention to stop such acts. The governor of Texas, however, has defended the decision, stating that they will continue to send people, whether by plane or other means.

The ongoing debate and actions taken by both Texas and Chicago have sparked concerns about the treatment and living conditions of immigrants arriving in the city. The situation has also raised questions about the responsibilities of local and federal authorities in addressing the needs of undocumented migrants. As the issue continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how the federal government will respond to the calls for intervention and the impact it will have on the lives of immigrants in the city.

Dec 19 2023,Texas Gov. Abbott signs bill to let police make immigration arrests,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/19/texas-greg-abbott-migrant-bill-sb4/,"SAN ANTONIO — Civil rights groups sued Texas on Tuesday over a controversial new law that would allow state and local police to arrest and deport migrants suspected of being in the country illegally, a power that until now has rested solely with the federal government. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The legal challenge came a day after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed the bill into law and as negotiations over new border security measures appeared stalled in the U.S. Senate at least until after the holidays.

The influx of migrants into the United States has become a potent political issue in the 2024 presidential race and in several U.S. cities, including Chicago, where authorities this week are investigating the death of a 5-year-old migrant child who fell ill at a large shelter.

“It’s a mess,” Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said of the many priorities Congress must deal with in January, including a deal to strengthen U.S. border policy in exchange for sending more aid to Ukraine. The chamber will face a lot of deadlines at the beginning of the year, he noted, “and we don’t have a great record when it comes to that.”

The lawsuit filed against Texas sets up a potential showdown between the state and the federal government over who has ultimate authority to protect borders and enforce immigration law. It is a fight that Abbott has longed for. The law also gives Texas courts the power to order immigrants suspected of entering the state illegally to return to the country through which they entered.

“These laws will help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas,” Abbott said in a statement Monday.

The Supreme Court in 2012 struck down elements of an Arizona law that gave state officials similar powers to enforce immigration policies, ruling that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility. But a legal challenge to Texas’s legislation will come before a more right-leaning high court, with a 6-3 conservative supermajority.

“Immigration is a quintessentially federal authority,” said the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by a group of Texas civil and immigrant rights organizations, El Paso County, and the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that the law, known as S.B. 4, violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution. “A state cannot replace Congress’ immigrant scheme with its own.”

The Texas law is the latest in a drumbeat of increasingly aggressive tactics by Abbott to address the historic numbers of people seeking asylum and crossing the state’s border. His administration has bused tens of thousands of migrants to cities in other states; deployed hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers to place spiked buoys in the Rio Grande and string razor wire along the Texas riverbank; and empowered state troopers to arrest migrants on private property and charge them with state crimes.

In response to the lawsuit, the governor said in a statement that “President Biden has repeatedly refused to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books and do his job to secure the border. In his absence, Texas has the constitutional authority to secure our border through historic laws like S.B. 4. Texas will take this fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.”

Separately Tuesday, the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit temporarily blocked the Biden administration from destroying razor-wire border fencing installed by Texas officials, pending the outcome of the state’s appeal of a lower-court judge’s ruling in favor of the federal government.

Abbott also signed legislation this week that authorizes $1.54 billion more in state border wall construction funding and sets a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for human smuggling.

There were more than 2 million illegal crossings at the southwest border with Mexico for each of the past two fiscal years ending Sept. 30, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Border crossings have surged since dropping sharply in June, with migrants from around the globe entering from Mexico to seek asylum, economic opportunities or a new life in the United States.

Entering the United States, other than through an approved crossing, is already illegal under federal law and is policed by federal authorities.

But thousands of migrants have been arriving to seek humanitarian protection or work, and they generally are not prosecuted, especially families. When more people cross the border illegally than federal agencies can process, migrants are often released into the United States to await a far-in-the-future court date.

Congress has failed for decades to pass major immigration legislation that could address the border situation. Details of the current negotiations have not been made public. But several senators and aides briefed on the talks say they involve legislation that would make it easier to expel or quickly deport some migrants and raise the standard for migrants to be able to apply for asylum, all in exchange for Ukraine aid. The proposals would pose political challenges for both Democrats and Republicans and would almost certainly draw challenges from migrant advocacy and civil rights groups.

The surge in border crossings has reverberated across the country, with Democratic cities such as New York, Washington and Chicago struggling — along with border communities — to address the needs of tens of thousands of new arrivals, many of them bused from the Texas border.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson (D) lashed out at Abbott this week after a 5-year-old migrant boy staying in a shelter in the city fell ill and died. The mayor said the governor was sending new arrivals north without regard for their health or physical needs.

Abbott spokesman Andrew Mahaleris accused Johnson of lying and said migrants who are bused north volunteer for the rides. The buses are stocked with food and water, he said, and make stops where migrants can buy additional supplies.

Local law enforcement officials across Texas said they are analyzing the potential impact of the new law that gives them the power to make immigration arrests. Leaders of smaller agencies have said allocating resources to enforce immigration law could divert attention from protecting their communities. The governor’s border crackdown, Operation Lone Star, has already overwhelmed small county jails and prosecutors with dockets full of cases of migrant men and, recently, women arrested on trespassing charges.

“I don’t have space in my jail,” said Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber, a former Border Patrol agent whose jurisdiction is home to Eagle Pass, where 1,000 to 5,000 migrants a day regularly attempt to cross into the country.

Under the new law, 79 different law enforcement agencies — from constables to school resource officers — in the Houston area alone would have the power to arrest undocumented immigrants, said Cesar Espinosa, executive director of Fiel, a civil rights organization. Some larger city and county police departments have said they are concerned that enforcing S.B. 4 will make them vulnerable to accusations of racial profiling and instill fear in immigrant communities with whom they’ve spent years building trust.

Espinosa’s group has begun holding town hall meetings about the measure with its 16,000 members, many of whom are immigrants and undocumented; such people make up a significant portion of the Texas labor force and contribute to the state’s economic success, he said.

“This is Texas’s Prop 187 moment as it was in California. It’s worse than S.B. 1070 in Arizona,” said state Rep. Armando Walle (D), referring to two similar laws that galvanized voters in those states against Republicans. The Arizona law was later blocked by the Supreme Court.

Walle said the new law also reflects the continued anti-immigrant rhetoric embraced by former president Donald Trump, now the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Over the weekend, Trump — whom Abbott endorsed last month — accused undocumented immigrants of waging an “invasion” of the United States and “poisoning the blood” of the country.

Migrants who cross the border illegally have cost Texas more than $12 billion, said state Sen. Charles Perry (R-Lubbock), who sponsored S.B. 4. He said the Biden administration has ignored those costs, and he called for the courts to “weigh in on the responsibility of sovereignty over our borders.”

“A country that doesn’t have a border ceases to be a country,” Perry said.

Texas cleared out two state prisons in the last several years to house migrants detained under Abbott’s Operation Lone Star initiative; some of them languished in cells beyond statutory limits and were ordered released by state judges. Perry said that under S.B. 4, the state will find space and money to lock up even more undocumented immigrants so the world gets the message that Texas is no longer open to them.

But attorneys and advocates critical of Abbott’s border crackdown say migrants are rarely familiar enough with the details of state law for it to deter those already on their way to northern Mexico.

El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego called the new law “one of the most horrible mandates we’ve ever faced” and said the county does not have the resources to enforce it.

Mexican officials have also rejected Texas’s plan to send expelled migrants back into their territory under the new law.

The legislation was pushed by hard-liners such as Texans for Strong Borders, which listed a crackdown on illegal immigrants among its 2023 legislative priorities. The group’s president, Chris Russo — who drew criticism this fall for meeting with white-supremacist leader Nick Fuentes — has been critical of Abbott in the past, saying the governor had not gone far enough to secure the border.

The governor, who was once considered a possible 2024 presidential hopeful, has been sensitive to such criticism after facing upstart primary challenges from candidates in the most conservative wing of the state party.

“Unfortunately, Operation Lone Star has not been effective in stopping illegal entry, as evidenced by the record numbers of illegal crossings,” Russo said. “In order for S.B. 4 to be effective, it must be coupled with a concerted effort by the state to actually repel illegal border crossings.”"

Dec 29 2023,Biden Admin Threatens to Sue if Texas Doesn’t Agree to ‘Refrain from Enforcing’ Immigration Law,Western Journal,not-yet-rated,https://westernjournal.com/biden-admin-threatens-sue-texas-unless-lone-star-state-agrees-refrain-enforcing-law,"We call them “states’ rights,” but that makes no sense.

States do not have rights. Only people have rights. And the sovereign people of the states have the right to defend themselves when their criminally negligent federal government refuses to do so.

On Thursday, we learned that the Department of Justice disagrees.

In a letter to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton objected to a new Texas law designed to combat illegal immigration and threatened to sue the state “unless Texas agrees to refrain from enforcing the law.”

Senate Bill 4, set to take effect on March 5, will make illegal entry from Mexico into Texas a state crime. By definition, illegal entry into the U.S. already constitutes a federal crime.

Under the new law, Texas police will have the authority to arrest illegal immigrants.

Boynton challenged SB 4 on the grounds that it interferes in an exclusive domain of the federal government, namely immigration enforcement.

JUST IN — The Biden administration has warned Texas that it will sue the state if it enforces SB4, a law signed by Gov. Abbott that would allow state officials to arrest, jail and prosecute migrants on illegal entry criminal charges, according to a letter obtained by CBS News. pic.twitter.com/OolQGjn63t — Camilo Montoya-Galvez (@camiloreports) December 28, 2023

Connoisseurs of chutzpah will delight in the penultimate sentence of Boynton’s opening paragraph.

“The United States is committed to both securing the border and ensuring the processing of noncitizens consistent with the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),” he wrote.

That supposed commitment to a secure border has resulted in record migrant crossings indistinguishable from an invasion.

Abbott responded to the letter on X.

“The Biden Admin. not only refuses to enforce current U.S. immigration laws, they now want to stop Texas from enforcing laws against illegal immigration,” the governor posted.

“I’ve never seen such hostility to the rule of law in America. Biden is destroying America. Texas is trying to save it.”

The Biden administration has had three years to show its “commitment” to border security. But it has not done so.

Thus, one must conclude that the administration has no intention of enforcing federal immigration laws. In that event, the sovereign people have no choice but to act through their state legislatures.

SB 4 reflects all of these realities, and Abbott acknowledged them in his post.

The governor did not say, however, that the threat of legal action would have no effect. And at some point, he needs to say this.

Abbott must tell the DOJ that only federal enforcement of federal immigration laws will prevent SB 4 from taking effect.

Furthermore, if the federal government persists in its criminal negligence, then Abbott must act to secure Texas’ border. And he must do so regardless of what any federal court might rule.

The framers of the U.S. Constitution did not grant the federal government the kind of power it daily wields. And they did not give courts the authority to overrule the other two branches of government.

Federalism does not work that way. Neither does the separation of powers.

In short, if the DOJ sues, Texans should welcome the showdown. Then, whatever happens, they should proceed as they see fit with the enforcement of SB 4.

Dec 18 2023,Texas Guv Signs Wild New Bill Making Immigration a State Crime,Daily Beast,left,https://thedailybeast.com/texas-gov-greg-abbott-signs-bill-allowing-state-arrests-for-illegal-border-crossings-into-law,"Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) on Monday signed into law a controversial bill putting immigration enforcement into the hands of state officers, allowing them to arrest anyone suspected of crossing the United States’ southern border illegally and expel them out of the country.

The measure, known as SB4, is set to take effect in March. It empowers Texas police to stop and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally, and Texas judges to issue them de facto deportation orders. Suspected illegal migrants who refuse to return to Mexico could face charges ranging from class A misdemeanors to second-degree felonies.

“Biden’s deliberate inaction has left Texas to fend for itself,” Abbott said at a signing ceremony at the border wall, according to The New York Times.

The move is expected to be met with swift legal challenges, including from the federal government, which was long the sole arbiter of immigration and border laws. (It is already a crime to cross the border illegally under federal law. The last state legislation to attempt to wrest those powers away, a 2010 measure in Arizona known as the “show me your papers” law, was largely struck down by the Supreme Court.)

In November, 30 former U.S. immigration judges signed a statement agreeing that the proposed legislation was “not lawful” and prophesying it would cause “massive family separation.”

“Immigration is plainly a federal function,” the group wrote. “State legislators cannot enact immigration laws for the same reasons that the United States Congress cannot enact Texas state legislation.”

The bill, forced through the Texas State Legislature last month over the objections of Democratic lawmakers, has also been met with blowback from civil liberties groups, which have argued it will encourage racial profiling. The ACLU has promised to drag Texas to court over the issue.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and chief executive of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in response to the bill’s signing that it “knowingly dances on the edge of constitutional cliffs at the expense of vulnerable children and families” and makes “ethnicity a shortcut to suspicion.”

“By criminalizing the very act of seeking refuge,” she continued, “Texas is turning its back on the values of compassion and due process that make our nation the world’s beacon of humanitarian leadership.”

The Mexican government similarly denounced the legislation in a statement last month, saying it “categorically” rejected the measure. Local officials, including sheriffs and county executives, have also expressed concerns that its passage could endanger communities and threaten already overcrowded jails.

The law’s backers, on the other hand, have insisted on its constitutionality and praised its strength. “It’s a landmark bill that allows Texas to protect Texans,” state Rep. David Spiller, the Republican sponsor behind the bill, said during a House debate last month, according to NPR.

Abbott on Monday also signed into law a measure that allows $1.5 billion more in funding for the state to bolster its 1,200-mile border. His government has tested a number of strategies to deal with what he on Monday called the recent “tidal wave” of illegal immigration into the country. Under the banner of its Operation Lone Star, this has included the installation of a floating barrier, the deployment of National Guard troops to the border, and busing migrants to blue states in the north."
Jan 04 2024,Dozens of House Republicans Visit the U.S.-Mexico Border as Congressional Debate Over Immigration Reform Continues,The Maine Wire,right,https://themainewire.com/2024/01/dozens-of-house-republicans-visit-the-u-s-mexico-border-as-congressional-debate-over-immigration-reform-continues,"On Wednesday, Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) and dozens of other House Republicans traveled to Eagle Pass, Texas, a city that has garnered national attention in recent weeks due to it being on the front line of a recent surge in illegal border crossings.

House Republicans have turned much of their focus in Congress toward border security recently, as a record number of migrants poured across the border in December.



With more and more Republicans becoming skeptical of the war in Ukraine as it drags on, President Biden has attempted to bundle border spending together with a large foreign aid package. However, many Congressional Republicans have demanded changes to existing immigration laws in addition to just an increase in funding.

In May of 2023, House Republicans passed H.R.2, a bill titled Secure the Border Act of 2023. This bill includes a demand for the resumption of border wall construction, new more stringent demands on asylum eligibility, and higher penalties for visa overstays.

H.R.2 passed without any votes from Democrats, highlighting the partisan divide on immigration reforms.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York) has criticized proposed Republican immigration reforms. “The Republican approach is anchored in xenophobia and fanning the flames of hatred and distrust and of irresponsible policies that will do nothing to solve the problem.”, said Jeffries.

On their visit to Eagle Pass, House Republicans toured a Customs and Border Protection processing facility and saw sites that were recently flooded with migrants. In December, the railroad crossing into Eagle Pass was shut down by Customs and Border Protection temporarily due to smuggling operations using trains to move migrants illegally into America.

In a press conference held in the afternoon, Republican House leaders reiterated that border security is their highest legislative priority.

Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson considered the trip to Eagle Pass to be an “eye-opener”, after having met with local residents and officials, sheriffs, and the Texas Department of Safety.

Speaking to the urgency of the problem at a national scale, Rep. Johnson proclaimed, “Every state in America is now a border state.”

Johnson also called the border crisis an “unmitigated disaster” and pointed out that December had the most recorded illegal border crossings ever.

Republicans have heaped blame for the current illegal immigration problem onto President Biden, stating that it is due to his policies.

“What is more tragic, is it is a disaster of the President’s own design.”, said Rep. Johnson.

Rep. Johnson blamed the Biden administration for rolling back border security measures put in place under the Trump administration. He remarked that on Biden’s first day in office, he stopped the construction of the southern border wall and ended the remain-in-Mexico policy.

Johnson placed his confidence in the Trump-era policies, proclaiming that reinstating the remain-in-Mexico policy alone could curb the rate of attempted migrant crossings by 70% or more.

Johnson also put his support behind Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s efforts to prevent illegal immigration.

“Right here in Texas Governor Abbott has heroically done more to enforce the law than the President.”, said Johnson.

Gov. Abbott recently signed several bills into Texas state law that gave state authorities greater power to enforce border security and created penalties in Texas state law for illegal immigration.

Rep. Johnson pointed out that the federal government has sued Texas in response to these new state laws. This lawsuit, in Johnson’s eyes, was the Biden administration undermining any authorities who are trying to address the border crisis.

The House Republicans present also expressed their displeasure with Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas.

Not mincing words, Homeland Security Committee Chair Rep. Mark Green (R-Tennessee) called Mayorkas “The greatest domestic threat to the national security, and the safety of the American people”.

Rep. Green accused Mayorkas of refusing to enforce immigration laws passed by the U.S. Congress, defying multiple court orders, and lying under oath when he testified in front of Congress.

Due to these accusations, Republicans have announced plans for impeachment hearings against Secretary Mayorkas. On January 10, the House Homeland Security Committee will hold an impeachment hearing against Mayorkas.

Rep. Johnson and House Republicans appear resolute in their wish for H.R.2 to pass the Senate in its current form.

Rep. Johnson remarked that the trip to the border only made House Republicans “more resolved, to stand for sanity and the American people.”

Rep. Johnson ended his short speech by issuing an ultimatum to President Biden.

Johnson stated, “If President Biden wants a supplemental spending bill focused on national security, it had better begin by defending America’s national security. It begins here at the southern border.”"

Dec 14 2023,"Vivek Ramaswamy discusses age, immigration, and World War III at town hall",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/vivek-ramaswamy-age-immigration-town-hall,"Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy participated in a town hall Wednesday in Iowa, just over a month from the state’s Republican caucuses on Jan. 15.

Ramaswamy took questions from Iowa voters as part of a CNN town hall, touching on various topics, including his young age, former President Donald Trump, and immigration.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR CASE THAT COULD REVERSE JAN. 6 CHARGES AGAINST HUNDREDS, INCLUDING TRUMP

Ramaswamy began by addressing his similarities to Trump, using his age as a strength. He compared himself to Thomas Jefferson,

He then addressed immigration, saying that he would use the military to secure the border, cut off all aid to Central American countries that allowed illegal immigrants through toward the United States, and end incentives for illegal immigrants.

Taking a step ahead of the other candidates, aside from Trump, Ramaswamy called for the deportation of all illegal immigrants.

“I do believe that anybody who is in this country illegally needs to be returned to their country of origin,” he declared. “Not because they are all bad. Many of them are good people.”

Ramaswamy then advocated using local law enforcement to detain and deport illegal immigrants.

“Then there’s the question of how. This was the part many Republicans skip,” he said. “There’s 6,000 or so ICE agents. There’s a provision in the law — we don’t need new laws; it’s an existing law. It allows you to actually serve — an ICE agent to allow local law enforcement to serve warrants. That’s a million law enforcement officers. We can get that done. Again, all it takes is a president with a spine. If I swear an oath to the Constitution, I intend to keep it. That’s how I’m going to lead this country. I think that’s how we solve not only the border crisis but the abandonment of the rule of law in this country. That’s how I expect to lead.”

The political newcomer then addressed his stance on the War in Ukraine, which differs from most of his opponents. He reinforced his call for a “reasonable end to the Ukraine war,” which he believes includes a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“I don’t think [the war is] advancing our interests,” he said. “We’re spending $200 billion of our taxpayer money that would be better used to defend our border. Even worse, I believe it’s increasing the risk of World War III. It’s driving Russia further into China’s hands. I proposed a reasonable deal that would allow Ukraine to come out with sovereignty intact. Yes, with some territorial concessions of the Russian-speaking regions in eastern Ukraine.”

He compared the move to President Richard Nixon’s approach to China during the Cold War, when he warmed relations in order to drive them away from the Soviet Union.

“Do I trust Vladimir Putin? Of course not. He is a dictator? Absolutely. We will trust him to follow his self-interest just as he will trust us to follow ours,” he said. “Nixon did this in 1972. He pulled Mao out of the USSR. That was an alliance back then. Did we trust Mao? Of course we didn’t. There were kinks in the armor then. There are kinks in the armor now.”

“It’s going to take a visionary leader who will say we will use the Ukraine war as an opportunity to say to Russia, we will reopen some economic relations with Russia as Nixon did,” Ramaswamy continued. “But we will require no more joint military exercises, no more military sales between Russia and China. Weaken that alliance. Reduce the risk of World War III.”"

“Governor Abbott’s efforts to circumvent the federal immigration system and deny people the right to due process is not only unconstitutional, but also dangerously prone to error, and will disproportionately harm Black and Brown people regardless of their immigration status,” said Anand Balakrishnan, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU.

BREAKING: We’re suing to block Texas from enforcing the most extreme anti-immigrant law in the nation.



This unconstitutional law allows Texas judges to deport people and allows police to arrest people over suspicions about immigration status.



Texas, we'll see you in court. — ACLU (@ACLU) December 19, 2023

The federal government is responsible for immigration enforcement but Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the state had no choice because of President Biden’s “deliberate inaction"" on the border.

“President Biden has repeatedly refused to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books and do his job to secure the border,” the governor told Politico in a statement. “In his absence, Texas has the constitutional authority to secure our border through historic laws like SB 4.”

Abbott said his administration would defend the law all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.

In addition to the ACLU, the law has come under fire from Mexico’s president and The White House, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre calling SB 4 “an extreme law that will not and does not make the communities in Texas safer.”

The fight over immigration enforcement comes as more than 12,500 were encountered at the southern border on Monday, a record high, NewsNation reports."
Dec 20 2023,White House condemns Texas' criminalization of illegal immigration; other open-border leftists sue,The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/white-house-condemns-texas-criminalization-of-illegal-immigration,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott rankled the White House and other leftist outfits Monday by ratifying legislation that effectively makes illegal immigration a state crime.

While press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had some unkind words for Republicans seeking to curb criminality and to protect American sovereignty, the ACLU filed a lawsuit to prevent Senate Bill 4 from going into effect in March.

The law

SB4 would make illegal entry into the Lone Star State a class B misdemeanor as well as allow for foreign nationals who refuse to leave the country to be charged with a second-degree felony, which carries prison time of up to 20 years.

Under the law, which may ultimately go before the Supreme Court for review, illegal aliens found in Texas ""at any time"" who have previously been convicted of two or more misdemeanors involving drugs, crimes against a person, or both would be charged with a third-degree felony.

""Four years ago, the United States had the fewest illegal border crossings in decades,"" Abbott said in a statement Monday. ""It was because of four policies put in place by the Trump administration that led to such a low number of illegal crossings. President Biden has eliminated all of those policies and done nothing to halt illegal immigration.""

Over 6.6 million illegal aliens have illegally crossed the border since President Joe Biden took office.

Abbott noted Tuesday on X, ""Texas will continue stepping up until we have a new president who will enforce the law.""

Biden White House condemns the law

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre lashed out at Texas and Republicans during Tuesday's press briefing, calling SB4 ""an extreme law that will not and does not make the communities in Texas safer. It just doesn't.""

""I think to add to that is that it is very much in line with what Republicans — many Republicans like to do or tend to do, which is dema-, de-, de-, demonize immigrants and also dehumanize immigrants,"" continued Jean-Pierre. ""This is part of this. And so, uh, this is not who we are as a country. This is not who we should be as a country. Communities should not, should not be individually targeted and put into harm's way.""

The press secretary then suggested that Abbott has previously put illegal aliens who voluntarily steal into the nation in harm's way by installing border defenses and ""leaving migrants in the side of the road in the middle of winter.""

""This is certainly extreme, as we see it. And it is incredibly unfortunate. But this is what we see from particular Republicans trying to dehumanize a group of people who are coming here or some of them trying to migrate here. And — and they're putting them in harm’s way. They're putting them in harm's way,"" added Jean-Pierre.

A reporter raised the matter of the ACLU of Texas' lawsuit against Texas over SB4 and pressed Jean-Pierre over whether the Biden Department of Justice will similarly seek to preclude the Lone Star State from doing the work the Biden administration appears unwilling to do.

""So, Department of Justice, they're going to decide whether they're going to file a lawsuit here,"" said Jean-Pierre. ""Certainly, I'm not going to get ahead of that.""

The press secretary refused to indicate whether she was concerned that the current conservative-leaning Supreme Court might overrule the court's 2012 ruling in Arizona v. United States and/or give Texas a win over SB4, stating only, ""There is precedent. It was struck down. I can't speak for this current Court.""

ACLU sues to axe the law

The ACLU, the ACLU of Texas, and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed a lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of El Paso County and two groups that aid illegal aliens, namely Las Americas and American Gateways.It appears the plaintiffs would prefer to see the ability to clamp down on illegal immigration kept in the hands of those who refuse to wield it.

The lawsuit claims that SB4 violates the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and usurps federal authority by enabling state and local law enforcement officers to enforce immigration law. Invoking Arizona v. United States, the complaint further stresses that the federal government has exclusive power over immigration.

According to the complaint, SB4 will ""frustrate"" the groups' ability to work with de facto criminals by sending border-crossers packing or into hiding.

Rochelle Garza, the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, said in a statement, ""SB 4 is unconstitutional and paints a target on the friends & loved ones of all undocumented Texans to be profiled, stopped, or arrested by law enforcement.""

The ACLU said in a statement, ""We're suing to block Texas from enforcing the most extreme anti-immigrant law in the nation. This unconstitutional law allows Texas judges to deport people and allows police to arrest people over suspicions about immigration status.""

If successful in its legal challenge, the ACLU will deliver at least one foreign power a victory.

Blaze News previously reported that Mexican officials are opposed to SB4, noting in a Nov. 15 statement that ""the Government of Mexico categorically rejects any measure that allows state or local authorities to detain and return Mexican or foreign nationals to Mexican territory.""

Dec 15 2023,"Fetterman bluntly admits ‘I’m not a progressive’ as he angers far-left with stances on Israel, immigration",Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-bluntly-admits-progressive-angers-far-left-stances-israel-immigration,"Join Fox News for access to this content Plus special access to select articles and other premium content with your account - free of charge. Please enter a valid email address.

After months of left-wing frustration with Sen. John Fetterman’s, D-Penn., over his pro-Israel stance, the lawmaker officially declared he does not align with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party.

In an interview with NBC News, the freshman U.S. senator said, ""I’m not a progressive,"" and explained how he differs with leftists in the party on the subjects of Israel and illegal immigration.

""I just think I’m a Democrat that is very committed to choice and other things. But with Israel, I’m going to be on the right side of that. And immigration is something near and dear to me, and I think we do have to effectively address it as well,"" Fetterman said.

JOHN FETTERMAN SAYS HE'S FEELING LIBERATED AFTER BRUSH WITH DEATH, RIPS FELLOW DEMOCRATS

Fetterman’s words come after weeks of him taking notably non-leftist positions on hot topics of the day.

Where many in the party have sympathized with the Palestinian’s struggles amid the Israel-Hamas War and have called for a ""cease-fire"" in the conflict, Fetterman has openly supported Israel’s right to defend itself, and has even mocked progressive protesters demanding he speak out against Israel’s war effort.

That's earned the ire of some of the far-left voices in the party and even former staffers who say they feel betrayed.

Separating from Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on the issue, NBC noted, ""Fetterman’s fierce and unwavering support for Israel breaks sharply with demands by Sanders to withdraw U.S. military aid and has drawn searing criticism from the left as the Palestinian death toll soars amid the Israeli government’s bombing campaign in retaliation for the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.""

He also has freely criticized his party for not pushing out Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who was federally indicted for alleged involvement in a bribery scheme, in addition to bucking the party on calls for stronger border security.

Ripping Menendez, he told NBC, ""He needs to go. I don’t understand why he can be here, having expelled [George] Santos. But I’m sure there might be a very innocent explanation of having gold bars in your mattress and overstuffed envelopes of cash.""

FETTERMAN HITS NEWSOM FOR NOT HAVING 'GUTS' TO ADMIT HE'S RUNNING SHADOW CAMPAIGN AGAINST BIDEN

The outlet also mentioned his unique stance on immigration.

""Fetterman insisted he can be pro-immigration while also favoring policies to restrict the flow of migration to manageable levels, disagreeing with progressives who oppose new limits on asylum and bash some of the ideas in the negotiations as cruel,"" NBC reported.

He told NBC, ""It’s a reasonable conversation — until somebody can say there’s an explanation on what we can do when 270,000 people are being encountered on the border, not including the ones, of course, that we don’t know about.""

""To put that in reference, that is essentially the size of Pittsburgh, the second-largest city in Pennsylvania,"" he added.

He continues to vote with President Biden's policies the vast majority of the time, however.

Fetterman was elected last year after a difficult 2022 race made more complicated by a stroke that nearly killed him and continues to make it difficult for him to process conversations. He also suffered from depression as a result and had to check into a hospital shortly after taking office this year.

Left-wing outlet The New Republic wrote Friday that Fetterman had ""officially divorced himself from the progressive movement.""

However, his chief of staff Adam Jentleson said he’s ""always had"" these positions.

""He’s just being consistent,"" Jentleson told NBC News, adding, ""He spent the entire campaign telling people he wasn’t a down-the-line lefty."""
Dec 20 2023,Immigration rights groups sue Texas after Abbott signs ‘show your papers’ bill into law,MLive.com,center,https://mlive.com/reckon/2023/12/immigration-rights-groups-sue-texas-after-abbott-signs-show-your-papers-bill-into-law.html,"A roundup of conversations we're having daily on the site. Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.

Immigrant rights organizations are suing Texas after Gov. Greg Abbott signed a law on Monday that will allow local law enforcement to arrest anyone suspected of entering the state without federal authorization. Advocates say it is one of the most “extreme” immigration bills in the country.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project filed a lawsuit on Tuesday stating the law is unconstitutional and contradicts federal immigration policy. The County of El Paso, Texas; Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and nonprofit American Gateways are also challenging the legislation.

“The fear that this stokes in communities, that’s the point of legislation like this,” Aron Thorn, senior attorney for the Beyond Borders Program at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told Reckon. “Millions of Texans in really robust border communities — folks who have lived here for many years — are right to be concerned about what it will look like for them when this goes into effect.”

Texas Senate Bill 4 has been referred to by immigrant advocates as a “show your papers” law that will cause racial profiling. The legislation has received massive pushback from immigrant rights groups and leaders and is expected to set up a “showdown” between the state and federal government heading into next year.

Three new state laws were created under the bill, creating new offenses that can only be committed by people designated as “aliens,” according to the ACLU. These charges include: illegal entry from a foreign nation, illegal reentry by certain noncitizens and refusal to comply with an order to leave the country and carry misdemeanor and second-degree felony penalties.

Texas judges could immediately deport arrested undocumented people “in lieu of continuing the prosecution.”

Enforcement is prohibited on school grounds, places of religious worship and healthcare facilities. If not blocked by courts, the law will go into effect on March 5.

“Under this novel system, the State of Texas has created its own immigration entry and re-entry crimes,” the complaint reads. “The federal government has no role in, and no control over, Texas’s scheme.”

Advocates believe enforcement will impact not just border communities but all Texans across the state, with people of color more at risk of arrest, jailing and deportation.

“We’re suing to block one of the most extreme anti-immigrant bills in the country,” said Adriana Piñon, the legal director of the ACLU of Texas, in a statement. “Time and time again, elected officials in Texas have ignored their constituents and opted for white supremacist rhetoric and mass incarceration instead.”

Abbott, like other Republican governors, has been embroiled in a battle with the Biden Administration over U.S. immigration policy, with “migrant encounters” at the U.S.-Mexico border this year reaching a new historic high at 2.5 million, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

Advocates said people have been used as pawns, with Texas bussing more than 80,000 refugees to states like California and New York as of December. On Tuesday, an appeals court barred border patrol from removing razor wire along the Rio Grande, signifying a win for Abbott’s policies to deter migration into the state. The barriers force migrants to go through concertina wire, putting them at risk of bodily injury.

Texas Congressional Democrats and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in a letter on Monday urged the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue legal action to prevent enforcement of SB 4 citing concerns over violations of due process rights, asylum case obstruction and endangerment.

“SB 4 is an unlawful attempt to engage in federal immigration enforcement. This law will also interfere with federal efforts to create a safe, humane, and orderly system at the border,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter.

Advocates in Texas and in neighboring states have issued a travel advisory because of “anti-immigrant actions.”

Greg Chen, the senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said immigration policies like this could negatively impact people all across the nation, including families and communities of mixed statuses.

“We’re no longer just in this phase of border management,” he said on Friday during a press conference with other immigration advocates. “People could be deported without due process and it’s important to realize that this will be family separation version 2.0.”

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday that his government will challenge the law, which he called “inhumane,” Reuters reported. The Mexican government has opposed the legislation since prior to its signing, calling it an “anti-immigrant measure that aims to stop the flow of migrants by criminalizing them” in a November news release."

Congressional lawmakers remain unable to reach an agreement on a foreign aid bill for both Israel and Ukraine.

Senate Republicans blocked a key procedural vote Wednesday, insisting additional support for Ukraine must be tied to U.S. border security and a part of any package sent to the Senate floor.

""As we've said for weeks, legislation that does not include policy changes to secure the border will not pass the Senate,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).

Democrats say they've yet to receive a border package from Republicans that will pass the Senate, and accuse the ""radical right"" of holding Ukraine aid hostage.

""We cannot waste time on something like H.R. 2, which every single Democrat voted against, which could never pass the House, while the clock is ticking to get Ukraine the help it so desperately needs,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said.

In an impromptu public address on Wednesday, President Biden said the inaction of Congress is a gift to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""We can't let Putin win. I'll say it again. We can't let Putin win. It's in our overwhelming national interest and in the international interest of all our friends. Any disruption in our ability to supply Ukraine clearly strengthens Putin's position,"" Biden said.

""Republicans are playing hardball and they know they have a better negotiating position if they can get it to fail first. To have Democrats (say) 'Oh, my goodness, we really could run out of money here on Ukraine and the war there if we don't get serious on border secure funding,' that's what this is all about,"" said CBN News Chief Political Analyst David Brody.

Brody believes Democrats will have to go back to the negotiating table on border security to stand a chance at getting a funding bill through not only the Senate but also the House.

""The Republicans want concrete, specific policy proposals, so to speak, inside that bill. They don't want just money. They want actual things, tangible things, that are going to be done to stop the flow of immigrants, illegal immigrants, into the country,"" said Brody.

The blame game is strong right now with Democrats accusing Republicans of putting American safety and global democracy at risk.

However, Republicans maintain national security starts at home.

Dec 19 2023,Civil rights groups file federal lawsuit against new Texas immigration law SB 4,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/texas/news/sb4-texas-immigration-law-aclu-federal-lawsuit,"AUSTIN -- Civil rights organizations on Tuesday filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a new Texas law that would allow police to arrest migrants who cross the border illegally and permit local judges to order them to leave the country.

The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Austin, argues that the measure that is set to take effect in March is unconstitutional because the federal government has sole authority over immigration.

The American Civil Liberties Union, its Texas branch, and the Texas Civil Rights Project sued less than 24 hours after Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the measure during a ceremony on the U.S.-Mexico border in Brownsville.

The civil rights groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of El Paso County and two immigrant aid groups seeking to block enforcement of the measure, known as SB 4, and declare it unlawful.

""S.B. 4 creates a new state system to regulate immigration that completely bypasses and conflicts with the federal system,"" the lawsuit states.

The lawsuit was filed against the head of the Texas Department of Public Safety, whose troopers could arrest migrants, and the El Paso County district attorney, whose office would potentially prosecute cases in that border community.

A DPS spokesperson declined to comment in an email Tuesday, citing the pending litigation. Abbott's office did not return an email seeking comment. A person who answered the phone in Hicks' office said he was not available and had no immediate comment.

Abbott and other Texas Republicans who support the measure say President Joe Biden's administration isn't doing enough to control the 1,950-mile southern border. During Monday's ceremony where he signed the measure, Abbott expressed confidence that it would withstand legal challenges.

According to the lawsuit, DPS Director Steve McGraw told lawmakers that his agency estimates approximately 72,000 arrests will be made each year under the measure.

The new law allows any Texas law enforcement officer to arrest people who are suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody, they could either agree to a Texas judge's order to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges of illegal entry. Migrants who don't leave could face arrest again under more serious felony charges.

Opponents have called the measure the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since a 2010 Arizona law — denounced by critics as the ""Show Me Your Papers"" bill — that was largely struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. The lawsuit cites the 2012 Supreme Court decision on the Arizona law, which stated the federal government has exclusive power over immigration.

""The bill overrides bedrock constitutional principles and flouts federal immigration law while harming Texans, in particular Brown and Black communities,"" Adriana Piñon, legal director of the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement.

Earlier Tuesday, ACLU affiliates in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arkansas, Louisiana, Arizona, Texas, and San Diego and Imperial Counties in California issued a travel advisory warning of a possible threat to travelers' civil and constitutional rights violations when passing through Texas.

Other steps Texas has taken as part of Abbott's border security efforts have included busing more than 65,000 migrants to cities across America since August 2022 and installing razor wire along the banks of the Rio Grande."
Dec 19 2023,"Texas Governor Signs Law Challenging Biden Immigration Policies, Empowering State Law Enforcement",Worthy News,center,https://worthynews.com/91740-texas-governor-signs-law-challenging-biden-immigration-policies-empowering-state-law-enforcement,"by Emmitt Barry, Worthy News Correspondent

(Worthy News) – Republican Governor Greg Abbott of Texas has signed a new bill granting police the authority to detain illegal immigrants. This legislation also empowers local judges to order their departure from the country. This move aims to combat the influx of illegal immigration that has overwhelmed the state since the onset of the Biden Administration, challenging the extent to which a state can enforce immigration laws.

The bill specifies that once illegal migrants are detained by police, they have the option to comply with a Texas judge’s order to exit the U.S. or face misdemeanor charges for illegal entry. Migrants who fail to comply with the order may be subject to re-arrest and potentially face more severe felony charges.

During the signing ceremony, Gov. Abbott stated that the purpose of the law was to “stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas.”

The Republican governor has approved an additional bill, providing $1.5 billion for the extension of the border wall. This initiative seeks to continue the construction initiated by President Trump, which was subsequently discontinued under President Biden’s administration.

These actions are an expansion of Gov. Abbott’s Operation Lone Star, an initiative that saw state law enforcement agents dispatched to the border, the construction of 16 miles of wall, the installation of 110 miles of razor wire, and the transportation of over 80,000 migrants to sanctuary cities nationwide.

This law introduces an additional point of contention in the ongoing debate over immigration, set against the backdrop of a challenging negotiation process between the White House and Republicans regarding border security. Congressional Republicans are insisting on a immigration legislation overhaul as a precondition for their support on matters related to national security, including assistance to Ukraine, Israel, and other key areas.

Critics have labeled this new policy as the most extreme effort by a state to regulate immigration since Arizona’s 2010 legislation, which faced widespread denunciation as the “Show Me Your Papers” bill and was mostly invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Given that immigration laws are under federal jurisdiction, the new Texas law is anticipated to quickly face legal challenges.

Immediately following Governor Abbott’s signing of the new law, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas announced its intention to contest the measure in court. Additionally, over 20 Democratic members of Congress have signed a letter calling on the U.S. Justice Department to file a lawsuit to halt the enforcement of the law, also referred to as Senate Bill 4.

Dec 28 2023,DOJ threatens to sue Texas over anti-illegal immigration law; Abbott prepared for Supreme Court fight,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/doj-threatens-sue-texas-over-anti-illegal-immigration-law-abbott-prepared-scotus,"The Biden administration on Thursday threatened to sue Texas if it moves forward with a new anti-illegal immigration law signed this month by Gov. Greg Abbott – but the Republican governor says he is prepared to take the fight to the Supreme Court.

Abbott signed the legislation, SB 4, this month, which allows law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants and allows state judges to order them removed from the country.

In a letter to Abbott, first reported by the Houston Chronicle, the Department of Justice says it will ""pursue all appropriate legal remedies to ensure that Texas does not interfere with the functions of the federal government.""

TEXAS IMMIGRATION LAW PUSHBACK MARKS LATEST TENSION BETWEEN BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND BORDER STATES OVER CRISIS

The letter, obtained by Fox News Digital, says that the law ""intrudes into a field that is occupied by the federal government and is preempted,"" citing a 2012 Supreme Court ruling, Arizona v U.S. which found that the federal government has broad power to enforce immigration law.

""Because SB 4 is unconstitutional and will disrupt the federal government’s operations, we request that Texas forbear in its enforcement,"" it says.

The letter says that the DOJ intends to bring a lawsuit ""to enforce the supremacy of federal law and to enjoin the operation of SB 4"" unless Texas confirms by Jan. 3 that it is stopping enforcement of the legislation.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Abbott’s office said Texas was prepared to go to the nation’s highest court in defense of the legislation.

""Texas is prepared to take this fight all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to protect Texans and Americans from President Biden’s open border policies,"" spokesperson Renae Eze said. ""President Biden’s deliberate and dangerous inaction at our southern border has left Texas to fend for itself. Governor Abbott signed Senate Bill 4 into law last week to help stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas as the President refuses to enforce federal immigration laws.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SIGNS BILL MAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION A STATE CRIME

The legal battle is the latest clash between Abbott and the Biden administration over the illegal immigrant crisis at the border, of which Texas has been on the front line. Abbott has accused the Biden administration of failing to secure the border, while the administration has accused Abbott of promoting inhumane policies at the border.

Last week a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the Biden administration from cutting razor wire set up by Texas earlier this year. The state had sued in October and had been rebuffed by a federal judge, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals barred the Biden administration from damaging, destroying, or otherwise interfering with Texas’s [concertina wire] fence in the vicinity of Eagle Pass, Texas"" unless it is for a medical emergency.

Separately, the DOJ has sued Texas over its deployment of buoys in the Rio Grande to stop illegal crossings. Texas says the buoys are designed to save lives by preventing people from entering the river, but humanitarian groups and the DOJ argue the barrier poses a safety risk.

The White House has also criticized Abbott for his moves to bus migrants to ""sanctuary"" cities, including Chicago and New York City, which Abbott says is necessary to relieve overwhelmed border communities.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT BLOCKS BIDEN ADMIN FROM REMOVING TEXAS' RAZOR WIRE AT SOUTHERN BORDER

""We believe that Gov. Abbott's policies and political stunts are not safe, not safe for Texas communities and our CBP, our law enforcement on the ground who are trying to do their work. It puts them in harm's way, and they dehumanize and demonize immigrants. That's what his political stunts do,"" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said last week.

The threat of a new lawsuit comes as the border is again seeing record numbers at the border. Fox News reported this week that during the four-day Christmas weekend, there were more than 35,000 migrant encounters, and since Dec. 1, there have been over 250,000 migrant encounters at the southern border.

Nov 16 2023,'Devastating' and Possibly Unconstitutional: Texas Lawmakers Approve Anti-Immigration Bills,Dallas Observer,not-yet-rated,https://dallasobserver.com/news/texas-lawmakers-approve-strict-new-anti-immigration-bills-17897555,"Two bills passed in the Texas House of Representatives on Tuesday night aim to allocate more than $1.5 billion for additional border security measures and to make it a state crime to enter the country illegally from Mexico. Senate Bill 3 , which was filed by state Sen. Joan Huffman, a Houston Republican, calls for $1.54 billion to be spent on more border barriers and to fund more state troopers to patrol a housing development near Houston called Colony Ridge. Senate Bill 4 , which was filed by state Sen. Charles Perry, a Lubbock Republican, would make it a state misdemeanor to illegally cross the Texas-Mexico border.SB 4 is headed to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk, where he’s likely to sign it. SB 3 is going back to the Senate for members to vote on an amended version of the bill.Under SB 4, if an undocumented immigrant is arrested, they’ll be ordered by a judge to leave the U.S. in lieu of prosecution. If they’re accused of other crimes or they violate the judge’s order, they could get charged with a felony.One of the bill’s sponsors, state Rep. David Spiller, a Republican from Jacksboro, called SB 4 the strongest border security bill in the nation. “I’m proud to lead the charge on this landmark legislation as it will be sent to Governor [Greg Abbott’s] desk,” Spiller wrote on X Meanwhile, the Texas ACLU is threatening to sue the state if SB 4 is signed into law. Oni K. Blair, executive director at the ACLU of Texas, said in a statement that politicians in the state have pushed through some of the most radical anti-immigration bills ever passed in the country. “This legislation is completely out of touch with our values and who we aspire to be as Texans,” Blair said.She said SB 4 overrides federal immigration law, fuels racial profiling and harassment and gives state officials the unconstitutional ability to deport people without due process or regard for their eligibility for various humanitarian protections. “If signed into law, these bills will directly harm people seeking asylum, Black and Brown communities, and the core principles of our democracy,” Blair said. “It’s shameful that the governor and his allies are wasting taxpayer money on this unlawful cruelty instead of addressing our real needs: keeping the lights on, our schools open, and our teachers paid.”She added: “Texans across the state have resoundingly opposed these bills from the beginning and we’re not backing down. If Gov. Abbott signs SB 4 (88-4) into law, we will sue.”David Donatti, senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Texas, told theit’s important to recognize that lawmakers from both parties have acknowledged SB 4 is unconstitutional. There are a few reasons for that, he said. One of the most important ones is that immigration enforcement is a federal job. “As long as immigration controls have existed, since the 19th century, the Supreme Court has said over and over again that immigration regulation and enforcement is exclusively a federal prerogative,” Donatti said. “This law directly contradicts that mandate.”He later noted: “It’s going to be a fight not just in court but outside of it to keep people safe in what is increasingly a dangerous environment for all of us, especially people of color in the state of Texas.”Donatti said there have been similar bills filed in the past. About a decade ago Senate Bill 1070 in Arizona was passed, making it illegal to not carry immigration papers. It also required police to investigate the immigration status of whoever they came in contact with. According to The Texas Tribune , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that local police didn’t have the authority to arrest people on the basis of their immigration status and that this responsibility lied in the hands of the federal government.“Texas’ bill goes beyond what Arizona passed,” Donatti said.If Gov. Greg Abbott ’s X account is any indication, the controversial bill will get signed. “I look forward to signing Senate Bill 4, which creates penalties for illegal entry into Texas and authorizes the removal of illegal immigrants apprehended at the border.” He congratulated Sen. Perry and House Rep. Spiller for what he called “historic progress for border security.”State Rep. Venton Jones, a Dallas Democrat, told thehe was disappointed by SB 4’s passage on the House floor. “This legislation makes Black and Brown Texans less safe, codifies racial profiling, and will cost taxpayers and local governments millions in unfunded mandates,” he said. “I will continue fighting for Texans, ALL Texans, to feel safe in their homes and in their own skin.”Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa shared a similar view. “This is nothing short of codified hate, all so Greg Abbott and Dan Patrick can tout DPS and Operation Lone Star soundbites for Fox News,” Hinojosa said in a statement.“This will not fix the real security issues along the southern border,” Hinojosa said. “This will not keep Texans safe. This will do nothing but rip families apart and overcrowd our prisons – which is what Texas Republicans do best.”Denisse Molina, humanitarian outreach coordinator for the Beyond Borders Program at the Texas Civil Rights Project, told thethe motivation behind SB 4 is clear. It’s to “create an entirely new, separate, and unequal state immigration system in the United State,” Molina said. She said it’s a clear attempt to challenge the Supreme Court case regarding Arizona's SB 1070.Molina explained that if SB 4 is allowed to be implemented, it could set a precedent for other states. “This bill could cause a ripple effect for other states to try the same tactics Texas did, which will only create harm and confusion,” she said.To her, bills like SB 4 are meant to sow fear and anxiety among immigrant and mixed-status communities. But she thinks the law won’t impact only immigrant communities. She said the organization anticipates the impacts of the bill will be devastating, with massive human and civil rights violations, increased racial profiling and fear throughout communities of color.""The impact is on everyone that does not look white,” Molina said.“There will be disruptions in people’s lives as they learn how to navigate the law and the criminal system the law aims to trap them in,” Molina said. “This law is an attack on everyone including U.S. citizens and that is why this legislation is so dangerous.”"
Dec 13 2023,"DeSantis' top moments on Israel, immigration, Trump and Haley at CNN town hall: 'An easy answer'",Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/watch-desantis-top-moments-immigration-trump-haley-cnn-town-hall-an-easy-answer,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis took part in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night discussing a wide range of topics with top moments that included immigration, funding overseas conflicts, former President Donald Trump, and the state of the GOP race.

DeSantis on taxpayer funding to Israel vs Ukraine

DeSantis was asked by a member of the audience which conflict was most worthy of United States support: Israel or Ukraine.

""That's an easy answer. It's the state of Israel, they are our strongest allies in the Middle East,"" DeSantis said, later adding that ""in terms of the two-state solution, I don't think you can have a two-state solution when the Palestinian Arabs will view it as a stepping stone to the destruction of Israel.""

The Florida governor also discussed focusing on the ongoing crisis at the southern border before looking overseas.

DeSantis on the crisis at the southern border

""Day one, we're going to declare it a national emergency. I'm sending the military to the southern border. We're going to stop the invasion,"" DeSantis said when speaking about the ongoing border crisis, before making a repeated complaint about Trump's handling of border wall contruction.

""If Trump had built the border wall, it would have been very difficult for Biden to bring in all those many people,"" DeSantis told Tapper, echoing his campaign pledge to tax remittances from Mexico to pay for a border wall and criticizing Trump for not completing a wall.

""Talk is cheap and I’m sick of Republicans using the issue every election cycle to try to get donations and to try to tell the people they're going to do it. We are going to bring the issue to a conclusion.""

DeSantis goes after Trump

DeSantis continued to take several swings at Trump, who currently holds a commanding lead in polls both in Iowa and nationally, before saying he is the ""only"" GOP candidate who could beat the former president for the nomination.

""I'm the only one running that can beat Trump one on one. Why? Because the other candidates cannot get enough support from core Republicans and transitional conservatives.""

""He's a different Donald Trump than 2015 and 2016. Back then he was colorful, but it was really America first about the policies. Now a lot of it's about him,"" DeSantis told Tapper, before calling out the former president not participating in any of the four presidential primary debates.

DeSantis also hit Trump on abortion, saying that Trump ""flip-flopped"" on the ""right to life"" issue.

DeSantis pledges ‘reckoning’ for government health agencies

On healthcare, DeSantis criticized Trump again for saying during his 2016 campaign he was going to repeal Obamacare, but failing to accomplish it.

DeSantis said ""they failed because they didn't have anything to replace it with."" The DeSantis campaign would be releasing a healthcare policy plan in the future, the governor said.

The Republican noted that he believes ""the biggest health care issue we've had in this country in the last four or five years is COVID-19,"" adding that ""I am going to bring a reckoning to those agencies that lied to this country, the CDC, NIH, FDA, people like Fauci, all those things that really harm this country. And yet nobody's been held accountable.""

""Another thing we're going to deal with because health care, the biggest health care issue we've had in this country in the last four or five years is COVID 19. I am going to bring a reckoning to those agencies that lied to this country, the CDC, NIH, FDA, people like Fauci, all those things that really harm this country. And yet nobody's been held accountable.""

DeSantis targets Haley

DeSantis used some of his time to criticize former Ambassador Nikki Haley, who many believe represents his biggest challenge in terms of positioning himself as the alternative to Trump, on issues like social security.

The Florida governor took another jab at Haley after her key endorsement from Gov. Chris Sununu, R-N.H., Tuesday.

""Even a campaigner as good as Chris is not going to be able to paper over Nikki being an establishment candidate. I mean, she's getting funded by liberal Democrats from California, like the founder of LinkedIn, people on Wall Street like the head of JP Morgan,"" DeSantis said. ""She's really reflective of the old failed Republican establishment of yesteryear. We do not need to go back to that.""

DeSantis was also asked about his wife Casey's successful battle against breast cancer and he praised her decision to get a second opinion after a doctor told her she was cleared but she still felt something was wrong and ""really fought for herself.""

""When you see somebody that you love go through the chemo and it just sucks the life out of you and everything she had to go through, as a husband, I’m there doing what I can to be the helping hand and to help with the family and everything,"" DeSantis said.

""But you almost wish I could do a chemo for her so she didn’t have to do it all this time. But it was not fun, but I'd say she's better than ever now with her health. So that's really all that matters. People's prayers were answered.""

The Real Clear Politics average of polls in Iowa shows DeSantis with 19.7% of the vote — in second place behind Trump, who is polling at 50%, and ahead of former Ambassador Nikki Haley who is polling in third at 15.7%."

Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged each other’s records on immigration, crime, COVID-19 lockdowns, the economy and social issues in a rowdy Fox News matchup billed as ""The Great Red versus Blue State Debate.""

DeSantis is among the Republicans running behind former President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Newsom, a Democrat, is not running for president — though he could be a future contender — and defended President Joe Biden’s record.

The governors in the debate, held in Alpharetta, Georgia, cherry-picked favorable data and talked over each other as moderator Sean Hannity flipped through topics. Newsom was telling ""a lot of whoppers,"" said DeSantis, whose props included a purported map of feces in San Francisco. (We fact-checked it at the end.)

""I can’t wait to get all the PolitiFacts tonight,"" Newsom said as they feuded over student learning.

Here are our fact-checks from their showdown.

Migration

DeSantis and Newsom went back and forth discussing their states’ population gains and losses.

""He’s the first governor to ever lose population,"" said DeSantis. ""They actually at one point ran out of U-Hauls in the state of California because so many people were leaving.""

California’s population declined for the first time ever in 2020, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. It’s been declining since then. (Newsom became governor in 2019). After the 2020 Census, California lost a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in its history.

In January 2022, U-Haul said that it ran out of one-way trucks and trailers in California at the start of 2021. This was a result of the large demand of people moving out of California in 2020, leaving fewer trucks, a U-Haul spokesperson told The Sacramento Bee.

Newsom countered that there have been ""more Floridians coming to California than the other way around in the last two years.""

If measuring per capita, Newsom is right that more Floridians have moved to California than the other way around in the last two years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. But the difference is so small that experts have questioned whether it is meaningful.

In 2022, 1.32 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, and 1.31 per 1,000 Californians moved to Florida.

In raw numbers, more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. But this does not account for California's higher population.

A 2023 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 45% of Californians who considered moving to another state cited housing costs as a factor.

COVID-19 lockdowns

Newsom borrowed a page from former President Donald Trump’s playbook by misleadingly portraying DeSantis as a lockdown leader. Newsom’s comments focused on DeSantis’ actions in the pandemic’s first few weeks, when nearly all governors operated in lockstep. Newsom omits that DeSantis reopen earlier than most governors in the spring of 2020.

""You passed an emergency declaration before the state of California did,"" Newsom said. ""You closed down your beaches, your bars, your restaurants. It is a fact.""

Many local governments closed beaches for a limited time, but DeSantis did not close them statewide.

DeSantis issued an executive order on March 17, 2020, directing Floridians to ""limit their gatherings"" at beaches to no more than 10 people and to ""support beach closures at the discretion of local authorities.""

He also ordered beaches in Broward and Palm Beach counties to close for 11 days, following recommendations from local officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The governor's refusal to close most beaches to spring break crowds drew heavy criticism and litigation.

Newsom was on firmer ground in his claim about closing bars. DeSantis ordered all bars and nightclubs closed for 30 days. Restaurants did not close. His March 17 order said restaurants were limited to 50% customer capacity and had to separate seating by 6 feet.

Governors nationwide issued multiple orders in March 2020 in response to the pandemic. DeSantis issued an order March 1 to establish COVID-19 response protocol and direct a public health emergency. On March 4, Newsom declared a state of emergency to help California prepare for COVID-19.

Book bans in Florida

When Hannity asked DeSantis about the Florida bill criticized as ""don’t say gay,"" DeSantis held up a page from the graphic memoir ""Gender Queer,"" with black markings over private parts. Many Florida school districts have banned the book.

Newsom said Florida had been on a ""book-banning binge"" under DeSantis: ""One thousand four hundred and six books have been banned just last year under Ron DeSantis’ leadership."" DeSantis replied that it was a ""false narrative.""

This stems from one group’s count and does not represent 1,406 books banned statewide.

PEN America, a group that opposes book bans, recorded 1,406 book ban cases in Florida across about half of the state’s school districts. PEN America’s definition of a ban is more expansive than those of other groups. The organization records a book ban whenever access to a previously available book is removed or restricted — temporarily or permanently — because of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions or direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials. Books that are removed temporarily may not return to shelves for months.

New Florida laws made it easier for parents to object to books, resulting in more school districts banning books in the past couple of years.

A September Florida Department of Education report shows 20 of Florida’s 67 school districts and the statewide public Florida Virtual School removed 298 books in the 2022-23 school year. Some of those books were banned in multiple districts. Overall, school district officials received 1,218 objections about books.

Many of the objections were for books containing sexual or LGBTQ+ content and came from a small group of parents, some affiliated with conservative groups, such as Moms for Liberty, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found.

Prompted by Hannity to say whether the bans were state or local, DeSantis said they were ""local."" That disguises state policy’s influence on local choices.

Newsom also said, ""What’s wrong with Amanda Gorman’s poetry?"" suggesting it was banned. A parent at a South Florida school challenged Gorman’s poem ""The Hill We Climb,"" which Gorman performed at Biden’s January 2021 inauguration. After a review, the K-through-eighth grade school moved the book to the library’s middle school section. It was not banned at the school, much less by the district or the state.

Tax policy

The governors sparred about taxes, with DeSantis asking how many people leave Florida for California because that state has a lower tax burden. ""They come to Florida because they pay lower taxes,"" DeSantis said.

But Newsom said Florida ""taxes low-income workers more than we tax millionaires and billionaires in the state of California.""

Newsom has a point, although the two states have such different tax systems that it’s tricky to compare them. For instance, Florida has no income tax, but California does.

Among the 50 states, Florida has the nation’s 11th-lowest overall tax burden, while California has the fifth-highest, according to annual rankings by the Tax Foundation, a think tank that advocates for lower taxes.

But the overall tax burden doesn’t address differences between workers’ share of taxes.

A study by the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy examined whether state tax systems rely on higher-income taxpayers (progressive) or lower-income taxpayers (regressive). Newsom’s office said this is the study he referred to. The data, though, is from 2018.

It found that in California, the top 1% of households for incomes paid 12.4% of their income in state and local taxes. By comparison, in Florida, households in the bottom 20% of incomes paid 12.7% of their income in state and local taxes. By this metric, Newsom is correct.

Comparing the tax burden for the lowest 20% of households in income, California also has lower taxes. In California, households in the bottom 20% paid 10.5% of their income in taxes, compared with Florida’s 12.7%.

Meanwhile, wealthy taxpayers came out ahead in Florida, where the tax burden for the top 1% was 2.3% of income. That’s far lower than the 12.4% rate for California millionaires.

Florida’s crime rate

As DeSantis described a conversation with Newsom’s father-in-law, who moved to Florida, he claimed Florida was experiencing a ""50-year low"" in the crime rate. Newsom said DeSantis’ ""own law enforcement"" said the data shouldn’t be used.

What used to be an easy talking point about Florida’s declining crime became controversial this year after the agency changed how it reported its crime rate.

NBC News reported Sept. 20 that DeSantis’ talking point came from a database with information from law enforcement agencies representing about 57% of Florida’s population. The story quoted three unnamed former Florida Department of Law Enforcement staff members who said they had warned top officials against using the ""50-year low"" claim, because it was impossible to verify.

Florida’s transitioned to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious crimes would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement told PolitiFact in September that the 50-year low statistic still holds after additional agencies submitted data, representing around 75% of the population.

The FBI’s crime reporting database shows that 49 of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. By contrast, in 2022, 367 Florida law enforcement agencies sent in data.

Florida’s abortion limits and DeSantis’ abortion survivor story

As Hannity pressed Newsom on whether he supported any abortion restrictions, Newsom attacked Florida’s abortion laws.

""He signed a bill banning any exceptions for rape and incest,"" Newsom said of DeSantis. ""And then he said it didn't go far enough and decided to sign a six-week ban … that criminalizes women and criminalizes doctors.""

DeSantis signed legislation in 2022 that outlawed abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It does not make exceptions for cases of incest, rape or human trafficking but includes an exception for the mother’s life.

DeSantis signed a stricter bill in April that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Whether the law takes effect hinges on how the Florida Supreme Court rules in a lawsuit against the current 15-week ban. The 2023 law does contain exceptions, including to save the woman’s life or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape, incest or human trafficking would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy if a woman has documentation, such as a restraining order, police report or medical record.

The law penalizes physicians, but whether it also criminalizes women is less clear, so we have rated a similar claim Half True. The law says that anyone who ""actively participates in"" an abortion commits a third-degree felony, which opens the door to prosecutors charging women, but we don’t yet know whether they will or how courts would respond to such charges. DeSantis has also said that he doesn’t want women prosecuted, only doctors.

Defending the law, DeSantis repeated an anecdote from the first GOP presidential debate about a Floridian named Penny Hopper. Hopper is a real person, and an anti-abortion activist. Some of the details about her birth story have been called into question.

Hopper said she survived an abortion attempt in Florida in 1955. Her claim has been featured by anti-abortion groups and used to support ""born alive"" bills in state legislatures, which aim to protect infants who survive abortions, even though there are federal laws for that purpose.

In a video and in interviews, Hopper said she had been delivered around 23 weeks gestation after her mother went to a hospital in Wauchula, Florida, while experiencing bleeding. Hopper said the doctor induced labor, and she was born at 1 pound, 11 ounces, and that the doctor told staff to discard her ""dead or alive."" She said her grandmother found her the next day on the hospital porch in a bedpan. Then, Hopper said, a nurse volunteered to take her to a larger hospital that was about 40 miles away.

That a baby born at 23 weeks could survive overnight without medical attention in 1955 is medically dubious, experts said. From the 1950s through 1980, ""newborn death was virtually ensured"" for infants born at or before 24 weeks of gestation, The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says on its website.

The Washington Post also reported that contemporaneous newspaper accounts offer a different scenario at the hospital, and said the staff spent days keeping her alive before arranging a police escort to rush her to another hospital.

Literacy rates and learning loss

DeSantis and Newsom each said their state handled education better during the pandemic.

DeSantis said that in the most recent results of a widely tracked standardized test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, ""Florida came in No. 3 for fourth grade reading. California was far, far behind.""

This is accurate. Florida ranked third among states for fourth grade reading, after Massachusetts and Wyoming. California ranked 32nd.

On eighth grade reading, Florida ranked 21st, but still led California, which ranked 29th.

Newsom, meanwhile, said, ""Ron DeSantis had more learning loss during COVID"" in Florida than he had in California.

Measuring learning loss is complicated and varies by academic subject and age. But one study that tried to quantify how much students backslid overall during the pandemic supports Newsom’s statement.

In January 2023, McKinsey & Co., a consulting company, released a study of how National Assessment of Educational Progress results changed in each state from 2019 to 2022.

In the study, a 4-point drop in scores on the test was estimated to have produced 12 weeks of learning delay. Learning loss varied widely by state, with Hawaii and Alabama experiencing four weeks of loss and Delaware experiencing 32 weeks.

The study found that California students lost an average of nine weeks, compared with 12 weeks for Florida. That put California slightly below the 12-week national average and Florida slightly above it.

DeSantis criticized California for having ""one of the lowest literacy rates in the country."" He is correct — but he ignored that Florida’s literacy rate is nearly as low.

The federal Education Department uses a few metrics to measure literacy. The most comprehensive, calculated by modeling several measurements of literacy, has a fairly narrow range, from 252 (the lowest, for Louisiana) to 279 (the highest, for New Hampshire).

California has the sixth-lowest score of any state (257). But Florida has the ninth-lowest score at 259.

Violent crime statistics

Hannity said California’s levels of violent crime are ""way higher than the national average."" He showed a graphic with 2022 violent crime rates, based on FBI data. California had the highest rate, with 499.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The national average was 380.7 per 100,000, and Florida’s was 258.9 per 100,000. We checked the numbers in the graphic and found they were accurate.

Newsom pushed back on this narrative by focusing on one category of violent crime: murders. The other types of violent crime include forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

""Seven of the top 10 murder rates in the United States of America are red states,"" Newsom said.

Newsom is right, based on the voting patterns in the 2020 presidential election and 2020 state-by-state homicide rankings, according to an analysis of federal data by Third Way, a center-left policy group.

In descending order, the top 10 states for homicide rates were Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Maryland and Georgia. The first seven on that list all supported Trump in the 2020 election; the final three supported President Joe Biden. The analysis also found that ""solidly red states have dominated the top 10 murder rate states for the past decade"" or more.

Newsom also said that Florida ""has a 66% higher gun death rate than the state of California.""

This is close. According to 2020 federal data, Florida’s gun death rate was 14.1 per 100,000 residents, compared with 9.0 per 100,000 in California. That’s 57% higher for Florida.

However, both governors can point to other statistics to bolster their case as the safer locale.

California’s overall homicide rate of 5.7 per 100,000 people was higher than Florida’s rate of 5.0 per 100,000. Both states rank below the national rate of 6.3.

Florida’s gun homicide rate, 5.87 per 100,000, was higher than California’s, 4.65.

Americans in Israel

DeSantis did not tell the full story of how the Biden administration evacuated Americans from Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

""Biden stranded a lot of American citizens over there who were trying to get home,"" DeSantis said. ""So, I did an executive order in Florida, and we sent planes over Israel right in the aftermath of Oct. 7, and we saved over 700 Americans, mostly Floridians, but not all, because Biden wouldn’t do it.""

About 700 Americans flew to Florida on four flights from Israel, DeSantis’ office said. The flights were free for passengers.

But the Biden administration also brought Americans home. It offered 6,900 seats to Americans in Israel seeking to depart by air, land or sea. As of Oct. 31, about 1,500 U.S. citizens and their family members had departed using federal government transport, a State Department spokesperson previously told PolitiFact.

The first flight landed in Athens, Greece. News reports said that the State Department flew Americans to European cities where they could book flights to the U.S. on commercial airlines. Florida officials offered to transport Americans who were in Athens to the U.S.

Per long-standing federal law and policy, the government seeks reimbursement from citizens for the cost of transportation.

Squabbling over Special Olympics

DeSantis and Newsom sparred over how the other treated the Special Olympics. Newsom said it was ""disgraceful"" that DeSantis threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million.

DeSantis fired back that Newsom ""wanted the athletes marginalized.""

What were they talking about?

In June 2022, ahead of a planned Special Olympics event in Orlando, the Florida Department of Health told the organization that its vaccine requirement conflicted with state law barring any business from asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination. After Florida threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million, the organization eliminated its vaccine requirement.

Florida’s action prompted ""an emotional response"" for Newsom, he told the Sacramento Bee. He tweeted: ""Ron DeSantis’ values on full display: Bullying. The. Special. Olympics.""

In response, DeSantis emphasized how lifting the vaccine requirement enabled some participants to participate in the games even though health concerns prevented them from getting vaccinated. He cited participants such as Isabella Valle, who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and a shunt in her brain.

Both governors have ties to the Special Olympics. Newsom headed the leadership committee for the Special Olympics’ World Games in Los Angeles in 2015, and his mother helped families adopt children with disabilities, the Bee reported.

DeSantis and his wife, Casey were honorary co-chairs of the 2022 Special Olympics.

Mapping human feces in San Francisco

During a conversation about homelessness, DeSantis pulled out a sheet of paper from his suit jacket and revealed a map of San Francisco filled with brown and black pinpoint icons.

During Red vs. Blue State #debate, @RonDeSantis showed @GavinNewsom our map of human feces all over San Francisco. It's just one of the many ways we track what you get for your tax $! Get the whole story here: https://t.co/XEKr29GXKE #transparencymatters https://t.co/jk47bNwDDE — OpenTheBooks (@open_the_books) December 1, 2023

""Well, this is an app where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of San Francisco,"" said DeSantis. ""And you see how almost the whole thing is covered? Because that is what has happened in one of the previous greatest cities this country's ever had. Human feces is now a fact of life.""

DeSantis’ map comes from Open the Books, a nonprofit government watchdog. But what DeSantis pointed to isn’t current.

The map plotted public reports of human feces found in San Francisco from 2011 to 2019. (More than 118,000 people reported their findings to San Francisco’s nonemergency line.)

Newsom was San Francisco mayor from 2004 to 2011 and was California’s lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2019.

Open the Books does not seem to have a map of current data. But there is another map created by two Los Angeles teachers, showing reports from July 2019 to July 2020. That map has fewer data points than the visual DeSantis offered.

Dec 20 2023,Texas immigration law pushback marks latest tension between Biden administration and border states over crisis,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/texas-immigration-law-marks-latest-in-tensions-between-biden-admin-border-states,"The White House described a new immigration law in Texas allowing law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants as ""extreme"" Tuesday, igniting the latest tension between the Biden administration and states at the southern border over its handling of the migrant crisis.

The new legislation, signed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott Monday, allows law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants, who would then face the choice to leave the U.S. or be prosecuted on misdemeanor charges for illegal entry.

Migrants who don't comply could face arrest again and more serious felony charges.

A White House spokesperson derided the new law as ""extreme"" and argued it ""will make communities in Texas less safe.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT SIGNS BILL MAKING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION A STATE CRIME

""Generally speaking, the federal government — not individual states — is charged with determining how and when to remove noncitizens for violating immigration laws,"" the spokesperson said.

""This is certainly extreme as we see it,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre emphasized Tuesday. ""And it is incredibly unfortunate.""

Gov. Abbott, however, said the law will ""better protect Texans AND Americans from Biden’s open border policies. ""

The tension between Texas and the administration was also on display Tuesday when a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the Biden administration from cutting razor wire set up by Texas earlier this year. The state had sued in October and had been rebuffed by a federal judge, but the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals barred the Biden administration from damaging, destroying, or otherwise interfering with Texas’s [concertina wire] fence in the vicinity of Eagle Pass, Texas"" unless it is for a medical emergency.

""[Attorney General Ken] Paxton and I will hold Biden and [DHS Secretary Aleandro] Mayorkas accountable for attacking Texas’ sovereign authority and their attempts to obstruct our border security efforts,"" Abbott said in a statement.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT BLOCKS BIDEN ADMIN FROM REMOVING TEXAS' RAZOR WIRE AT SOUTHERN BORDER

That legal battle is taking place alongside another legal battle between the Department of Justice and Texas over its deployment of buoys in the Rio Grande in Texas to stop migrants swimming across.

Texas says the buoys are designed to save lives by preventing people from entering the river, but humanitarian groups and the DOJ argue the barrier poses a safety risk.

""The State of Texas’s actions violate federal law, raise humanitarian concerns, present serious risks to public safety and the environment, and may interfere with the federal government’s ability to carry out its official duties,"" the DOJ said in a letter to Abbott before the suit was filed.

The same federal appeals court recently ruled Texas must remove 1,000 feet of the barrier, prompting Abbott to promise he will go to the Supreme Court if needed to get the barrier reinstalled. The White House has also criticized Abbott for his moves to bus migrants to ""sanctuary"" cities, including Chicago and New York City. Abbott has in turn accused the Biden administration of not doing its job to secure the southern border.

On Tuesday, the White House attacked Abbott over what it says are ""political stunts""

""We believe that Gov. Abbott's policies and political stunts are not safe, not safe for Texas communities and our CBP, our law enforcement on the ground who are trying to do their work. It puts them in harm's way, and they dehumanize and demonize immigrants. That's what his political stunts do,"" Jean-Pierre said.

SOUTHERN BORDER HIT BY RECORD NUMBER OF MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN A SINGLE DAY AS THOUSANDS FLOOD INTO TEXAS

But the administration has also taken heat in recent days from neighboring Arizona, where Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has fumed at what she has said is a lack of action from the federal government. On Friday, after pushing President Biden to reassign the Arizona National Guard to the Lukeville port of entry, which had been besieged by a new migrant wave, she announced she was herself mobilizing the Guard.

""Yet again, the federal government is refusing to do its job to secure our border and keep our communities safe,"" Hobbs said in a statement. ""With this executive order, I am taking action where the federal government won’t. But we can’t stand alone. Arizona needs resources and manpower to reopen the Lukeville crossing, manage the flow of migrants and maintain a secure, orderly and humane border.

""Despite continued requests for assistance, the Biden administration has refused to deliver desperately needed resources to Arizona’s border.""

The tension between the states and the federal government comes amid a new surge in migration at the border. Fox News reported this week that Monday saw a record high of migrant encounters at the southern border. Both the Tucson and Del Rio sectors had massive numbers in recent weeks.

The Biden administration has said it needs funding and reform from Congress to fix a ""broken"" system. Lawmakers in Washington are attempting to hash out a deal for emergency supplemental funding. The White House is requesting an additional $14 billion for the border, including $1.4 billion to states and communities receiving migrants.

But Republicans have said they want to see more limits on asylum and limits on the administration’s use of parole, which they see as drawing more migrants to the border. The administration has reportedly expressed openness to new expulsion authorities and additional detention, but lawmakers have said it is unlikely there will be a deal before the new year.

Nov 29 2023,Florida grand jury calls on state to track immigration status of arrestees in response to migrant crisis,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/florida-grand-jury-calls-on-state-to-track-immigration-status-of-arrestees,"A Florida grand jury empaneled after a request by Gov. Ron DeSantis to investigate human smuggling networks is calling for legislation to track the immigration status of those arrested in the state, as well as increased sentences for those who commit crimes after previously being deported.

""We believe Florida should begin tracking data regarding the immigration status of arrestees, and mandate its reporting to [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] for retention and publication,"" the grand jury’s fifth report says. ""We recommend that our leaders adopt a law requiring the Department of Corrections, each County Sheriff, and the Chief of Police of any law enforcement agency in this state to provide such data to FDLE along with the other data they are already sending.""

DeSantis filed a petition last year to the Florida Supreme Court, requesting it ""impanel a statewide grand jury to examine international human smuggling networks that bring aliens to the southern border, and ultimately to Florida.""

Previous reports have been scathing of the handling of the crisis by the federal government, including accusing the Biden administration of a ""complete abdication of responsibility"" for the welfare of children.

FLORIDA GRAND JURY ACCUSES BIDEN HHS OF ‘COMPLETE ABDICATION OF RESPONSIBILITY’ FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN WELFARE

This report, coming after 450 hours in session and more than 100 witnesses, said its mandate is not to rewrite federal law, but to explore the impact of any criminal activity on the state.

""The short answer is that there are most certainly crimes being committed, including by some of our fellow state residents, which abet transnational and local criminal organizations and individuals in their trafficking of people (including and especially children), criminal actors, fraudulent documents, and drugs into our state, extracting money in return,"" it says.

""These crimes are sometimes actually enabled by governmental agencies, policies, and activities; and there are things that can be done about them. We are also convinced that, because the driving forces are largely federal policies, and political incentives seem to not prioritize solving the problems, it will be up to Florida and other states to help themselves, at least in the short term.""

The lengthy 146-page report, which outlines an exhaustive list of crimes committed by smugglers and alleged dangers to the homeland, accuses non-governmental organizations of magnifying the ""magnetic illusion of economic prosperity at the end of a migratory trek"" by offering assistance to migrants.

""We have seen charts and advisory pamphlets showing aliens possible routes of travel (none of which warn, for example, that the territory about to be entered is controlled by violent cartels) handed out by NGOs,"" the report says. ""We have seen makeshift and expanded ‘camps’ set up as way stations in the middle of places like the Panamanian jungle to help ferry aliens up the Central American peninsula.""

It also cites reports of exploitation of migrants by cartels who are overseeing the migratory routes and helping migrants make their way to the border. It also points to evidence of child labor violations and other crimes related to smuggling including exploitation, as well as the large number of ""special interest aliens"" coming into the U.S.

""Absent the overheated rhetoric from all political angles, the situation truly is not complicated; individuals from other countries are enticed to come to this country, the overwhelming majority with no plausible claim to asylum whatsoever, and serious harm results on both sides of our border as the situation is exploited for crime and profit by cartels, funding by NGOs, and political clout-chasing by others. All the while, we and our fellow taxpayers pick up the tab.""

Ultimately, the grand jury found that Florida ""should wait no longer to protect its interests, its residents, and its immigrant population from the problems we have described.""

It recommends another grand jury be formed to investigate NGOs and provides other recommendations -- including a requirement that sponsors of unaccompanied children who are not parents or guardians be subject to a formal legal determination.

The report also recommends ""adding a sentencing enhancement provision…which would increase the exposure for those who have been previously deported and return to commit a felony offense in our state."" Separately, it says the cartels should be designated as foreign terrorist organizations.

Florida's legislature passed a sweeping anti-illegal immigration bill which includes provisions to bar driving licenses to illegal immigrants, mandate E-Verify, enhance penalties for smuggling and require hospitals to collect data on the cost of providing healthcare to illegal immigrants.

WHITE HOUSE FUNDING REQUEST INCLUDES $14 BILLION FOR BORDER AS CRISIS HITS NEW RECORDS

In a statement, Attorney General Ashley Moody said the report marked a ""damning indictment"" of the failure of the federal government to protect the border and the unaccompanied children being smuggling into the U.S.

""Not only is the administration jeopardizing the safety of unaccompanied minor children—they are letting terrorists and immigrants from countries of concern into the interior of the U.S.,"" she said. ""I want to thank the members of the Statewide Grand Jury for their dogged pursuit of the truth and for bringing to light how the Biden administration’s dangerous immigration policies are harming vulnerable populations.""

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has said it is working within the confines of a ""broken"" immigration system and has called on Congress to provide more funding and comprehensive immigration reform to fix that system.

Most recently it made a $14 billion request to Congress that would include migrant services and housing, anti-fentanyl technology and more border agents. It also includes money for DNA collection and over $1.9 billion for Health and Human Services ""to support eligible arrivals and unaccompanied children."""

(Rodrigo Buendia/AFP via Getty Images)

Taxpayers in New York City face sharp cuts to services—including education and policing—because the city has to find ways to fill a massive budget gap due to expenses from the illegal immigration crisis.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Thursday released a financial plan update for the fiscal year 2024, including a cost-cutting scheme called the “program to eliminate the gap” or PEG that balances the budget at the expense of services—including slashing the number of cops to their lowest level since the 1990s.

Mr. Adams, a former New York Police Department (NYPD) captain who was elected on the promise of making city streets safer, said in a video address that the costs of the illegal immigration crisis have put a “great strain” on the city’s budget and that the time has come for serious belt-tightening.

“For months, you’ve heard me talk about the fiscal challenges our city is facing as the costs of the asylum seeker humanitarian crisis have skyrocketed,” he said, adding that the city budget faces added pressure as COVID-19 stimulus funding is sunsetting.

New York City has already spent $1.45 billion on the illegal immigration crisis in fiscal year 2023 and unless it gets federal and state aid, it’s set to spend nearly $11 billion on the crisis over the next two years.

With the law demanding a balanced budget, Mr. Adams said “hard choices” have been made to cut services to keep the fiscal year 2024 budget of $110.5 billion balanced.

“While we pulled it off this time, make no mistake: Migrant costs are going up, tax revenue growth is slowing, and COVID stimulus funding is drying up,” Mr. Adams said in a statement.

“No city should be left to handle a national humanitarian crisis largely on its own, and without the significant and timely support we need from Washington, D.C., today’s budget will be only the beginning.”

In order to meet the skyrocketing costs of the illegal immigration crisis, the city has added $6.2 billion over the fiscal years 2024 and 2025, bringing the total funds budgeted for the needs of the immigration crisis over two fiscal years to a whopping $10.8 billion.

The Cuts

Overall, the city has implemented a 5 percent across-the-board cut affecting every city agency, with the spending reductions in the PEG amounting to $3.7 billion over two fiscal years.

The cuts are, by most accounts, rather drastic. Most of New York City’s public libraries will no longer stay open on Sundays, the city’s universal pre-kindergarten program is being squeezed, and sanitation services will suffer.

“This is the most painful exercise I’ve ever done in my professional life,” Mr. Adams said during a town hall for older adults on Thursday.

But it’s perhaps in the area of public safety that the cuts will be most painful.

Mr. Adams’ budget director said at a briefing Thursday that the next five classes at the police academy will be canceled and that the number of law enforcement officers will drop from 33,541 to roughly 29,000.

Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry expressed shock and dismay at the deep cuts to policing, saying that they would wreck decades of progress on public safety.

“This is truly a disaster for every New Yorker who cares about safe streets. Cops are already stretched to our breaking point, and these cuts will return us to staffing levels we haven’t seen since the crime epidemic of the ’80s and ’90s,” Mr. Hendry said in a statement.

“We cannot go back there. We need every level of government to work together to find a way to support police officers and protect New York City’s thirty years of public safety progress,” he added.

The Department of Sanitation is facing a $5.5 million cut, leading to fewer sidewalk trash bins and less street cleaning.

The United Federation of Teachers said that around 43 percent of the school system—or 653 schools—would face budget cuts.

“I’ve never seen a mayor saying we’re doing cuts when the revenue is up. We’re past the revenue projections, taxes are coming in, they’re making a fortune off of speed cameras,” Michael Mulgrew, president of the teachers union, told CBS in an interview. “I’ve never seen this situation, ever, in my entire time in this job.”

The cuts come as roughly 143,000 illegal immigrants have come to New York City since the spring of 2022, with over 65,000 still in the city’s shelters.

State authorities in Texas and other parts of the country most acutely suffering the burden of illegal border-crossers have been sending them to sanctuary cities such as New York.

Mr. Adams has been warning for months about the need for painful cuts due to the illegal immigration crisis, while publicly blaming President Joe Biden for not offering enough federal help.

Republicans have blamed President Biden for the border crisis, arguing that his “open borders” policies were encouraging people to enter the country illegally, regardless of public statements made by members of his administration that people should only use legal means to come to America.

Nov 16 2023,El Paso law enforcement reacts to immigration enforcement bill heading to governor's desk,ABC 7 KVIA,center,https://kvia.com/news/2023/11/16/el-paso-law-enforcement-reacts-to-immigration-enforcement-bill-heading-to-governors-desk,"EL PASO, Texas (KVIA) -- El Paso County Sheriff Richard Wiles held a press conference Thursday morning to speak on Texas Senate Bill 4. Once signed, that legislation would give state and local law enforcement the authority to arrest migrants who have crossed into the country illegally.

It would also make illegally entering Texas from another country a state crime. It would also give state judges to the authority to order a person to return to the country they entered from.

The bill passed through the Texas House of Representatives on Tuesday, and will head to Governor Greg Abbott's desk this week. Abbott is expected to sign the bill into law.

Sheriff Wiles stated during his press conference that he does not expect his deputies and staff to be heavily impacted if and when the bill is signed by Governor Abbott.

""I don't see a change in the way we do business, the way our patrol officers do business when they encounter undocumented immigrants,"" Wiles said.

The biggest impact Wiles expects to see is on the county jail, since arrested migrants that face state charges will be booked into the county facility."

Oct 07 2023,How Biden’s Promises to Reverse Trump’s Immigration Policies Crumbled,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/06/us/politics/biden-trump-immigration.html,"Immigration was dead simple when Joseph R. Biden Jr. was campaigning for president: It was an easy way to attack Donald J. Trump as a racist, and it helped to rally Democrats with the promise of a more humane border policy.

Nothing worked better than Mr. Trump’s “big, beautiful wall” that he was building along the southern border. Its existence was as much a metaphor for the polarization inside America as it was a largely ineffective barrier against foreigners fleeing to the United States from Central America.

“There will not be,” Mr. Biden proclaimed as he campaigned against Mr. Trump in the summer of 2020, “another foot of wall constructed.”

But a massive surge of migration in the Western Hemisphere has scrambled the dynamics of an issue that has vexed presidents for decades, and radically reshaped the political pressures on Mr. Biden and his administration. Instead of becoming the president who quickly reversed his predecessor’s policies, Mr. Biden has repeatedly tried to curtail the migration of a record number of people — and the political fallout that has created — by embracing, or at least tolerating, some of Mr. Trump’s anti-immigrant approaches."
Sep 15 2023,Democrats need to admit that they’re wrong on immigration,Fareed Zakaria,center,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/15/immigration-democrats-errors-voters/,"The Democrats are confronting a crisis that could cripple their chances at the polls at the national, state and local level. I’m talking about immigration. It’s happening not only because Republicans are taking advantage of the problem but also because Democrats are unwilling to accept that their policy ideas on the issue are wrong and grossly inadequate to the challenge at hand.

The Biden administration’s various efforts have amounted to Band-Aids on a massive, open wound. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has said repeatedly that the asylum system is broken. But if that’s true, we need a drastic, dramatic overhaul of the system, and neither he nor President Biden is proposing anything like that.

To understand how to think of this issue, let’s go back to basics. After World War II, the United States developed pathways for people who faced extreme persecution because of their race, religion or beliefs to take refuge in America.

Follow this author Fareed Zakaria 's opinions Follow

But there are two realities that are critical to turning this idealistic impulse into a workable system. First, there are surely tens of millions of people around the world who could plausibly claim that they face persecution, and the United States cannot possibly take them all in. More important, the United States cannot be forced to give priority to people who break the law and enter the country illegally — and then claim asylum status to legitimize their entry — as opposed to those who follow the rules, apply from their home countries and wait their turn. But that is what is happening every day at the southern border.

Second, these asylum cases must be special and distinct from the cases of people from all over the world who are trying to immigrate to the United States because they are fleeing poverty, disease or violence. People who fall into this category face a complex and elaborate process that entails several mechanisms for obtaining various kinds of visas and work permits, some of which can eventually translate into a green card and eventually citizenship.

But instead of going through that arduous, lengthy process, many seem to have decided that it would be simpler to pay cartels to help them cross the border illegally, present themselves as asylum seekers, and slip into the country while their cases are being adjudicated. In a 17-month period between March 2021 and August 2022, the federal government released more than 1 million migrants into the United States and lost track of over 177,000 of them who had failed to give an address or had provided an invalid one. When the system of due process collapses, as it has, it is most unfair to those who have legitimate claims to asylum or legal immigrant status.

There is only one solution to this crisis, as Nolan Rappaport, a longtime congressional expert on the issue, has suggested: The president must use the power he has in existing law to suspend entirely the admission of asylum seekers while the system digests the millions of immigration cases already pending. The British government has passed a law to this effect.

Other Western countries will undoubtedly follow. The world has changed. There are more than 40 million refugees and asylum seekers globally. We need new laws, standards, courts and systems so that asylum can be granted through some orderly, rational process — rather than just leaving it up to officials in countries that are overwhelmed by illegal entrants at their borders.

The migrant crisis is exposing Democratic policy weakness at every level, from an administration that is scared to take on its progressive wing and take bold action to states such as New York and Massachusetts, which have “right to shelter” rules that are utterly unworkable in the face of this onslaught. Unless Democrats seize control of the issue, the politics of it will end up having the same effect as in other Western countries — rocket fuel for the populist right."

Sep 28 2023,Elon Musk Visits Illegal Immigration Hotspot At Southern Border,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/28/elon-musk-visits-illegal-immigration-hotspot-at-southern-border,"Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk visited the U.S.-Mexico border near Eagle Pass, Texas Thursday, according to video shot by a Daily Caller News Foundation reporter.

DCNF investigative reporter Jennie Taer shot video of Musk’s arrival and posted it on Twitter Thursday. Musk arrived in the area amid a surge of border crossings by illegal immigrants this month, including a group of over 2,000 at Eagle Pass on Sept. 18 that was caught on video.

Musk also posted a four-minute video on Twitter showing the situation at the border Thursday, saying “I’m at Eagle Pass, I just arrived, and we’re just going to go around and talk to the major officials and law enforcement and what not that are here and just kinda eyeball the situation and get a sense about what’s going on.”

“This is real-time, unfiltered, there’s no preconditions, no nothing,” Musk, who was accompanied by Republican Rep. Tony Gonzalez of Texas, added. “What you see is what I see.”

Musk uploaded a second video to Twitter, where Gonzalez guided him where they saw a group of illegal immigrants being processed by United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

Over 1.6 million illegal immigrants have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during fiscal year 2023, according to data released by CBP, following 2.2 million encounters in fiscal year 2022 and 1.6 million in fiscal year 2021, while Fox News reported another 600,000 migrants evaded CBP in fiscal year 2022.

“Let me preface this by also saying that as an immigrant to the United States, I am extremely pro-immigrant, and I believe that we need a greatly expanded legal immigration system and we should let anyone in the country who is hard-working and honest and who will be a contributor to the United States,” Musk said. “We should have expedited legal approval for anyone who falls into that category.”

“But then, by the same token, we should not be allowing people into the country that are breaking the law,” Musk continued.

Taer posted a second video showing more illegal immigrants entering the United States during Musk’s visit.

Sep 28 2023,"Fact-checking the Republican candidates’ debate on immigration, crime, economy",The Dallas Morning News,center,https://dallasnews.com/news/politifact/2023/09/28/fact-checking-the-republican-candidates-debate-on-immigration-crime-economy,"The second Republican presidential primary debate had a raucous tone, with the seven candidates frequently talking over one another and the moderators calling for order. But themes quickly emerged, including the auto workers’ strike, crime, government spending, inflation and border security.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the polls, skipped the debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Participating candidates included North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.

Immigration

Mike Pence: “Despite what’s said here today, we reduced illegal immigration and asylum abuse by 90%.”

Breaking News Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

This is False.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, immigration plunged worldwide as governments enacted policies limiting people’s movement. In the U.S., Trump instituted Title 42, a public health policy authorizing the Border Patrol to immediately return most immigrants back to Mexico.

Advertisement

Before the pandemic, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported only enforcement actions under immigration law; its data during the pandemic includes actions under immigration law and Title 42.

Accounting for challenges in data comparisons, our review found a 300% increase in illegal immigration from February 2017, Trump’s first full month in office, to his last full month, December 2020.

One way to get close to Pence’s purported 90% illegal immigration decrease is by comparing data from May 2019, the month with the highest apprehensions during the administration, with data from April 2020, the month with that year’s lowest enforcement actions. But that’s a severely cherry-picked period.

Tim Scott: The southwest U.S. border under President Joe Biden is “unsafe, wide-open and insecure, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans in the last 12 months because of fentanyl.”

Advertisement

Scott’s claim is misleading. Deaths from fentanyl jumped 23% in Biden’s first year in office to more than 70,000. But they have been increasing since 2014 and also rose during Trump’s administration.

Although immigration encounters at the southern U.S. border have spiked under Biden’s watch, experts say most of the fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico is coming through legal ports of entry. The vast majority of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking are U.S. citizens, data shows.

Chris Christie: Donald Trump “built 52 miles of wall.”

Advertisement

The Trump administration built 52 miles of new primary border barriers — the first impediment people encounter if they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, that can block access for pedestrians or vehicles — where there were none before.

The administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary border barriers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.

The U.S.-Mexico border stretches for 2,000 miles across four states and a variety of terrain.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “They’re building cartel-financed tunnels underneath that wall. Semi trucks can drive through them.”

Advertisement

It’s accurate that there are cross-border, cartel-financed tunnels, but unlikely that they can accommodate semi trucks.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that cross-border tunnels have been found in California and Arizona and are associated with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. Since 1993, the Justice Department said authorities have found more than 90 tunnels, about 25 of them around San Diego.

Historically, these tunnels have been used primarily to smuggle marijuana and illegal drugs. By federal law, U.S. authorities must fill the U.S. side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered.

On average, U.S. semi trucks are around 8.5 feet wide and 13.5 feet tall. Underground cross-border tunnels tend to be long but not necessarily wide enough to fit the trucks. A tunnel found in 2022 between Tijuana, Mexico, and a warehouse in Otay Mesa, San Diego, had a diameter of 4 feet. Another one found in 2020 measured 5.5 feet tall and about 2 feet wide.

The economy and government spending

Doug Burgum: For electric vehicles, “the batteries come from China.”

In most cases today, this is accurate.

Data from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, shows China produces about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries, compared with 7% to 10% for the United States.

Advertisement

China is also home to 70% and 85%, respectively, of production capacity for two key parts of electric-vehicle batteries: cathodes and anodes.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August 2022, offers tax incentives for U.S. lithium-ion battery production and for the supply chain to produce them.

The U.S. also signed a memorandum of understanding in early 2023 to help build an electric vehicle battery supply chain in Congo and Zambia, countries with rich supplies of cobalt and other key minerals. This would keep these materials from being exported to China for processing, as happens now.

Advertisement

However, establishing a supply chain that’s competitive with China’s could take years, Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a transportation-focused business consulting company, told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle.

Chris Christie: Inflation is “caused by government spending.”

Government spending certainly affects inflation. But it’s not the only factor.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say it spurred inflation. They differ on how much the law affected inflation, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.

Advertisement

However, none of the experts PolitiFact talked to for a previous fact-check, liberal or conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID-19-related labor market disruptions, shifting energy prices and supply chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse.

Mike Pence: “Ron (DeSantis), you talk a really good game about cutting spending, but you’ve increased spending in Florida by 30%.”

We rated a similar claim Half True.

In 2018, the year before DeSantis became governor, Florida’s budget was about $88.7 billion. In 2023, DeSantis signed a $116.5 billion budget. That’s a 31% increase.

Advertisement

But Pence’s remark omits the other side of the ledger.

From 2018 to 2023, Florida tax revenue rose by about the same percentage as the state’s population grew. Pandemic federal aid boosted Florida’s budget, as it did in other states. And the Florida Legislature is required to pass a balanced budget for DeSantis to sign.

Nikki Haley: “Congress has only delivered a budget on time four times in 40 years.”

This is correct.

Advertisement

“In the nearly five decades that the current system for budgeting and spending tax dollars has been in place, Congress has passed all its required appropriations measures on time only four times,” the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group, wrote earlier this year.

Those were in fiscal years 1977, 1989, 1995 and 1997.

Mike Pence: “We brought 12,000 factories back to America during our administration.”

This is accurate, but needs context.

Advertisement

When then-President Donald Trump cited this statistic in his 2020 State of the Union address, CNN’s fact-checking unit called it “correct,” citing the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses data series and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

But the term “factories” includes everything from large to small establishments, and the pattern for total manufacturing employment was not as strong during the Trump-Pence administration as the pattern for manufacturing establishments.

From the start of Trump’s term to the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. manufacturing employment rose by 419,000. By comparison, since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, manufacturing employment has risen by 801,000, almost twice as fast in a shorter period.

Mike Pence: “Wages are not keeping up with inflation.”

Advertisement

It depends on the time frame measured. Pence is on track if you look at the start of Biden’s term to today. A standard measure of worker pay compared with inflation — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and older — shows that weekly wages were $373 in the first quarter of 2021, when Biden took office, and were $365 in the second quarter of 2023. That’s a 2% decline after accounting for inflation.

However, for each of the past four quarters — a yearlong period in which inflation has eased — wages have been rising faster than inflation. From 2022′s second quarter to 2023′s second quarter, weekly wages rose from $359 to $365 after inflation.

Also, inflation-adjusted wages today are just shy of where they were before the coronavirus pandemic, when they were $367 a week.

Vivek Ramaswamy: As president, I will “reduce the federal employee headcount by 75%.”

Advertisement

Legal experts told PolitiFact they are dubious about this plan, saying it would need congressional approval and could not be accomplished by presidential action alone.

Anne Marie Lofaso, a West Virginia University law professor, said Ramaswamy is arguing “that the president can unilaterally repeal a statute that authorizes the establishment of a government agency. That would be a radical revision of presidential power and a likely violation of separation of powers.”

Donald F. Kettl, the former dean of the University of Maryland’s public policy school, said a 2017 analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, rebutted Ramaswamy’s proposal. It concluded that the president “has no statutory authority to reorganize the executive branch, except where acts of Congress delegate authority to make particular changes.”

Tim Scott, to Nikki Haley: “As the U.N. ambassador, you literally put $50,000 on curtains.”

Advertisement

This is misleading. The U.S. State Department under the Obama administration purchased $50,000 curtains for the official residence of the ambassador to the United Nations, The New York Times reported.

In 2016, the State Department moved the ambassador’s official residence out of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan after a Chinese insurance company bought the hotel. The State Department leased a new residence in Manhattan and Haley became its first occupant when Trump named her U.N. ambassador in 2017.

Custom, mechanized curtains costing $52,701 were installed, but the decision to move the residence and buy the curtains was made before Haley’s tenure. In 2018, The New York Times’ published a story tying Haley to the curtains’ purchase, but later issued a correction, saying its earlier story “created an unfair impression about who was responsible for the purchase in question.”

Florida

Ron DeSantis: “We have a 50-year-low in the crime rate” in Florida.

Advertisement

Data for this claim is incomplete. Crime figures are low in Florida, but DeSantis’ statistic comes from a state database containing information from law enforcement agencies that represent only about 57% of the state’s population, a Sept. 20 NBC News report found.

The patchy data is related to Florida’s transition to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The FBI’s crime reporting database doesn’t support DeSantis’ figure either. Only 48 out of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. The numbers appear to be similar for 2022, according to an analysis by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization.

Ron DeSantis: 2.6 million Floridians without health insurance “is a symptom of our overall economic decline.”

Advertisement

When moderator Stuart Varney pressed DeSantis on the relatively high number of Floridians without health insurance — Varney said it’s 2.6 million — DeSantis blamed politicians in Washington, D.C.

But the numbers from DeSantis’ own state Health Department show no correlation between the economy’s condition and the number of Floridians without health insurance. Despite population growth and economic changes, Florida had about 2.6 million uninsured residents from 2018 through 2021, and about 2.4 million in 2022.

In 2022, Florida’s uninsured rate was 11.2%, higher than the 8% national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ron DeSantis: A proposed Florida school standard to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery was a “hoax that was perpetrated by Kamala Harris.”

Advertisement

DeSantis is dodging the facts. The Florida Board of Education set new social studies standards for middle schoolers July 19.

In a section about the duties and trades performed by enslaved people, the state adopted a clarification that said “instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”

Experts on Black history told PolitiFact that such language is factually misleading and offensive.

Transgender claims

Vivek Ramaswamy: “Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder.”

Advertisement

Medical experts disagree. Being transgender and having gender dysphoria — distress that some people may experience when their sex assigned at birth does not align with their gender identity — is not considered a mental health disorder. Historically, the diagnosis has carried the term “disorder,” but experts no longer view it as a pathology and are working to destigmatize the diagnosis.

Previous terms such as “gender identity disorder” and “transexualism” have evolved into “gender incongruence,” a condition the World Health Organization now considers a condition related to sexual health — not mental health. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, contains a diagnosis for “gender dysphoria,” but experts say it remains partly to let insurance companies cover gender-affirming care and let incarcerated people access care.

Mike Pence: Linn-Mar Community Schools in Iowa had a policy where “you could get a gender transition plan without notifying your parents.”

This needs more context. The Iowa school district in 2022 adopted a policy that allowed students to request a “gender support plan.” According to Axios, this plan would outline a student’s preferred name and pronouns as well as which locker rooms or bathroom the student would use, which is a social, rather than a medical, transition.

Advertisement

The student could choose whether the parents were informed, but the plan was not related to medical transition, which, for minors, requires the consent of parental guardians. Schools often don’t inform parents when students signal they are socially transitioning, The Washington Post reported.

Foreign affairs

Ron DeSantis: “I’ll be the first president elected since 1988 (who’s) actually served overseas in a war.”

This is accurate. DeSantis is the only military veteran among the 2024 presidential candidates, and would be the first U.S. president to have served overseas since President George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988.

Advertisement

DeSantis earned his law degree from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy as a lawyer, also known as a Judge Advocate General, or JAG, officer. His military records show he enlisted in 2004 during his second year at Harvard and served from 2005 to 2010.

He was stationed in Iraq with SEAL Team 1 from 2007 to 2008 as a senior legal adviser to Navy Capt. Dane Thorleifson, the commander of the Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “The reality is just because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.”

Ramaswamy disagreed with some of his opponents about aid to Ukraine, arguing the United States should limit its support for the country in its fight against Russia.

Advertisement

His point about political parties is accurate, but it needs context.

Ukraine banned 11 pro-Russian parties — the largest of which occupied 44 out of 450 seats in parliament, according to Radio Free Europe. The party’s leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, Radio Free Europe reported.

Nov 10 2023,US immigration authorities sued after allegedly neglecting New Mexico detention center conditions,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/us-immigration-authorities-sued-allegedly-neglecting-new-mexico-detention-center-conditions,"A new class-action lawsuit alleges that U.S. immigration authorities disregarded signs of unsanitary and unsafe conditions at a detention center in New Mexico to ensure the facility would continue to receive public funding and remain open.

The lawsuit announced Wednesday by a coalition of migrants' rights advocates was filed on behalf of four Venezuelans ranging in age from 26 to 40 who have sought asylum in the U.S. and say they were denied medical care, access to working showers and adequate food at the Torrance County Detention Facility, all while being pressed into cleaning duties, sometimes without compensation.

The detention center in the rural town of Estancia, about 200 miles from the Mexico border, is contracted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to accommodate at least 505 adult male migrants at any time, though actual populations fluctuate.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY'S INSPECTOR GENERAL STANDS BY CALL TO RELOCATE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM NEW MEXICO ICE FACILITY HIT FOR 'EGREGIOUS' CONDITIONS

ICE ACCUSES DHS INSPECTOR GENERAL OF STAGING PHOTOGRAPH IN CRITICAL REPORT ON MIGRANT FACILITY

Advocates have repeatedly alleged in recent years that the facility has inadequate living conditions and there is limited access to legal counsel for asylum-seekers who cycle through. They have urged ICE to end its contract with a private detention operator, while calling on state lawmakers to ban local government contracts for migrant detention.

""The point is that ICE can’t turn a blind eye to conditions in detention facilities,"" said Mark Feldman, senior attorney at the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is among those representing the plaintiffs. ""They maintain congressionally mandated oversight responsibility over conditions wherever immigrants are detained.""

The detention center failed a performance evaluation in 2021, and the lawsuit alleges that ICE scrambled to avoid documentation of a second consecutive failure that might discontinue federal funding by endorsing a ""deeply flawed, lax inspection"" by an independent contractor.

The lawsuit says the agency disregarded contradictory findings by the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General and a contracting officer at ICE that suggested continued unhealthy conditions and staff shortages.

A spokesperson for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that the agency does not comment on litigation. Last year Chief of Staff Jason Houser said ICE would continuously monitor the facility and noted that it stopped using the Etowah County Detention Center in Alabama when expectations there were not met.

CoreCivic, the private operator at Torrance County, said ICE has repeatedly audited the Estancia facility with results that support continued operations.

""We provide a safe, humane and appropriate environment for those entrusted to us and are constantly striving to deliver an even better standard of care,"" spokesperson Ryan Gustin said via email.

As of September about 35,000 migrants were being held in ICE detention facilities across the U.S., while the agency monitors another 195,000 under alternatives to detention as they advance through immigration or removal proceedings, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

The southern border region has struggled to cope with increasing numbers of migrants from South America who move quickly through the Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama before heading north.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Albuquerque, are also represented by the ACLU, Innovation Law Lab and attorneys for Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan."
Oct 06 2023,The arrival of migrants in big cities is forcing Democrats to change their immigration politics,CNN (Online News),left,https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/05/politics/biden-border-wall/index.html,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

CNN —

President Joe Biden says he’s been forced to violate a campaign promise by adding some new construction to Donald Trump’s border wall.

Big city Democratic mayors are angrily demanding more engagement from the Democratic president to help deal with a wave of migrants seeking asylum. One of them – New York Mayor Eric Adams – is in Latin America this week.

Immigration reality is scrambling the normal immigration rhetoric in uncomfortable ways for Democrats, who generally want to appear welcoming but appear to be taking a harder line along with their new positions.

Why is Biden now behind new border wall?

Here’s how CNN White House reporter Priscilla Alvarez explained Biden’s about-face during an appearance on the network Thursday:

Alvarez: This boils down to the administration running up against a deadline. A source that I spoke with this morning said that the 2019 congressionally appropriated funds for a border barrier had to be used by the end of fiscal year 2023.That means the administration had to make a choice – they either use the money or they don’t use it, and they decided they’re going to use it for these border barriers in South Texas.

Read her full report.

How did Biden justify the switch?

He still says border walls don’t work. “The border wall – the money was appropriated for the border wall,” Biden told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. “I tried to get them to reappropriate it, to redirect that money. They didn’t, they wouldn’t. And in the meantime, there’s nothing under the law other than they have to use the money for what it was appropriated. I can’t stop that.”

Where will these barriers go?

Trump likes to claim that he completed a wall along the Mexico border. That’s inaccurate. As CNN’s fact check team has documented, Trump’s efforts to get a wall built mostly ended up rehabbing 373 miles of barrier. They added 52 miles of primary wall.

Regardless, Biden as a candidate said he wouldn’t add to it. Now his administration is targeting high traffic areas around the Rio Grande.

It’s an area, Alvarez notes, where from October to August there were nearly 300,000 encounters between US officials and migrants.

Is this exactly what Trump did when he built border barriers?

Biden, like Trump, will need to waive dozens of federal laws – The Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, among others – in order to build the new barriers. But there are also major differences between Biden’s actions and Trump’s.

Again, from Alvarez: “These are funds appropriated by Congress. Under the Trump administration they also used Pentagon funds. That is not what is happening here. And last month, (the Biden administration) sought public input from the community as they sought plans to put up the barriers.”

Still, this is a violation of Biden’s pledge during the 2020 campaign to build no new border wall and the latest public acknowledgment that US immigration policy is not one of open arms.

What has changed?

At the border, a fresh tide of migrants has overwhelmed authorities this fall. The images include waves of people crossing illegally. Stowaways on the roofs of trains temporarily closed the international railway bridge in Eagle Pass, Texas, last month.

In northern blue states, governors and mayors are getting louder and more urgent in their calls for the White House to do more to stem the tide of migrants coming into the US and being sent north.

“The failure of federal policies is now impacting the people of Chicago in a very dramatic way,” said a frustrated Mayor Brandon Johnson in a news conference this week.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker sent a letter to the White House demanding federal coordination to deal with people crossing the border.

Who is in charge?

The federal government is supposed to oversee border policy instead of the current system where migrants are bused north as a political statement by Republican governors.

Pritzker and Johnson both gave White House officials an earful in a hastily arranged conference call late Sunday, according to CNN’s report.

Adams, who has been voicing agitation at the federal government for months, is on a trip to Mexico, Ecuador and Colombia this week to discourage asylum-seekers from traveling to the US and then New York City.

“We are at capacity,” he has said.

Adams plans to visit the Darien Gap, the undeveloped mountainous region between Colombia and Panama through which many migrants pass after payments to cartels.

CNN reported back in September on the breakdown in the relationship between the White House and New York’s mayor.

Shortly thereafter, the Biden administration did expand a Temporary Protected Status program to nearly 500,000 Venezuelans asylum seekers, giving them much quicker access to work permits.

That blanket move may also have undercut the administration’s attempt to cut down on the influx of migrants when it promised a tough new policy for undocumented border crossers in May.

What does polling suggest?

Gallup tracks Americans’ attitudes toward immigration and their surveys suggest an uptick in the past two years in the portion of people who want decreased immigration to the US to 41%, its highest level since 2014. Those who want immigration to stay at its present level (31%) or increase (26%) combine for a majority. Democrats since the 1990s have been much more open to immigration than Republicans, although Democrats’ support for increased immigration has fallen since 2021 after decades of generally increasing.

At capacity in New York

In New York City, some 120,000 migrants have arrived buses over the past year, many bussed in from southern Republicans like Gov. Greg Abbott in Texas. New York, which has a policy to shelter and feed them, has struggled to find space and funding.

Earlier this month, CNN spent the night in the Roosevelt Hotel, which closed as a commercial enterprise during the pandemic and now is used to temporarily house migrants.

New York officials have said the city will spend $5 billion on the migrant influx this year, straining the city.

Catch-22 on work

Those seeking asylum from violence in places like Venezuela or Haiti have to wait 150 days inside the country before they can apply for a temporary work permit. Obtaining a job earlier could jeopardize their asylum status. Proposals for a state-level work permits, like one called for by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, have been rejected at the federal level. It creates a system where the migrants, if they ultimately want to stay and work, cannot work when they first get here.

Biden’s move to allow Venezuelans access to work permits was meant to address these concerns.

Why not just change the work rules?

That could require updating immigration laws. Even if the House of Representatives was not currently paralyzed by its lack of a speaker, lawmakers have made little progress in decades of trying to update immigration laws.

Plus, the judicial system devoted to processing the cases of migrants is already backlogged, which means everything takes more time.

A dangerous trek

A CNN team back in April filed an incredible report on what the journey through the Darien Gap is like, interviewing people about why they were fleeing their homes and following them as they risked their lives to pass through the muddy and dangerous region.

More recently, CNN talked to migrants at the southern border of Mexico as they prepared to travel north toward the United States.

“Stories abound from the people here, most originally from Venezuela, of why they left their homes and what they’ve gone through so far on their journeys to Ciudad Hidalgo,” wrote CNN’s David Culver. “The adults sometimes become emotional but more shocking is the calm, matter-of-fact, narration from the children.” Read his report.

That is another debate for attention in the US – how to encourage stability in Central and South American countries, Venezuela in particular, from which so many migrants are embarking on this journey and seeking something better in the US."

The nearly 500-page bill — introduced by lead sponsors Reps. María Elvira Salazar, a Republican from Miami, and Veronica Escobar, a Democrat who represents a district along the border in Texas — is the most detailed and wide-ranging bid during the current Congress to reform U.S. immigration laws, which have not been updated in any significant way since the 1990s.

""The only way our country is going to adequately meet the challenges before us is this way, in a bipartisan manner, with true compromise. Because waiting for either side's idea of what is perfect is exactly what's gotten us into the situation we face today,"" Escobar, who represents El Paso, told reporters Tuesday.

Like other previous comprehensive immigration bills, however, the proposal faces steep odds in a deeply divided Congress, in part due to widespread opposition among Republicans in the House to legalize unauthorized immigrants without first enacting tougher policies to deter migrant arrivals along the U.S.-Mexico border, such as sweeping restrictions on asylum.

The new proposal, called the Dignity Act of 2023, attempts to address concerns raised by Republicans and moderate Democrats about illegal border crossings, which have hit record levels during the Biden administration amid mass migration and displacement in Latin America and the Caribbean.

If enacted, the bill would increase funding for Customs and Border Protection so the agency can hire additional employees, construct barriers in some sectors of the southern border and improve technology to better curtail human and illicit drug smuggling, according to a summary.

The measure would also seek to reduce releases of migrants with court dates, a practice Republicans deride as ""catch and release."" Instead of being released, migrants would be held in processing centers until asylum officers determine whether they should be deported or allowed to stay because they have credible claims. Additional funding would be allocated to hire asylum officers and create loans for lawyers to assist migrants.

To discourage overland journeys to the U.S. border, the bill would fund centers in Latin America where would-be migrants could be screened for eligibility to come to the U.S. with the government's permission, either because they pass initial asylum screenings or qualify for work visas. The Biden administration announced earlier this spring it would set up similar centers, starting in Colombia and Guatemala.

Salazar and Escobar's proposal would also create a massive, multi-step program to allow immigrants already living in the U.S. unlawfully to apply for legal status and, in some cases, American citizenship.

Unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, colloquially known as ""Dreamers,"" would be allowed to apply for permanent residency and ultimately citizenship through a version of the Dream Act proposal that has been floated in Congress since 2001.

Other unauthorized immigrants would have the option to apply for a temporary legal status that could be renewed over a 7-year period. It would allow them to work and live in the U.S. legally, and to travel abroad, if they pass background checks and pay taxes and a $5,000 fee over the course of the program.

Those who successfully complete the 7-year program would then be eligible to apply for permanent legal status. After another five years, they could apply for citizenship. Those who enlist in the military could qualify for an expedited path to citizenship.

A separate program would give farm and agricultural workers living in the U.S. illegally a chance to request temporary legal status and, if they plan to stay in the country long-term, permanent residency.

""For those skeptics, many of them in my Republican Party, that say we are legitimatizing millions without the border being secure, as it has happened for 30 years, listen to this: there's a provision within the Dignity Act that guarantees that no one will become an American until the Government Accountability Office certifies that the border is secure,"" Salazar said Tuesday.

A significant expansion of legal immigration is also a key component of the bill.

The bill would raise the decades-old per-country caps on immigrant visas for would-be immigrants who have family members or employers in the U.S. willing to sponsor them to come to the country as permanent residents.

Under the proposal, the H-2B program for temporary nonagricultural workers would stop counting recent returning workers against the 66,000 yearly cap, so more visas could be issued. It would also expand the H-2A program for farm and agricultural workers by allowing employers to hire workers for year-round sectors, like dairy farms, and opening the program to additional industries, such as forestry and seafood processing.

The bill would create a new visa for those looking to come to the U.S. temporarily to visit family members, and allow foreign students to apply for a permanent immigration program, while staying on their temporary visa, if they choose to.

Those proposals would be paired with provisions designed to increase compliance with U.S. immigration laws, including by phasing in a mandate for businesses to use the E-Verify system to ensure they are only hiring workers with legal status. It would also enhance visa screenings."

Oct 03 2023,Pressure mounts between Biden and Pritzker as Chicago illegal immigration surge nears,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/biden-jb-pritzker-chicago-illegal-immigration,"

Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson may be souring on President Joe Biden as illegal immigrants continue to enter the city of Chicago and the White House provides little help.

In a Sunday evening phone call, which was confirmed by the White House, the Illinois leader pressed White House officials on plans to aid the state, specifically the city of Chicago, as the influx of illegal immigrants strains resources. According to CNN, the call featured Pritzker and Johnson demanding assistance from the federal government to address the increasing number of immigrants arriving in the city, especially as leaders expect Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) to increase the number of immigrants being bused to cities across the country.

EPA STATE GRANTS COULD FUND GREEN POLICIES DEMOCRATS COULDN’T GET AT FEDERAL LEVEL

A falling out with Pritzker could be a particularly brutal hit for Biden’s reelection campaign, as the top Democratic governor is both a surrogate for him and a member of the campaign’s national advisory board.

The number of illegal immigrants who have arrived in the city in the past year or so lies around 15,000. This, plus any additional immigrants sent by border states such as Texas, poses a concern as Chicago braces for winter.

White House officials on the call, intergovernmental affairs director Tom Perez and chief of staff Jeff Zients, urged the city to implement programs similar to those in New York City, such as working to help illegal immigrants get work permits. This wasn’t particularly welcome advice for the leaders, considering the pleas New York’s politicians have made for federal help.

Further, Pritzker reportedly wrote a letter to Biden on Monday demanding that the president respond to the problem of illegal immigration at the southern border. He asked that Biden take the lead on ushering in a coordinated response at the border.

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said, “President Biden has repeatedly called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform since his first day in office.”

“Without the help of Congress, the Administration has been taking action: since May 12, we have removed or returned over a quarter million individuals. We have moved to accelerate the processing of work permits – working to decrease the median processing time from many from 90 to 30 days. We have sent more than 1.4 million emails and text messages to migrants that are eligible to work, reminding them to apply for work permits. And we have provided communities across the country who are supporting recently arrived migrants with all of the $1 billion in grant funding that Congress appropriated.”

“We will continue to work closely with Illinois and states and cities across the country,” they added.

The Biden administration contradicted reports of the phone call with the Illinois Democrats, indicating that the call was productive and part of ongoing discussions of the immigration issue. Further, the White House pointed to the more than $46 million in grant funding Chicago and Illinois have received to address the influx of immigrants.

Abbott has been busing illegal immigrants to cities across the United States, which advertise themselves as sanctuaries for those who are illegally in the country, since 2022.

The surge of illegal immigrants in New York City and the lack of federal help from Biden has driven a wedge between the White House and Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul (D-NY). Both leaders have pleaded with the administration to help with the problem. Adams is reportedly not on speaking terms with the president due to his inaction, while Hochul appears to be civil with Biden.

A similar fate is possible for Biden’s relationships with Pritzker and Johnson if he ignores their calls for help. The emerging fractures among prominent Democrats could further spell bad news for Biden in what already promises to be a close election in 2024.

Pritzker did not provide comment to the Washington Examiner."

Daily Caller News Foundation

Billionaire businessman Elon Musk said he’ll visit the southern border after talking to a GOP congressman about the severity of the immigration crisis, in a tweet posted Tuesday.

Musk said he will visit Eagle Pass, Texas, “later this week to see what’s going on for myself” after he spoke with Republican Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales. The area has seen thousands of migrants cross illegally in recent days, leading the mayor of Eagle Pass to declare a state of emergency.

TRENDING: Greatest Show on Earth: The Hur report hearing

“The city of Eagle Pass is committed to the safety and well being of local citizens. The emergency declaration grants us the ability to request financial resources to provide the additional services caused by the influx of the undocumented immigrants,” Democratic Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas said in a Sept.19 statement.

Border Patrol recorded more than 1.8 million illegal crossings at the southern border between October 2022 and July, according to federal data. In fiscal year 2022, the number of illegal crossings hit a record 2.2 million. In August alone, Border Patrol recorded more than 181,000 illegal crossings in the region.

Additionally, Border Patrol arrested 151 illegal migrants whose names appeared on the national terrorism watchlist between October 2022 and August, according to federal data updated Friday.

Other areas of the southern border, such as San Diego and El Paso, are also seeing surges in illegal immigration in recent days. El Paso Mayor Oscar Leeser said Saturday that the city is at its “breaking point.”

Sep 07 2023,Federal judge deflates Abbott’s anti-immigration buoy barriers,MSNBC,left,https://msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/greg-abbott-texas-border-rio-grande-barrier-rcna103899,"UPDATE (Sept. 8, 2023, 7:07 a.m. ET): A federal appeals court on Thursday put a hold on a judge's order requiring Texas officials to remove a floating barrier in the Rio Grande. The temporary pause will remain in place as the appeals court considers a longer stay.

A federal judge has ordered that a floating barrier placed by Texas officials in the Rio Grande to deter migrants from seeking harbor in the United States must be moved as courts consider its legality.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has ushered in a raft of anti-immigration measures under a widely criticized initiative known as Operation Lone Star. One of them — tossing a 1,000-foot blockade of buoys with razor wire into the Rio Grande — broke federal law, U.S. District Judge David Ezra ruled Wednesday. The Biden administration has sued to have the barrier removed under the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899, which requires states to seek federal permission for such projects.

In one footnote, Ezra dropped a truth bomb on the Abbott administration and the entire conservative movement over their obsession with erecting border barriers.

Ezra agreed that Texas needed to to seek permission first, and he ordered the barrier to be moved out of the water as the lawsuit is litigated in court.

“Governor Abbott announced that he was not ‘asking for permission’ for Operation Lone Star, the anti-immigration program under which Texas constructed the floating barrier,” Ezra wrote, referring to a tweet of Abbott’s from March. “Unfortunately for Texas, permission is exactly what federal law requires before installing obstructions in the nation’s navigable waters.”

In one footnote, Ezra dropped a truth bomb on the Abbott administration and the entire conservative movement over their obsession with erecting border barriers. The judge wrote:

This Court is sympathetic with the aim of curtailing illegal immigration and illegal importation of drugs. However, the vast majority of illegal drugs which enter Texas, and indeed the United States in general, come through ports of entry by using covert means and not through this stretch of the Rio Grande River.

Texas officials have used extremist rhetoric to portray migrants approaching the U.S. border as part of an “invasion” to constitutionally justify taking violent, cruel and, fundamentally, unilateral actions. Ezra dispensed with that argument, writing that Texas’ “self defense argument is unconvincing” and that the state’s claim of being invaded “is a non-justiciable political question demonstrably committed to the federal political branches.”

Abbott immediately vowed to appeal, but the fiasco is the latest sign that his Operation Lone Star effort is taking on water. The Justice Department has already opened a civil rights investigation into the operation, Texas National Guard members have complained about poor working conditions and pay, multiple soldiers linked to the mission are suspected to have died by suicide, and now the buoy blockade has been beached."

Vance (R-OH) sparked a social media debate this week when he claimed illegal immigration drives up the cost of housing.

After an economics professor attempted to correct Vance on Twitter, sharing a graph that suggested rent had risen independent of immigration levels, Vance responded by calling the professor one of the “left wing ideologues” in academia and insulting his IQ.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN FRUSTRATION WITH FBI DIRECTOR WRAY REACHING BOILING POINT

Senator, I have put together the chart showing the two variables you were trying to link. https://t.co/edC45zOqoK pic.twitter.com/IFVDvPRQAU — Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) May 22, 2023

Vance highlighted several flaws in the professor’s argument, which had many defenders on social media.

An obvious issue here is that the green line is cumulative and the yellow is annualized. People rightly point out that college professors are left wing ideologues. A bigger issue with people like Wolfers is that he has an IQ of 110 but thinks it’s 140. https://t.co/bJXy2UOMPb — J.D. Vance (@JDVance1) May 22, 2023

Among them was the likelihood that the professor used only legal immigration figures in his analysis, while the problem Vance described had much more to do with the historic levels of illegal immigration.

Immigration does indeed strain housing markets, multiple studies have found.

The pandemic compounded that pressure by slowing construction on new homes and disrupting the supply chains that builders use to obtain materials.

It’s an issue Vance has addressed previously in his young Senate career.

“If you think about what it means to have 20 [million] or 25 million undocumented, illegal immigrants in a country, in a situation where we’re not building enough housing, that puts incredible pressure — you have way more buyers for way fewer homes,” Vance said in February during a Senate Banking Committee hearing.

The slowdown in residential construction has crunched the housing supply at a time when a record number of asylum-seekers are pouring over the border.

With a shortage of houses on the market and a growing number of people opting to stay put in homes they financed at far lower interest rates, the cost of existing houses has climbed dramatically.

But the increase in home values is not evenly distributed across the country.

In San Francisco, for example, home values have dropped “faster than almost anywhere else in the country,” data from mortgage analytics firm Black Knight shows, as demand to live in the area evaporates. Seattle also showed a significant drop in the price of a home.

Several factors have driven people from those cities, such as crime and high taxes. In some of the places where they’ve chosen to move, however, they have discovered that growing populations of undocumented immigrants are competing for the limited housing available.

The problem is not evenly distributed among income groups, either.

Immigration affects blue-collar people more dramatically than higher-income people, according to a 2007 paper published in the Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration.

“The individuals who lose more from immigration are less educated native workers who rent their house,” the paper’s authors wrote.

The negative effects on renters are more pronounced in part because rising housing costs don’t benefit them, while a homeowner sees his or her investment grow when home values rise.

And the most recent pattern of immigration — the arrival of more than 2 million people at the border in the last fiscal year alone, most of them with low education and few professional skills — means the increase in demand for housing is concentrated heavily in the market for lower-cost rentals.

For the cost of rent in cities, immigration causes “an economic impact that is an order of magnitude bigger than that found in labor markets,” economist Albert Saiz wrote in a 2007 paper published in the Journal of Urban Economics.

Legal immigration caused rents to rise in the cities where immigrants settled, Saiz found, even when the arrival of those immigrants did not similarly affect wages.

A 2017 analysis by the Urban Institute found that while inflows of immigrants caused a significant increase in home prices and rents in big cities, the areas surrounding those cities experienced even more cost inflation.

As people moved out of urban neighborhoods that immigrants started to take over, their exodus to the suburbs drove up the price of housing there as well, the analysis found.

Texas has experienced some of the largest increases in home values, in at least some part because of its growing population of undocumented immigrants.

Housing affordability dropped more sharply in six of the largest Texas cities than it did nationally or in notoriously unaffordable San Francisco and New York City in the past several years, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found last month.

Immigration-related population growth has combined with an influx of people relocating from other states to create a high-demand situation that builders, facing rising costs themselves, have not managed to satisfy.

Thousands of asylum-seekers are presently under the temporary care of local governments in New York City and other big cities, where officials have tried everything from using taxpayer money for hotel stays to converting school gymnasiums to temporary shelters.

Some undocumented immigrants will disperse to other parts of the country in the months ahead, relieving pressure on the cities.

Ultimately, however, many of those immigrants will go on to compete with lower-income people in cities for both affordable housing options and space in public housing."
Sep 28 2023,"Fact-checking the second Republican debate: Candidates spar on immigration, crime, economy",Poynter,center,https://poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/second-republican-primary-debate-fact-check,"The second Republican presidential primary debate had a raucous tone, with the seven candidates frequently talking over one another and the moderators calling for order. But themes quickly emerged, including the auto workers’ strike, crime, government spending, inflation and border security.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the polls, skipped the debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Participating candidates included North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.

The candidates leveled accusations about allegiances with foreign governments and increasing spending during one another’s tenures. We fact-checked many of their claims.

Immigration

Mike Pence: “Despite what’s said here today, we reduced illegal immigration and asylum abuse by 90%.”

This is False.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, immigration plunged worldwide as governments enacted policies limiting people’s movement. In the U.S., Trump instituted Title 42, a public health policy authorizing the Border Patrol to immediately return most immigrants back to Mexico.

Before the pandemic, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported only enforcement actions under immigration law; its data during the pandemic includes actions under immigration law and Title 42.

Accounting for challenges in data comparisons, our review found a 300% increase in illegal immigration from February 2017, Trump’s first full month in office, to his last full month, December 2020.

One way to get close to Pence’s purported 90% illegal immigration decrease is by comparing data from May 2019, the month with the highest apprehensions during the administration, with data from April 2020, the month with that year’s lowest enforcement actions. But that’s a severely cherry-picked period.

It’s unclear what Pence means by “asylum abuse.”

However, based on bills Republican members of Congress have introduced to reduce “asylum abuse,” Pence might be referring to asylum seekers who are released into the U.S. to await their court cases and do not show up to their hearings. As PolitiFact has previously reported, most people who are released into the U.S. do attend their hearings.

Tim Scott: The southwest U.S. border under President Joe Biden is “unsafe, wide-open and insecure, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans in the last 12 months because of fentanyl.”

Scott’s claim is misleading. Deaths from fentanyl jumped 23% in Biden’s first year in office to more than 70,000. But they have been increasing since 2014 and also rose during Trump’s administration.

Although immigration encounters at the southern U.S. border have spiked under Biden’s watch, experts say most of the fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico is coming through legal ports of entry. The vast majority of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking are U.S. citizens, data shows.

Chris Christie: Donald Trump “built 52 miles of wall.”

The Trump administration built 52 miles of new primary border barriers — the first impediment people encounter if they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, that can block access for pedestrians or vehicles — where there were none before.

The administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary border barriers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.

The U.S.-Mexico border stretches for 2,000 miles across four states and a variety of terrain.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “They’re building cartel-financed tunnels underneath that wall. Semi trucks can drive through them.”

It’s accurate that there are cross-border, cartel-financed tunnels, but unlikely that they can accommodate semi trucks.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that cross-border tunnels have been found in California and Arizona and are associated with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. Since 1993, the Justice Department said authorities have found more than 90 tunnels, about 25 of them around San Diego.

Historically, these tunnels have been used primarily to smuggle marijuana and illegal drugs. By federal law, U.S. authorities must fill the U.S. side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered.

On average, U.S. semi trucks are around 8.5 feet wide and 13.5 feet tall. Underground cross-border tunnels tend to be long but not necessarily wide enough to fit the trucks. A tunnel found in 2022 between Tijuana, Mexico, and a warehouse in Otay Mesa, San Diego, had a diameter of 4 feet. Another one found in 2020 measured 5.5 feet tall and about 2 feet wide.

The economy and government spending

Doug Burgum: For electric vehicles, “the batteries come from China.”

In most cases today, this is accurate.

Data from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, shows China produces about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries, compared with 7% to 10% for the United States.

China is also home to 70% and 85%, respectively, of production capacity for two key parts of electric-vehicle batteries: cathodes and anodes.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August 2022, offers tax incentives for U.S. lithium-ion battery production and for the supply chain to produce them.

The U.S. also signed a memorandum of understanding in early 2023 to help build an electric vehicle battery supply chain in Congo and Zambia, countries with rich supplies of cobalt and other key minerals. This would keep these materials from being exported to China for processing, as happens now.

However, establishing a supply chain that’s competitive with China’s could take years, Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a transportation-focused business consulting company, told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle.

Chris Christie: Inflation is “caused by government spending.”

Government spending certainly affects inflation. But it’s not the only factor.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say it spurred inflation. They differ on how much the law affected inflation, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.

However, none of the experts PolitiFact talked to for a previous fact-check, liberal or conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID-19-related labor market disruptions, shifting energy prices and supply chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse.

Mike Pence: “Ron (DeSantis), you talk a really good game about cutting spending, but you’ve increased spending in Florida by 30%.”

We rated a similar claim Half True.

In 2018, the year before DeSantis became governor, Florida’s budget was about $88.7 billion. In 2023, DeSantis signed a $116.5 billion budget. That’s a 31% increase.

But Pence’s remark omits the other side of the ledger.

From 2018 to 2023, Florida tax revenue rose by about the same percentage as the state’s population grew. Pandemic federal aid boosted Florida’s budget, as it did in other states. And the Florida Legislature is required to pass a balanced budget for DeSantis to sign.

Nikki Haley: “Congress has only delivered a budget on time four times in 40 years.”

This is correct.

“In the nearly five decades that the current system for budgeting and spending tax dollars has been in place, Congress has passed all its required appropriations measures on time only four times,” the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group, wrote earlier this year.

Those were in fiscal years 1977, 1989, 1995 and 1997.

Mike Pence: “We brought 12,000 factories back to America during our administration.”

This is accurate, but needs context.

When then-President Donald Trump cited this statistic in his 2020 State of the Union address, CNN’s fact-checking unit called it “correct,” citing the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses data series and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

But the term “factories” includes everything from large to small establishments, and the pattern for total manufacturing employment was not as strong during the Trump-Pence administration as the pattern for manufacturing establishments.

From the start of Trump’s term to the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. manufacturing employment rose by 419,000. By comparison, since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, manufacturing employment has risen by 801,000, almost twice as fast in a shorter period.

Mike Pence: “Wages are not keeping up with inflation.”

It depends on the time frame measured. Pence is on track if you look at the start of Biden’s term to today. A standard measure of worker pay compared with inflation — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and older — shows that weekly wages were $373 in the first quarter of 2021, when Biden took office, and were $365 in the second quarter of 2023. That’s a 2% decline after accounting for inflation.

However, for each of the past four quarters — a yearlong period in which inflation has eased — wages have been rising faster than inflation. From 2022’s second quarter to 2023’s second quarter, weekly wages rose from $359 to $365 after inflation.

Also, inflation-adjusted wages today are just shy of where they were before the coronavirus pandemic, when they were $367 a week.

Vivek Ramaswamy: As president, I will “reduce the federal employee headcount by 75%.”

Legal experts told PolitiFact they are dubious about this plan, saying it would need congressional approval and could not be accomplished by presidential action alone.

Anne Marie Lofaso, a West Virginia University law professor, said Ramaswamy is arguing “that the president can unilaterally repeal a statute that authorizes the establishment of a government agency. That would be a radical revision of presidential power and a likely violation of separation of powers.”

Donald F. Kettl, the former dean of the University of Maryland’s public policy school, said a 2017 analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, rebutted Ramaswamy’s proposal. It concluded that the president “has no statutory authority to reorganize the executive branch, except where acts of Congress delegate authority to make particular changes.”

Tim Scott, to Nikki Haley: “As the U.N. ambassador, you literally put $50,000 on curtains.”

This is misleading. The U.S. State Department under the Obama administration purchased $50,000 curtains for the official residence of the ambassador to the United Nations, The New York Times reported.

In 2016, the State Department moved the ambassador’s official residence out of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan after a Chinese insurance company bought the hotel. The State Department leased a new residence in Manhattan and Haley became its first occupant when Trump named her U.N. ambassador in 2017.

Custom, mechanized curtains costing $52,701 were installed, but the decision to move the residence and buy the curtains was made before Haley’s tenure. In 2018, The New York Times’ published a story tying Haley to the curtains’ purchase, but later issued a correction, saying its earlier story “created an unfair impression about who was responsible for the purchase in question.”

Florida

Nikki Haley: “Ron DeSantis is against fracking. He’s against drilling.”

This claim from a contentious moment rates Half True.

Haley said DeSantis “always talks about what happens on Day 1. You better watch out because what happens on Day 2 is when you’re in trouble. Day 2 in Florida, you banned fracking, you banned offshore drilling, you did it on federal lands and you took green subsidies that you didn’t have to take.”

DeSantis interrupted Haley twice: “That’s not true,” he said.

Two days into his first term, DeSantis issued an executive order with several water policy reforms and directed the Department of Environmental Protection to push to end all fracking in Florida.

But as DeSantis noted in the debate, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to ban offshore drilling for oil and natural gas on lands beneath state waters. As a presidential candidate, DeSantis says he will honor Florida’s ban, but is open to fracking elsewhere.

Ron DeSantis: “We have a 50-year-low in the crime rate” in Florida.

Data for this claim is incomplete. Crime figures are low in Florida, but DeSantis’ statistic comes from a state database containing information from law enforcement agencies that represent only about 57% of the state’s population, a Sept. 20 NBC News report found.

The patchy data is related to Florida’s transition to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The FBI’s crime reporting database doesn’t support DeSantis’ figure either. Only 48 out of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. The numbers appear to be similar for 2022, according to an analysis by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization.

Ron DeSantis: 2.6 million Floridians without health insurance “is a symptom of our overall economic decline.”

When moderator Stuart Varney pressed DeSantis on the relatively high number of Floridians without health insurance — Varney said it’s 2.6 million — DeSantis blamed politicians in Washington, D.C.

But the numbers from DeSantis’ own state Health Department show no correlation between the economy’s condition and the number of Floridians without health insurance. Despite population growth and economic changes, Florida had about 2.6 million uninsured residents from 2018 through 2021, and about 2.4 million in 2022.

In 2022, Florida’s uninsured rate was 11.2%, higher than the 8% national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ron DeSantis: A proposed Florida school standard to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery was a “hoax that was perpetrated by Kamala Harris.”

DeSantis is dodging the facts. The Florida Board of Education set new social studies standards for middle schoolers July 19.

In a section about the duties and trades performed by enslaved people, the state adopted a clarification that said “instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”

Experts on Black history told PolitiFact that such language is factually misleading and offensive.

Transgender claims

Vivek Ramaswamy: “Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder.”

Medical experts disagree. Being transgender and having gender dysphoria — distress that some people may experience when their sex assigned at birth does not align with their gender identity — is not considered a mental health disorder. Historically, the diagnosis has carried the term “disorder,” but experts no longer view it as a pathology and are working to destigmatize the diagnosis.

Previous terms such as “gender identity disorder” and “transexualism” have evolved into “gender incongruence,” a condition the World Health Organization now considers a condition related to sexual health — not mental health. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, contains a diagnosis for “gender dysphoria,” but experts say it remains partly to let insurance companies cover gender-affirming care and let incarcerated people access care.

Mike Pence: Linn-Mar Community Schools in Iowa had a policy where “you could get a gender transition plan without notifying your parents.”

This needs more context. The Iowa school district in 2022 adopted a policy that allowed students to request a “gender support plan.” According to Axios, this plan would outline a student’s preferred name and pronouns as well as which locker rooms or bathroom the student would use, which is a social, rather than a medical, transition.

The student could choose whether the parents were informed, but the plan was not related to medical transition, which, for minors, requires the consent of parental guardians. Schools often don’t inform parents when students signal they are socially transitioning, The Washington Post reported.

Foreign affairs

Ron DeSantis: “I’ll be the first president elected since 1988 (who’s) actually served overseas in a war.”

This is accurate. DeSantis is the only military veteran among the 2024 presidential candidates, and would be the first U.S. president to have served overseas since President George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988.

DeSantis earned his law degree from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy as a lawyer, also known as a Judge Advocate General, or JAG, officer. His military records show he enlisted in 2004 during his second year at Harvard and served from 2005 to 2010.

He was stationed in Iraq with SEAL Team 1 from 2007 to 2008 as a senior legal adviser to Navy Capt. Dane Thorleifson, the commander of the Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “The reality is just because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.”

Ramaswamy disagreed with some of his opponents about aid to Ukraine, arguing the United States should limit its support for the country in its fight against Russia.

His point about political parties is accurate, but it needs context.

Ukraine banned 11 pro-Russian parties — the largest of which occupied 44 out of 450 seats in parliament, according to Radio Free Europe. The party’s leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, Radio Free Europe reported.

Jun 23 2023,Supreme Court Reinstates Biden's Immigration Policy,Time Magazine,left,https://time.com/6289872/supreme-court-immigration-biden-policy,"In an 8-1 ruling Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the federal government’s immigration enforcement guidelines dictating which unauthorized immigrants should be prioritized for arrest and deportation. The court decided that Texas and Louisiana, the states that challenged federal guidelines, lacked standing to bring the suit.

The suit, United States v. Texas, centered around a 2021 memo from the Biden administration that instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to prioritize arrests of immigrants who had serious criminal records, were threats to national security, or had recently entered the country illegally. The policy diverted from former President Donald Trump’s hardline approach, encouraging arrests of anyone who was in the U.S. without authorization. Biden’s policy generally avoids arresting immigrants who’ve been residing in the U.S. for years without committing serious crimes.

Republican leaders in Texas and Louisiana challenged the policy in federal court last summer arguing that it limited ICE agents from fully enforcing immigration laws. Once lower court judges blocked the federal policy, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.

The ruling is a victory for the Biden administration and the White House has reiterated its priority to be intentional about who is detained and deported, given limited and strained government resources.

Here’s what to know about the case.

Policy disputes

Roughly 11 million people are in the U.S. without authorization, compared to about 6,000 ICE deportation agents. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called Biden’s shift to target arrests on limited groups to save resources, an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

However, Republican politicians have persistently argued that Biden’s border security and immigration enforcement is too lax, contributing to increases in illegal entry to the U.S. and crime.

U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton, appointed by Trump, blocked the policy in June 2022, calling it unlawful. Unlike the recent Supreme Court ruling, Tipton deemed that Texas had standing because the state was able to prove it had unauthorized immigrants, who in some cases, had committed crimes.

The Supreme Court reviewed the case previously in July 2022, rejecting the White House’s request to immediately restore the federal policy, but agreed to hear the government’s appeal.

The ruling

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the U.S. v. Texas opinion for the majority, upheld by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Kentanji Brown Jackson.

“In sum, the states have brought an extraordinarily unusual lawsuit,” Kavanaugh wrote. “They want a federal court to order the Executive Branch to alter its arrest policies so as to make more arrests. Federal courts have not traditionally entertained that kind of lawsuit; indeed, the States cite no precedent for a lawsuit like this.”

Kavanaugh added that the court was “not the proper forum” for the dispute, but that the states were welcome to pursue recourse through other means, including Congressional oversight and appropriations, or policy changes. If the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of the states, it could’ve set precedent for states to interfere in federal regulation going beyond just immigration, he warned.

Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Amy Coney Barrett concurred, voting with the majority that the states lacked standing, but holding different rationales for why. Justice Samuel Alito was the lone dissenter. Alito rebutted that the majority opinion gave the federal government “sweeping” powers, arguing that states had standing to sue."

Nov 08 2023,"After historic vote, St. Louis Park's Nadia Mohamed shares immigration story that sparked her run for mayor",KSTP,center,https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/after-historic-vote-st-louis-parks-nadia-mohamed-shares-immigration-story-that-sparked-her-run-for-mayor,"After historic vote, St. Louis Park’s Nadia Mohamed shares immigration story that sparked her run for mayor

It was a historic vote in St. Louis Park on Tuesday, with the city electing the state’s first Somali-American mayor, who will also be the city’s first Black mayor.

Nadia Mohamed grew up in St. Louis Park and says she’s filled with pride and honor to be voted in to lead the city.

“I think representation matters because it shows them that there is somebody who has similar lived experience,” the 27-year-old Mohamed said.

It’s not the first time she’s made history. Mohamed became the city’s first Muslim, Somali-American and youngest person to be elected to the city council at just 23 years old.

“Age is nothing but a number,” Mohamed said. “It’s the lived experience that you’re coming in with and it’s the compassion that you have for your community and for your neighbors.”

Mohamed and her family moved from Somalia to the United States when she was 10 years old. Navigating how to thrive in a foreign country was tough.

“I was translating for my mom and my parents, like from a such a young age,” Mohamed explained. “I would navigate this world for her. I would be reading medical documents and important documents and try to figure out, ‘What does this mean?'”

Community resources and services helped alleviate some of the burden. Now, Mohamed wants to pay it forward when she takes the seat as mayor. Some of the issues Mohamed says she’ll prioritize include small businesses, public safety and affordable homeownership.

“I’ve been hearing from voters that homeownership is something that they’re wanting. Even the people who do own their homes, they’re like, ‘I can’t afford to live here right now,'” she said.

Mohamed says being mayor-elect in St. Louis Park is only a milestone and not a destination. She credits loved ones for making it all possible.

“My mother, I got to share her story a little bit last night. I get from her, her ability to get up every day and to say even though I don’t know the language, I don’t know the people and I don’t know anything here, I am going to make a life and I’m going to do this,” Mohamed said.

Mohamed received more than 58% of first-choice votes against retired banker Dale Anderson during Tuesday’s election. She will succeed Jake Spano, who announced in March that he would not seek reelection."
Jul 20 2021,Immigration,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration-3,"Regarding the influx at the border, “The human rights case for ending immigration detention is clear… Yet the economic case is similarly compelling… “A short-lived [alternative to detention program] piloted in the U.S., the Family Case Management Program (FCMP), provided 952 asylum-seeking families with referrals to medical and legal services, English classes and assistance with documentation, among other social supports. In addition to maintaining family unity and treating migrant families humanely, FCMP costs just $38.47 per family, per day, compared to between $237.60 and $318.79 for family detention — all while achieving a 99 percent compliance rate with immigration court requirements… “If we cut what we’re spending on immigration detention by 80 percent and reallocate half of the remaining budget to programs like FCMP , we can ensure the integrity and effectiveness of our immigration system while also respecting migrants’ humanity.” Jody Heymann and Aleta Sprague, The Hill

“A strong majority of eligible voters favor a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants including farmworkers and essential workers. Support for DACA enjoys the support of an even greater majority of eligible voters, even from most Republicans. To the extent that immigration is an issue that Latino voters care about, Latino political scientists have argued that it’s a ‘golden opportunity for Democrats’ because four-fifths of Latino voters support the whole suite of Biden’s immigration proposals… “But following Obama’s own thinking that politics is the art of the possible , Democrats like [Cecilia] Muñoz may be right that, short of including immigration in a budget reconciliation bill, which may or may not be permissible, the best option right now is a proven-to-be-ineffective, Frankenstein-like compromise such as comprehensive immigration reform: a combination of enforcement, naturalization, and adjustments to the number of available visas, in which everybody gets some of what they want, but nobody gets everything.” Geraldo Cadava, Slate

“‘The Democrats want to include a massive amnesty in that legislation,’ [stated] Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). ‘That will simply act as a bigger magnet for more illegal immigration into this country.’ This is nonsense. First and foremost, the population eligible for legalization would likely be restricted to people who’ve already been here for some minimum period of time, rather than those contemplating coming, say, tomorrow. This is how that broader, Biden-backed bill works, and how previous legalization proposals have been structured… “The country needs more immigration pathways that are fair, humane, fast, adequately screened, with clear and consistent eligibility criteria, and deliberately crafted to be in the country’s economic and national security interests. Such an overhaul requires an act of Congress, which has refused to do its duty for decades. ” Catherine Rampell, Washington Post

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-NY) writes, “Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 96 percent of DACA recipients were employed or enrolled in school, slowly but surely entering our workforce pipeline to become our future educators, health care professionals, lawyers, innovators, public servants and community leaders. Nearly 25 percent of recipients also have children who are U.S. citizens, and without swift, decisive action, these families will remain at risk of being torn apart… “We should use every tool in our legislative and parliamentary toolbox to provide a real pathway to citizenship… And that includes using the budget reconciliation process… it is not unprecedented for reconciliation legislation to include immigration reforms, either. In fact, a Republican-controlled Senate did it in 2005 when changes to immigration policy were included as part of a larger budget reconciliation package.” Adriano Espaillat, The Hill

From the Right

The right agrees with the decision striking down DACA, arguing that it is a matter for Congress, and criticizes Biden’s border policies.

The right agrees with the decision striking down DACA, arguing that it is a matter for Congress, and criticizes Biden’s border policies.

“Barack Obama erred in creating the DACA program. The increased politicization of the issue short-circuited any chance that our dysfunctional Congress could come together to solve the problem and poisoned the well for a much-needed compromise on immigration. Although I favor the intent of DACA, I opposed President Obama’s unilateral action and I do believe that President Trump had the authority to end the program…



“Personally, I think that the Supreme Court should hear and uphold today’s ruling, but at the same time, I also believe that the Biden Administration should seek to make DACA permanent by legislative action. This is the way the Founders intended such decisions to be made.”

David Thornton, Racket News

At the same time, “​​There are well-established guardrails for reconciliation, the so-called Byrd rule, to keep it from becoming an end-run around the filibuster for whatever a Senate majority wants to pass. Among other things, the Byrd rule, which is written into statute, says that provisions that don’t have a budgetary impact or merely have an incidental budgetary impact can’t be included in reconciliation…



“This obviously should rule out the kind of amnesty Democrats are talking about, which would cover ‘Dreamers,’ those eligible for Temporary Protected Status, and ‘essential workers.’ Democrats have advocated a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants for decades now, but never have they said that we must create one primarily as a budgetary matter — as if the status of illegal immigrants is a question comparable to the level of Medicare hospital reimbursements or unemployment benefits…



“If the amnesty-via-reconciliation would be a bad process, it would also be terrible on the merits. At least previous so-called comprehensive immigration bills made a show of emphasizing enforcement as the trade-off for an amnesty, whereas Democrats now want only amnesty. It would flash another green light to would-be migrants to come here illegally.”

The Editors, National Review

“Biden has ordered U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ‘to focus on arresting and deporting immigrants assessed to pose a risk to national security; migrants recently apprehended along U.S. borders; and those convicted of certain crimes who have been released from federal, state or local jails.’ Since it will take years for these asylum cases to be settled, and the migrants making these claims will almost all be living far away from the border, unless they commit a major crime, Biden has already promised they can stay forever…



“Migrants in Central America know this. And word is spreading around the world. Illegal immigrant apprehensions on the southern border from countries other than Central America or Mexico have skyrocketed from 7,890 in December to 47,224 this June… the crisis at our southern border is a direct result of his open borders policies.”

Sep 26 2023,Revealed: US immigration agency collects more data on migrants than previously known,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/26/revealed-ice-bi-inc-migrants-more-data-collection,"A US immigration enforcement program that tracks nearly 200,000 migrants is collecting far more data on the people it surveils than officials previously shared, and storing that data for far longer than was previously known, the Guardian can reveal.

Newly released documents show that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (Ice) stores some personal information the program collects on migrants through smartphone apps, ankle monitors and smartwatches for up to 75 years.

A facial recognition app that’s part of the program collects location information whenever someone logs into the app or makes a video call, the documents show, contrary to Ice statements that the app only logs location data when a migrant completes a mandated check-in through the app.

The documents were obtained by immigrants rights groups Just Futures Law, Mijente Support Committee, and Community Justice Exchange through a freedom of information request and a lawsuit.

They reveal that data collection by Ice is more extensive than was previously known to the public and even lawmakers, and raise fresh questions over the lack of transparency from the immigration agency and the company that runs the program, BI Inc.

“We learned there’s really no such thing as data privacy in the context of government mass surveillance,” said Hannah Lucal, a data and tech fellow at Just Futures Law. “The documents convey the alarming scope and scale of Ice’s growing system of data extraction and electronic surveillance monitoring.”

Ice and BI Inc did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

Ice’s ‘unlimited rights to use’ the data

The program in question, the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (Isap), is run on behalf of Ice by BI, which is a subsidiary of the large private prison corporation the Geo Group.

Billed as a humane alternative to keeping people in detention while their case moves through the immigration system, the program keeps track of migrants through ankle monitors, smartwatch trackers, phone check-ins or in-person visits.

But lawmakers and advocates have long demanded more transparency around how BI and Ice run the program, what data they collect through that surveillance system, how long they store that information and how they use it.

The documents show that Ice hasn’t been fully forthcoming in earlier questions about the information it tracks. In 2018, Ice told the Congressional Research Service that it monitored the location of program participants wearing an ankle monitor, but that it did not “actively monitor” the location of those being tracked through the program’s facial-recognition app, SmartLink. The agency said it only collected GPS data on those people during check-ins, when they are required to submit pictures of themselves from several angles to verify their identity and location.

However, an agreement migrants are required to sign when they are assigned SmartLink surveillance, made public as part of the document release, shows that location information is tracked much more frequently, including when users log into the app, start a video call through the app and enroll in it. Ice requires migrants to use the app far more frequently than for weekly check-ins. Olivia Scott, a former BI caseworker, said caseworkers were often asked by Ice to nudge migrants to log into the app, track the location and share that information with an Ice agent.

“They didn’t care what we said to the people [to get them to open the app],” Scott said. “They just needed a location.”

The documents also confirm that Ice ultimately owns the information BI collects on migrants through the program – information that, taken together, can paint a very detailed picture of someone’s life. The data collected through both the app and devices like ankle monitors include real time location history including common routes a person took, personal information such as addresses and employers, education information, financial information, religious affiliation, race and gender. The company also collects and stores a wide swath of biometric information, including images of people’s faces; voice recordings; weight and height; scars and tattoos; and medical information such as disabilities or pregnancies.

Ice is given “unlimited rights to use, dispose of, or disclose” the data that BI shares with it, the documents show – language that, according to privacy advocates, indicates that the agency can share this information with other agencies, including local law enforcement.

The management of that data is also regulated by Ice policies. According to a privacy assessment by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which encompasses Ice, all data collected through the program is stored in a DHS database that requires records be destroyed 75 years after they are first entered. BI keeps the data for seven years after a person is released from the program.

The information BI and Ice collect and store and what the two entities do with it can have far-reaching consequences for migrants, according to the records. For example, the documents show the data BI collects has helped Ice in arresting and detaining migrants. In one of the documents, BI says it “relayed participant GPS points” to Ice’s enforcement arm, which resulted in the “swift and discrete” arrest of more than 40 migrants.

The documents also show Ice’s enforcement arm (ERO) uses an opaque algorithmic scoring system to determine how much of a flight risk a person in the program is. The documents reveal the score – dubbed a “hurricane score” – is based on “risks factors”, though it doesn’t explain what those risk factors are, and BI employees’ weekly assessment of participants’ compliance with the program. If a person is determined by the algorithm to be more likely to abscond, it could lead Ice and BI to impose stricter levels of surveillance.

Maru Mora-Villalpando, a community organizer at immigrant advocacy group La Resistencia, who has worked directly with people in the program, said the revelations about the “amount of access” BI has to people’s personal information “and the unlimited control [BI and Ice] have over all the data” is “appalling”.

“We are a business to them,” she said.

“[The revelations] only make our case stronger for the end to the false idea that digital detention and monitoring of immigrants is an alternative to detention”, Mora-Villalpando said."
Oct 05 2023,Biden Waiving Environmental Laws to Build New Border Wall Signals Shift on Immigration Policy,Mediaite,left,https://mediaite.com/news/biden-waiving-environmental-laws-to-build-new-border-wall-signals-shift-on-immigration-policy,"The Biden administration has reportedly approved the construction of new barricades to stem the flow of illegal immigration, representing a significant shift in border policy and the need for a wall on the U.S. southern border.

The Associated Press reported that the Biden administration waived 26 federal laws in South Texas to permit a border wall construction in Starr County. Authorities have acknowledged the “high illegal entry” levels in the area, and the waivers will reportedly allow the construction to get underway without being hindered by reviews or lawsuits involving environmental laws.

“According to government data, about 245,000 illegal entries have been recorded so far this fiscal year in the Rio Grande Valley Sector, which contains 21 counties,” the AP reported. They also included a statement DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas gave to the U.S. Federal Registry, which said: “There is presently an acute and immediate need to construct physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the border of the United States in order to prevent unlawful entries into the United States in the project areas.”

The border wall could reportedly add up to 20 miles to the area’s already existing barricades, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection explained that the costs will be covered by 2019 funding Congress appropriated for such a construction in the Rio Grande Valley. Democrats have long been staunchly opposed to Donald Trump’s signature policy of building a southern border wall, and the plan seems to contradict President Joe Biden’s 2021 proclamation that he wouldn’t continue it because “Building a massive wall that spans the entire southern border is not a serious policy solution.”

Trump linked to this news which he immediately exploited politically by declaring himself right with his border policies, and to demand an apology from Biden.

“So interesting to watch Crooked Joe Biden break every environmental law in the book to prove that I was right when I built 560 miles (they incorrectly state 450 in story!) of brand new, beautiful border wall,” Trump said. “As I have stated often, over thousands of years, there are only two things that have consistently worked, wheels, and walls! Will Joe Biden appolgize to me and America for taking so long to get moving, and allowing our country to be flooded with 15 million illegals immigrants, from places unknown. I will await his apology!”

Sep 15 2023,Protestors Shout Over Democrats’ Press Conference on NYC’s Illegal Immigration Crisis,NTD,right,https://ntd.com/protestors-shout-over-democrats-press-conference-on-nycs-illegal-immigration-crisis_942279.html,"Several House Democrats were met with protests in New York City on Friday as they held a press conference to discuss the strain that sheltering illegal immigrants and asylum applicants has put on the city’s resources.

Around a dozen House Democrats, including several who represent New York City, toured Manhattan’s Roosevelt Hotel on Friday to see firsthand how the building is now being used to shelter migrants arriving in the city.

As the visiting Democratic delegation held a press conference outside the converted hotel, they were thronged by a crowd of protesters who often drowned them out with calls to secure the U.S. border and restrict new immigration.

New York City has become a receiving point for tens of thousands of non-citizens waiting on federal immigration authorities to decide whether they can remain in the United States or whether they will have to be deported.

Since the spring of 2022, New York City officials have reported taking in more than 110,000 migrants, many of whom may have crossed the border illegally.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), whose district includes parts of the Bronx and Queens, called for new policies to grant work authorization for migrants arriving in the United States.

She and other New York Democrats have argued that allowing these non-citizens to work while they await asylum decisions and removal orders will ease the burden New York City faces to house these people.

“Allow work authorization so folks can get to work and start supporting themselves,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said during the press conference, straining to be heard over the shouting from members of the crowd. “They are prevented from getting jobs. They are prevented from employment, and that is part of the strain on our public system.”

Current U.S. immigration laws prohibit employers from hiring illegal immigrants. Immigration policy (pdf) also prohibits asylum seekers from obtaining work until at least 180 days after submitting their asylum application. Numerous elected Democrats in New York have called for the Biden administration to grant work authorization to illegal immigrants and asylum seekers in the city.

Democrat New York City Mayor Eric Adams has also called on President Joe Biden to declare a temporary protective status (TPS), a federal designation that allows non-citizens from certain countries to remain in the U.S. and find employment without risking deportation.

“The faster that folks can access the work that they are asking for, legally, the better we can solve this problem,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Friday.

Protesters Say ‘Close The Border’

Throughout their press conference on Friday, the Democrats were met with chants of “close the border.”

Among those gathered to shout down the Democratic delegation was Jonathan Rinaldi, a Republican candidate for the New York City Council.

“There’s no money for public housing. There’s no money for our kids. Just look at the streets of our city. This place in the middle of the night is full of people,” Mr. Rinaldi said. “I have kids. I cannot have them walking down the streets anymore.”

Mr. Rinaldi said the solution to New York City’s is to close the U.S. border “immediately.” He said he is in favor of legal immigration, but said the city cannot handle the financial burdens of the current influx of people.

Another protester, David Rem, reiterated the call to “close the border.” He also criticized President Biden’s efforts to end the Migrant Protection Protocols, a Trump-era policy often referred to as the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which required asylum seekers to remain in Mexico until their court date for their asylum case.

Mr. Rem said asylum seekers should continue to be restricted under the “remain in Mexico” policy.

“Have them remain in Mexico like the policy was before,” Mr. Rem said.

Mr. Rem was seen during the protest holding a sign expressing his opposition to Democrats calling for expedited work authorization for the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers in the city.

“No Work Authorization! Remain in Mexico! Cierra La Frontera Ya! Close The Border Now!” his sign read.

Mr. Rem further criticized the current U.S. immigration system, saying he has a family member in Columbia who is pursuing a legal pathway to enter the U.S. that requires them to wait for the time being.

“Why does my family member have to wait in Colombia when they filed a legal petition, and these people are already on 45th street?”

‘We Will Not Be Bullied’: Democrat Lawmaker

Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.) appeared to reference the protesters specifically during his remarks at the Friday press conference.

“As you can see, this is a contentious issue, but we are all Americans and we all believe in the American dream,” Mr. Espaillat said.

The Democrat lawmaker, whose congressional district includes upper Manhattan and parts of the Bronx, said he and his colleagues would not be deterred from pursuing the work authorization for the illegal immigrants and asylum seekers as well as added federal funding to help New York City sustain the continuing influx of people.

“The American dream will not be bullied into submission today,” Mr. Espaillat said over the shouts from the crowd. “We will continue to fight for the American dream. We will not be bullied. We will not be pushed into a corner. We will fight for these common sense solutions.”

Rep. Nicole Maliotakis (R-N.Y.) criticized the solution her Democrat counterparts were asking for, saying relaxed work authorization rules are a “non-starter.”

Ms. Maliotakis, who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, also argued that approving more federal funding for New York City without also doing more to secure U.S. borders would simply exacerbate the flow of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers coming to the city for shelter and assistance.

“I hope @RepAOC & her Democrat colleagues got the message today that New Yorkers are fed up with President Biden’s open border policies that are wreaking havoc in their city,” Ms. Maliotakis said in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday."
Jul 13 2023,Illinois will no longer allow landlords to consider immigration status,Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/us/illinois-will-no-longer-allow-landlords-consider-immigration-status,"An Illinois law set to go into effect at the beginning of 2024 will ban landlords from discriminating against potential tenants on the basis of their immigration status.

Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed SB 1817 into law late last month, which will add ""protections in the Illinois Human Rights Act for housing regarding immigration status protection and discriminatory advertising.""

The law was part of several pieces of legislation Pritzker signed last month, including another law aimed at giving undocumented immigrants access to state drivers licenses. The bill replaces the current Temporary Visitor Driver's License with a standard license that will last four years, a move that will impact over 300,000 people who currently hold the temporary licenses.

SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS LAW BARRING ENCOURAGING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION

""This legislation is a significant step in eliminating the barriers to opportunity that many undocumented immigrants face,"" Pritzker said in a statement after signing the driver's license legislation, according to Fox 32. ""We’re ensuring every eligible individual can obtain a driver’s license, making our roads safer, decreasing stigma, and creating more equitable systems for all.""

The effort to expand housing rights to undocumented immigrants was led by Democratic State Sen. Ann Gillespie, who argued the bill would make sure people are not ""unjustly denied housing.""

""This law sets clear boundaries, protecting the rights of immigrants and ensuring that financial institutions and service providers cannot engage in discriminatory practices,"" Gillespie said in a press release last week.

Gillespie also noted that the bill would prohibit third party loan modification service providers from modifying their terms of service based on immigration status, though inquiries into immigration status will still be allowed where required by law.

""By making this change, we are breaking down barriers and creating opportunities for immigrants to establish homes and contribute to our communities,"" Gillespie said in the release. ""Someone’s background should not disqualify them from buying or renting property."""
Oct 29 2023,"Texas Latino Democrat slams GOP for state bill to detain, remove people suspected of illegal immigration status",NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/texas-latino-democrat-walle-slams-republicans-immigration-bill-detain-rcna122335,"SAN ANTONIO — The Texas House approved a bill that would allow local and state peace officers to detain and remove to Mexico people who they think are here illegally, dismissing pleas from a Latino lawmaker who scolded, ""Y'all don't live in our f---ing skin.""

The bill's passage came early Thursday morning after Republicans truncated debate on the legislation, employing a rarely used procedure to cut off amendments Democrats could propose beyond those that were on the House speaker's desk.

After Democrats failed to undo that restriction, Rep. Armando Walle, D-Houston, lit into Republican members. Several versions of the passionate, expletive-laced video posted on social media show Walle chastising Republicans on the bill and for their refusal to allow for a longer ""civil"" debate that would ""let us blow some steam.""

Rep. Cody Harris, R-Palestine, whom Walle addressed as his friend, sponsored the motion to cut off debate.

""You're my friend, man, I love you, but this f---ing hurts. The s--- that happens on this godd---ed floor hurts. I can't go hang out with my,"" Walle said, swallowing the end of the sentence as he became emotional. ""I can't hang out with my brother, my cousin, OK. I can't take them anywhere, bro? I can't go to a boda (wedding), I can't go to a baptism, because my community is being attacked?""

Reached Thursday afternoon, Walle told NBC News he does not regret his comments. He sees a direct connection between the legislation and the 2024 election season.

“I’ve been in the Legislature 16 years and over time there has been this salacious appetite to feed Republican primary voters by demonizing border issues,” Walle said.

In a statement, Harris defended his motion to limit the number of amendments that Democrats could propose, saying Democrats had filed 50 more amendments as a stalling tactic. He said spikes in numbers of people arriving at the border or crossing illegally has spurred passion on both sides.

""While Democrats argue that this motion was an attempt to shut down debate over the bill, that simply isn’t true. My motion prevailed and we went on to debate the bill and their amendments until 4:00 in the morning when the House passed HB 4,"" Harris said in the statement.

‘Open season on people of color’

Jennefer Canales-Pelaez, Texas policy attorney and strategist for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, said the state deportation bill the House approved is worse than Arizona’s SB 1070 law, signed in 2010, that allowed officers, while enforcing other laws, to investigate the citizenship or immigration status of suspects and people they’ve stopped.

Passage of that law led to court challenges, boycotts, protests and demonstrations and invigorated voter mobilization among Latinos who favored Democrats.

The Texas bill goes further than SB 1070 because it would allow any peace officer to not only question, but arrest and remove them, Canales-Pelaez said. The authority is not only extended to law enforcement, but the broad definition means a peace officer could be “someone who sits on the dental examiners board,"" she said.

“The way that the law is written is just so vague, so essentially it is just open season on people of color throughout the state of Texas,” Canales-Pelaez said.

She said the bill does not address some of the logistics involved in removals, such as what the line of questioning would look like, where it would happen, or what would happen if Mexico does not accept the non-Mexican people Texas tries to remove. Immigration enforcement, including deportation, is a federal responsibility.

The House bill now goes to the state Senate.

Walle's comments were also referring to a bill on its way to the governor that sets a 10-year mandatory minimum penalty for human smuggling and another still to go to the Senate that provided $1.5 billion to buy land and construct a border wall.

""Y'all don't understand the s--- that you do hurts our community. It hurts us personally, bro. It hurts us,"" he said. ""It hurts us to our f---ing core and y'all don't understand that. Y'all don't live in our f---ing skin.""

Hispanics outnumber whites in Texas and the state is majority minority.

Though Walle lives in and was born and raised in Houston, as was his mother, his father is from Mexico. His parents and many other relatives live along the border, he said. The border has its problems, he acknowledged, but ""nobody wants to solve the problems, at least from a state perspective. This has been a big bag of flaming horse manure that people are throwing back and forth, and instead of putting the fire out, the state of Texas wants to put more gas on the fire.""

""But in that process it affects families. It demonizes communities of color like mine,"" he said.

Walle said it was offensive that Republicans cut off debate on future amendments to the immigration bill since under the Legislature's rules anyone can propose an amendment to a bill brought to the floor. Legislation authors should ""stand by their bill,"" he said.

Republicans were able to cut off amendments by obtaining signatures and subjecting the cutoff proposal to a vote. Several members were not in the House when the vote was taken.

""I will never lie down when I feel my community is being attacked. I don't regret what happened last night, period. If I had to do it all over again, I would do it all over again,"" Walle said. ""We are not going to take it anymore.""

The Legislature has approved the bill in the midst of a special session rocked by revelations that the leader of the conservative political action committee Defend Texas Liberty met with white supremacist Nick Fuentes. The PAC gave Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, $3 million in political contributions. House Speaker Dade Phelan, also a Republican, has called for Patrick and several state GOP members who also got money from the PAC to return it, causing a rift in the party.

Lawmakers should have gone home in May, but Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has called them back for three special sessions as he has pushed to get approval for tax money to be used for subsidizing private school tuition. Along with that, he made border and immigration issues an item for the latest special session, which began Oct. 9 and ends Nov. 7.

In 2017, Texas passed its own ""show me your papers"" law that allows law enforcement officers to ask people about their citizenship and immigration status and allowed for those who didn't to be removed from their jobs, including elected officials. It was upheld on appeal."
Sep 12 2023,"Regardless of immigration status, people in Minnesota can begin applying for driver’s licenses",Wisconsin Law Journal,center,https://wislawjournal.com/2023/09/12/regardless-of-immigration-status-people-in-minnesota-can-begin-applying-for-drivers-licenses,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — People living in Minnesota without legal immigration status can now begin the process of getting their driver’s license by making an appointment for their written driver’s test, state officials announced at a news conference Thursday.

Around 81,000 people are expected to be eligible under the state’s new law — dubbed “Driver’s License for All.” They can now make appointments to apply but won’t be able to actually get a license until the law goes into effect Oct. 1.

“We’re incredibly proud to be a part of a handful of states that offer driver’s license for all,” said Pong Xiong, Driver and Vehicle Services Director at the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, at the news conference. “And the first step to getting your driver’s license is to pass that written test.”

The new law removes the requirements for applicants to show legal presence, said Jody-Kay Peterson, the department’s Driver Services Program Director.

When asked about any risk for deportation applicants may face, Peterson said the department will not submit the names or personal information of applicants to any immigration law enforcement.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed the measure into law this year. It reverses a 2003 change by then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a Republican, barring people without legal status from getting licenses, citing security concerns after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Supporters of Minnesota’s new law say it will improve public safety by ensuring that all drivers are licensed and insured, and have taken driver’s education courses. Backers included law enforcement, faith, business and immigrant rights groups.

Opponents say it will encourage illegal immigration.

Applicants must still pass written and road tests and attest to their address in Minnesota. They won’t be asked for proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residency status. But they must provide identifying documents such as an unexpired foreign passport, a consular identification document with a photograph or a certified birth certificate issued by a foreign jurisdiction.

Eighteen other states grant licenses to residents regardless of immigration status, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and the District of Columbia."

Feb 22 2021,Immigration,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration-2,"From the Left

The left is generally supportive of both the bill and Biden’s immigration policies.

“Opponents claim that [a pathway to citizenship] would reward lawlessness and serve as an incentive for a new round of undocumented immigration. As a former federal prosecutor and the head of an organization dedicated to accountability for human rights violations, I find these fears unfounded. A program of broad legalization would be in keeping with the long-established concept of a statute of limitations in criminal law…



“A statute of limitations precludes criminal prosecution after a set period of time. Other than for the most serious federal crimes, U.S. law puts that limit at five years. That limit reflects the practical difficulties of collecting evidence and mounting a defense years after an alleged offense has occurred. It also reflects that it would be unfair to disrupt people’s lives long after they’ve allegedly committed an offense… ‍ “The government is expected to address crimes within a reasonable time or to let things lie. No one seriously claims that this endpoint for criminal liability encourages more crimes. Most deportations of immigrants involve civil rather than criminal proceedings, but similar equitable considerations come into play.”

Kenneth Roth, Los Angeles Times

“The fact is that the undocumented are not going away. They are not going to ‘self-deport,’ as Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) famously suggested when he was running for president in 2012. They perform necessary jobs, they pay all kinds of taxes, they are at least as law-abiding as full-fledged citizens, and they are woven into the fabric of communities from coast to coast. In all but the formal sense, they are Americans. If they were all to somehow disappear tomorrow, the nation would suffer from their absence…



“Rather than nibble at the edges of the problem, Biden calls for a global solution — analogous to the sweeping amnesty President Ronald Reagan engineered in 1986. Whatever you think about the new president and his team, no one can accuse them of thinking small. Republicans are going to ridicule the idea and will likely declare it dead on arrival. But they would subject a more modest proposal to the exact same treatment. Biden is right to start by demanding the reforms the country actually needs, rather than make some sort of tentative opening bid that leaves the situation of most resident noncitizens unaddressed.”

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post

Regarding the new immigration enforcement guidance, “As matters stand, the U.S. government doesn’t have enough immigration judges and attorneys to evaluate asylum claims, and existing Border Patrol stations and other facilities are inadequate for processing applicants during a pandemic. People who are fleeing persecution and violence deserve refuge, but not every border crosser qualifies for asylum. Determining who is eligible takes effort and resources…



“Under Trump, the federal government failed to build up its own capacity to manage migration surges and arbitrate individual cases… The Biden administration needs to buy time, communicating to potential new migrants that the border is still controlled and keeping the CDC order [to expel any border crossers] in place for now. Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is also warning against false rumors that ‘the doors are open’ in the United States. At the same time, the U.S. has to make better preparations for how to handle those who do arrive at the border.”

Jul 25 2023,"Judge rules against Biden immigration policy, calling it 'invalid'",NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-rules-biden-immigration-policy-calling-invalid-rcna96272,"A federal judge in San Francisco dealt a major blow to a signature piece of President Joe Biden’s immigration policy on Tuesday, calling its rule that limits who can apply for asylum at the southern border “both substantively and procedurally invalid.”

Lawyers for the Justice Department immediately responded by issuing a notice to appeal the decision in a higher court, and the case is likely to go all the way to the Supreme Court. The Biden administration is fighting to protect its “asylum ineligibility rule,” which requires asylum-seekers to schedule an appointment for an asylum hearing at a legal port of entry or prove that they had already sought and been denied asylum in another country while en route to the U.S.

Judge Jon Tigar also placed a 14-day stay on his own ruling before it takes effect. The delay may effectively keep the administration's asylum policy in place until the Supreme Court can weigh in.

The Biden administration rule has been in place since Covid-19 restrictions known as Title 42 ended in May. Title 42 had blocked more than 2 million border crossings during its three years in place. Observers expected a surge in migrants at the border following the end of Title 42, but the level of crossings actually fell, and the Biden administration argues that the asylum ineligibility policy has limited the number of migrants crossing the border since May. It has argued in court that the asylum ineligibility policy is necessary to control migration during a “time of heightened irregular migration throughout the Western Hemisphere.”

Government lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security anticipates that lifting the rule would mean “a return to elevated encounter levels that would place significant strain on DHS component, border communities, and interior cities.”

In his opinion Tuesday, Tigar said “[t]he Rule — which has been in effect for two months — cannot remain in place, and vacating the challenged Rule would restore a regulatory regime that was in place for decades before.”

Advocacy groups that sued the government to stop the rule from going into effect celebrated the ruling, but said it was past time to lift the asylum ineligibility rule.

Katrina Eiland, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, who argued the case, said, “The ruling is a victory, but each day the Biden administration prolongs the fight over its illegal ban, many people fleeing persecution and seeking safe harbor for their families are instead left in grave danger.”

Keren Zwick, director of litigation at the National Immigrant Justice Center, said, “U.S. laws protect the rights of people fleeing persecution to come to this country and pursue asylum, full stop. We encourage the Biden administration to now direct its resources to upholding that right, rather than fighting to continue this unlawful and inhumane asylum ban.”"

Aug 31 2023,"Hurricane Idalia cleanup may be hampered by Florida immigration law, workers say",NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/news/latino/hurricane-idalia-florida-cleanup-immigrants-desantis-law-rcna102717,"As Florida residents emerged from Hurricane Idalia on Thursday, some have started to assess the trail of destruction the storm left behind — and this included a group of Latinos who started cleaning up the severely damaged hotel where they work.

Alberto, Maggie and Jorge Vidal were among dozens of construction and agricultural workers who sheltered inside a 30-room hotel in the city of Perry. The Vidals had relocated to Florida from Mexico a year ago to work in construction, and Idalia was the first hurricane they've ever endured.

""In Mexico, we had never experienced a catastrophe like this,"" Jorge Vidal told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. He recalled hearing the windows of the hotel crack. The wind gusts that seeped in blew everything away, including parts of the hotel's ceiling, and the rain flooded some of the rooms.

Shortly after the storm passed, the Vidals, who also work in the hotel where they sheltered, started cleaning up the debris and assessing the damage even before the hotel's manager was able to return to the building, Noticias Telemundo reported.

That's when it became clear to Maggie Vidal that immigrant construction workers like herself will be key to rebuilding what Idalia destroyed.

Damages from Idalia could surpass $9 billion, according to an estimate from UBS Bank.

""This is where all the immigrants that the governor wants to push out are needed,"" Maggie Vidal told Noticias Telemundo in Spanish. ""Who is going to do all of this work? There is a lot, a lot of work here.""

Maggie Vidal was referring to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ stringent immigration law that went into effect July 1. The law, also known as SB 1718, imposes restrictions and penalties to deter the employment of undocumented workers in Florida.

The law makes it a felony to “knowingly and willfully” transport an undocumented person into the state (including relatives and acquaintances), invalidates out-of-state driver’s licenses issued to immigrants who lack legal status and requires hospitals that accept Medicaid to ask about immigration status (though patients may decline to answer the question).

In the last months, some farm and construction workers have moved out the state because of fears around the law.

Before Idalia made landfall in Florida’s Big Bend on Wednesday morning, Latino and immigrant rights organizations in the state worried about the law potentially limiting their ability to help immigrant families prepare for the storm.

Twenty-five of these organizations sent a letter to DeSantis asking him to ""issue a public statement suspending immigration enforcement by state and local authorities"" in areas where a state of emergency has been declared and where residents are evacuating, sheltering or returning to their homes after the storm.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the actions of immigration enforcement agencies such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, released a statement Tuesday reminding the public that ""ICE and CBP do not conduct immigration enforcement activities at protected areas"" providing emergency response and relief.

“The well-being and safety of all residents, regardless of their immigration status, should be a top priority during times of crisis,” Paula Muñoz of the Florida Immigrant Coalition, one of the organizations to cosign the letter, said in a statement Wednesday. “We urge Governor DeSantis to demonstrate strong leadership by ensuring that no one is deterred from accessing shelter and necessary assistance due to immigration concerns.”

Shelters are not required to ask anyone about immigration status under SB 1718.

As the Federal Emergency Management Agency responds to Idalia's aftermath, it clarified that undocumented immigrants do not qualify for federal emergency assistance programs. But relatives who are U.S. citizens and others with green cards, certain visas or other types of immigration protections may be able to access some aid, according to the Florida Immigrant Coalition."
Jul 17 2023,"Migrant workers, advocates sue Florida over immigration law",WFLA,center,https://wfla.com/news/politics/migrant-workers-advocates-sue-florida-over-immigration-law,"MIAMI, Fla. (WFLA) – Migrant workers and legal advocate groups are filing a lawsuit challenging Florida’s newest immigration law, Senate Bill 1718, which some consider to be the state’s toughest immigration crackdown to date.

Due to SB 1718 taking effect, some out-of-state driver’s licenses are no longer valid in Florida. The groups suing allege that the law is “unconstitutional.”

According to a press release, the complaint states that Section 10 of the bill is “unconstitutional for a state to unilaterally regulate federal immigration and subject people to criminal punishment without fair notice,” adding that the state’s use of the term “inspection” is “incoherent and unconstitutionally vague.”

The federal lawsuit was filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice and American Immigration Council.

“As news of the predictable damage inflicted on Florida by SB 1718 comes in, we are filing this lawsuit to stop its unconstitutional criminalization of the immigrant community in a state where one-fifth of the population was born abroad. This legislation is not the solution to any problem. It is an attempt to scapegoat and terrorize vulnerable families and workers already burdened by the difficulty of the federal immigration process, and to pick a fight with the federal government in order to serve the ambitions of a few politicians. Our challenge aims to uphold the Constitution and protect our communities from the rising threat of discrimination posed by this new Florida law,” Amien Kacou, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida said in a statement.

The case was filed against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, Florida Statewide Prosecutor Nicholas B. Cox and the attorneys general for all 20 Florida Judicial Circuits.

The groups argue that Section 10 is only one of a host of new laws within SB 1718 that “harm Florida immigrants and their families.”

Aside from Florida limiting which out-of-state licenses are valid in the state, the law also requires new hires to have a work status check if the hiring business has 25 or more employees. It also strengthens penalties against those who knowingly hire or transport undocumented immigrants in the state.

An individual plaintiff said they’re suing because the harms their family and many others, when they “aren’t doing anything to hurt anyone.”

“I’m suing because this law harms our family and many others. We aren’t doing anything to hurt anyone. On the contrary, we’re here working, paying taxes and trying to provide a safe life for our families. Now we’re scared to even travel together as a family. I would never want my son to face a felony for traveling with his mother and his sister. It makes no sense. We’re family — how can this be?” the plaintiff said in a statement.

On Monday, the Governor’s Office released a statement regarding the lawsuit, calling it “outrageous and abhorrent.”

The ACLU has for years drifted increasingly leftward and out of the American mainstream. Long are the days when the ACLU defended actual civil liberties, such as free speech and religious rights. But taking the side of human smugglers–something truly outrageous and abhorrent–wasn’t on our bingo card. Nevertheless, in Florida, we will continue to fight illegal immigration and the evil predations of human smuggling. We look forward to defending Florida and its humane laws against attacks by the ACLU and its leftist cronies. Jeremy T. Redfern, Press Secretary for the Governor’s Office

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami. The complaint can be found here."
May 10 2023,Gov. DeSantis signs Florida immigration bill,NewsNation,center,https://newsnationnow.com/us-news/southeast/gov-desantis-signs-florida-immigration-bill,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (WFLA) — At a news conference Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an immigration bill sent to his desk by the Florida legislature.

DeSantis decried “Biden’s border crisis” as he spoke at Miller Electric Company in Jacksonville’s Southpoint area.

“We’re bracing for some turbulent times ahead when you have a president who has turned a blind eye to what’s gone on at the border,” DeSantis said. “I don’t think he’s even visited the border the whole time he’s been in office.”

President Biden toured the southern border in El Paso this January.

The 43-page bill, SB-1718, invalidates any driver’s licenses or ID cards issued to “unauthorized immigrants” in other states. It also requires hospitals to collect information regarding patients’ immigration status on admission forms and requires them to submit that information to the state.

DeSantis pointed out that is already against the law for employers to hire undocumented people, but added that the bill’s new requirements for the E-Verify system will “make it enforceable.”

The bill also establishes a “Domestic Security Oversight Council” made up of various state officials and law enforcement. The council will “provide executive direction and leadership with respect to terrorism and immigration enforcement incident prevention, preparation, protection, response and recovery efforts,” according to the text of the bill.

HB-1718 also removes language from Florida State Statutes that allows people who were brought into the country illegally as children (known as “Dreamers”) to practice law in the state.

Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis spoke at the news conference regarding crime committed by what he called “illegal aliens.” He thanked DeSantis and Republican leadership in the legislature for “taking tragedy and turning it into something good.”

Nienhuis discussed the case of Pinellas County Deputy Sheriff Michael Hartwick, who died while on duty in September 2022. Hartwick was struck by a forklift driven by an undocumented construction worker.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Musk revealed he will be visiting Eagle Pass, Texas, later in the week after speaking with Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas), who confirmed the severity of the illegal immigration crisis in the area.

Musk’s comment came in response to a video showing hundreds of people sitting and standing on top of trains going from Mexico to Eagle Pass.

“I spoke with Rep. Tony Gonzales tonight – he confirmed that it is a serious issue,” Musk wrote. “They are being overwhelmed by unprecedented numbers – just hit an all-time high and still growing! Am going to visit Eagle Pass later this week to see what’s going on for myself.”

Am going to visit Eagle Pass later this week to see what’s going on for myself. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 26, 2023

Eagle Pass Mayor Rolando Salinas declared an emergency as the city saw an influx of migrants crossing the border.

“The City of Eagle Pass is committed to the safety and well being of our local citizens,” Salinas wrote in a statement. “The emergency declaration grants us the ability to request financial resources to provide the additional services caused by the influx of the document immigrants.”

Troops from the Texas National Guard and the Department of Public Safety arrived in Eagle Pass in order to help get the situation under control after Salinas declared an emergency.

So far in the 2023 fiscal year, Eagle Pass has reported 270,000 encounters with illegal migrants.

Musk has acknowledged the border crisis in several instances prior to him revealing he would be visiting the border.

Border Patrol has reported more than 1.8 million encounters with illegal migrants crossing the border within the past 12 months. During the month of August, Border Patrol reported seeing 181,059 migrant encounters, according to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website.

On Monday, Border Patrol officers reported roughly 11,000 migrant encounters at the southern border, according to Fox News.

In recent weeks, several Democratic politicians such as New York City Mayor Eric Adams and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser have been speaking out against the influx of migrants coming to their cities."
Sep 12 2023,"Gov. Cox, other governors plan to tackle immigration as part of ‘Disagree Better’ campaign",Deseret News,center,https://deseret.com/2023/9/12/23869958/gov-spencer-cox-disagree-better-campaign,"Gov. Spencer Cox speaks during the PBS Utah Governor’s Monthly News Conference at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Aug. 17, 2023. Cox is chairman of the National Governors Association and is promoting civility in politics.

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox is continuing his campaign to try to convince Americans to “Disagree Better” with a series of bipartisan events in New Hampshire this week.

Cox, a Republican and chair of the National Governors Association, and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, also a Republican, invited their fellow governors, along with students and experts, to talk about toxic polarization in the U.S.

At a press conference Tuesday, Cox said in previous generations politicians did a better job of working together, and he hoped to help bring that attitude back.

Can we ‘disagree better’ on immigration?

Cox wants to walk the talk, too. As chair of the National Governors Association, he had to choose an issue that governors could work on together, and he picked a tricky one: immigration.

A bipartisan subcommittee with eight governors met for the first time and got into the weeds of the issue, he said.

“Immigration is a federal issue — the Constitution makes that very clear — but states play an important role,” he said. “We think that we can give some cover to Congress as they start to work on this because there are things that people agree on.”

For example, he said, most Democrats believe the country should have a secure border and most Republicans believe the immigration system needs reform.

“You won’t hear that from the politicians because they love to fundraise and divide us on this one,” he said.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said it wasn’t about “demonizing the person with whom you disagree.”

Asking smart questions — like how can we help the migrants get jobs so that they can contribute to their families and the economy — can be more useful, she said.

Cox criticized Congress and the executive branch, under both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, for focusing on “showmanship,” where “if you’re extreme, you get the clicks, you get the media attention, you get the quotes on the cable news.”

“This is not about agreeing on everything,” he said. “It’s about disagreeing the right way and we can do that.”

Is America polarized?

In a press release announcing the New Hampshire events, Cox said, “Americans are tired of the nasty and endless bickering that characterizes our politics and gets in the way of solving our biggest problems.”

“Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, we all love this country, and it is critical that we find common ground and constructive ways to work together to solve our challenges. We can debate ideas without attacking each other,” he said.

Cox started the yearlong “Disagree Better” initiative in July to help Americans deal with conflict in a healthy way, according to his website.

Some experts say polarization in America could push the country to the brink of another Civil War, while others say it is an illusion.

Americans across the political spectrum share policy preferences while often the politicians who represent them are very ideologically polarized, explained Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace’s democracy, conflict and governance program.

“When polarization becomes a winning political strategy, democracy fails,” Kleinfeld, a keynote speaker at the event, said.

Instead of being fueled by ideology, Americans are polarized emotionally, where they harbor dislike for members of the other party, and allow those feelings to “interact with voting systems, candidate incentives, and personal relationships,” according to her study.

The “Disagree Better” events planned for this week include panel discussions, a debate facilitated by Braver Angels, a nonprofit dedicated to political depolarization, and a service project led by the first lady of Utah, Abby Cox.

“Politicization is hitting our classrooms in the worst possible ways. We need our educators to feel supported so that they can continue to inspire the leaders and the thinkers,” Abby Cox said, directing attendees to write a note to a teacher in their life.

Examples of bipartisanship from earlier politicians

During a panel discussion Tuesday, Robert M. Gates, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense appointed by former President George W. Bush and retained by former President Barack Obama, gave a keynote address and answered questions.

Gates pointed to the unlikely friendship that the conservative Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch and the liberal Massachusetts Sen. Edward “Ted” Kennedy shared.

Not only were they great friends, they were colleagues who worked together, he said.

Chairing the Labor and Human Resources Committee, the two “rose above partisanship and worked together” on important legislation, like the Americans With Disabilities Act, said Gates.

Cox also spoke about bringing back bipartisanship that existed decades ago at the press conference. He recalled Gates’ example about the respectful relationship shared by two other political opposites — former President Ronald Reagan and Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas “Tip” O’Neill, Jr.

“Where are the Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neills today?” Cox asked. “Well, here they are. They’re boring governors who are doing this work mostly in obscurity.”

The Utah governor said politicians and the media are responsible for the rise in polarization, which he said he hopes to help undo.

Gov. Cox gives advice on disagreeing better

The Utah governor gave advice to those who want to be more open to engaging with others they disagree with.

“One of the problems we have today is that we’ve started defining ourselves by our political backgrounds,” he said.

“I don’t know when that happened, but that certainly was not the case when I was growing up. It wasn’t even the case 10 years ago,” Cox said. “You would define yourself first as a Utahn or an American, first, as a Utah Jazz fan or a New England Patriots fan. Your politics was way down the list.”

But the fact that it’s topping the list now is “incredibly dangerous,” he said. Still, two people who might disagree can choose to listen to each other and ask questions, Cox said. And this is a great starting point.

“Don’t just mute everybody who disagrees with you, either in real life or on social media,” he concluded. “And actually spend time with people who are different than you.”"
Aug 12 2020,Immigration,Whitehouse.gov,left,https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/,"President Biden will deliver bold action and immediate relief for American families as the country grapples with converging crises. This will include actions to control the COVID-19 pandemic, provide economic relief, tackle climate change, and advance racial equity and civil rights, as well as immediate actions to reform our immigration system and restore America’s standing in the world.

COVID-19

President Biden will move quickly to contain the COVID-19 crisis by expanding testing, safely reopening schools and businesses, and taking science-driven steps to address the communities — especially communities of color — who have been hardest hit by this virus. And, President Biden will launch a national vaccination program to inoculate the U.S. population efficiently and equitably.

Read more about the Biden-Harris plan to beat COVID-19

Climate

President Biden will take swift action to tackle the climate crisis. To meet the demands of science, the President is mobilizing a whole-of-government effort to reduce climate pollution in every sector of the economy and increase resilience to climate impacts. The Biden Administration will create good-paying, union jobs to build a modern and sustainable infrastructure, deliver an equitable clean energy future, and put the United States on a path to achieve net-zero emissions, economy-wide, by no later than 2050.

Racial Equity

The promise of our nation is that every American has an equal chance to get ahead, yet persistent systemic racism and barriers to opportunity have denied this promise for so many. President Biden is putting equity at the center of the agenda with a whole of government approach to embed racial justice across Federal agencies, policies, and programs. And President Biden will take bold action to advance a comprehensive equity agenda to deliver criminal justice reform, end disparities in healthcare access and education, strengthen fair housing, and restore Federal respect for Tribal sovereignty, among other actions, so that everyone across America has the opportunity to fulfill their potential.

Economy

President Biden will take bold steps to address the inequities in our economy and provide relief to those who are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The President will also work with Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan to change the course of the pandemic, build a bridge towards economic recovery, and invest in racial justice. And, he will build our economy back better from the pandemic and create millions of jobs by strengthening small businesses and investing in the jobs of the future.

Health Care

President Biden will make a renewed commitment to protect and expand Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care. He will build on the Affordable Care Act to meet the health care needs created by the pandemic, reduce health care costs, and make our health care system less complex to navigate.

Immigration

President Biden will reform our long-broken and chaotic immigration system. President Biden’s strategy is centered on the basic premise that our country is safer, stronger, and more prosperous with a fair and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families together, and allows people across the country—both newly arrived immigrants and people who have lived here for generations—to more fully contribute to our country.

Restoring America’s Global Standing

President Biden will take steps to restore America’s standing in the world, strengthening the U.S. national security workforce, rebuilding democratic alliances across the globe, championing America’s values and human rights, and equipping the American middle class to succeed in a global economy."
Dec 01 2016,Two Immigrants Debate Immigration,Reason,right,https://reason.com/archives/2016/11/25/two-immigrants-debate-immigrat,"Even as the mighty Statue of Liberty beckons the world's ""poor and huddled masses"" to America's shores, Americans themselves have been ambivalent, to put it mildly, about how many newcomers ought to be welcomed and from where. To the extent that a pro-immigration consensus has existed, it was always an uneasy one. But Donald Trump's meteoric political rise after embracing an extreme restrictionist agenda has shattered that fragile status quo, dividing pundits and public, academics and analysts throughout the 2016 election season. There's an absence of good polling data to shine a light on how immigrants themselves feel about this issue, but it's clear that even they don't all agree.

George J. Borjas is a celebrated Harvard University economist who emigrated from Cuba to the United States with his mother at the age of 12, three years after Fidel Castro's regime took over the country and confiscated his father's garment factory. He has made vital contributions to many fields of economics, especially immigration, and has a new book, We Wanted Workers: Unraveling the Immigration Narrative, out this month. In it, he challenges the notion that immigration is ""universally beneficial.""

Shikha Dalmia is a Reason Foundation analyst and a native of New Delhi, India, who came to America 31 years ago as an idealistic student looking to escape the corruption of a socialistic mixed economy. She writes extensively about immigration and firmly believes America shuts the door on outsiders at its economic and spiritual peril.

What follows is a spirited exchange between the two on the empirical claims and proposed policy prescriptions in We Wanted Workers.

Dear Professor Borjas:

Let me congratulate you on a book that is a model of clarity. We Wanted Workers systematically walks readers through the immigration literature. Along the way, it offers a sense of the immensely knotty methodological problems that bedevil the dismal science. Also, I agree completely that the ""overreliance on economic modeling and statistical findings"" on this subject is a regrettable development that fosters the notion that ""purely technocratic determinations of public policy"" are possible. In fact, the scientific hubris underlying such efforts prevents a full airing of the normative and ideological commitments that ultimately do—and perhaps should—guide policy.

That said, the more I read, the more despondent I got. The publisher's teaser promises that the book ""takes a fresh and thought-provoking new look"" that parses the claims on the ""two extreme poles"" of those calling for ""tougher laws…in a racially tinged discourse"" on one end and those pushing for ""more open policies"" on the other. But the book focused almost exclusively on the second target while largely ignoring the first, even when its own facts warranted a smackdown.

You point out that the pro-immigration camp's claims that America is a magnet for the ""best and brightest"" are overblown because which foreigners—high-skilled or low-skilled—make a beeline for America depends on how well their skills are rewarded in their own country. Highly egalitarian countries such as Denmark lose their highly skilled workers because, relative to less-skilled counterparts, their labor is rewarded less well, whereas the reverse is the case in highly inegalitarian countries such as Mexico. That's an interesting thesis, but it doesn't explain India, my native country, which has extreme inequality and is among the biggest ""donors"" of high-skilled talent. It was odd that you shoehorned India into the same category as Canada and Australia as a country with ""less inequality.""

But America's genius is not that it draws the best people but that it draws out the best from people, which is why even the world's ""wretched"" manage to make something of themselves here. Indeed, the essential thing for ""success"" is not a college degree but drive, which those with the cojones to uproot themselves and make the difficult schlep to a foreign land have in spades. This process of self-selection has served America—and immigrants—so well that even the restrictionist lobby hasn't questioned it. But you devote a whole chapter to lamenting the forces of ""self-selection"" that thwart Uncle Sam's efforts to ensure that immigrants who come to America are ""exactly the types the country is looking for."" Putting more faith in government over markets to properly regulate labor flows isn't very American!

But even if one accepts that the ""best and brightest"" trope is oversimplified, it's at least partly true. Not so with the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration. These things occur, but are hardly widespread phenomena. Consider chain migration. Restrictionists allege that letting immigrants sponsor non-nuclear family members sets off a chain reaction as immigrants sponsor their relatives to come to America who sponsor more relatives…until entire Third World villages are emptied into America! But the only ""non-nuclear"" relatives that citizens or permanent residents are allowed to sponsor are siblings. What's more, there is a strict annual national quota on the number that can be admitted from each country. This produces long wait times that currently touch 23 years for siblings of Filipino immigrants, making widespread chain migration a virtual impossibility. You acknowledge all these facts but never connect the dots to say as much. There are many such omissions.

We Wanted Workers confirms the hardline restrictionist narrative that low-skilled immigrants don't assimilate economically, meaning that their wages lag behind other groups. I appreciate that you blame this not on their ethnicity, as is the wont of the racist restrictionists, but on their entering skill levels, which track the nations they come from. Comparing German and Mexican immigrants, you note that the 30 percent wage gap that existed between them in 1920 had narrowed to 10 percent in 2000, lamenting that the melting pot worked but took close to 100 years. My initial reaction to this was ""So what—so long as these groups are making progress relative to their own aspirations?"" But to truly know how well the melting pot is melting, we need to compare not various immigrant groups to each other, but immigrant groups relative to natives in the same socio-economic strata. In other words, how do the children and grandchildren of Mexican drywall hangers compare with those of Americans doing similar jobs? If Mexican grandchildren own mid-sized construction companies and American ones remain drywall hangers, surely that would better indicate how rapidly immigrants assimilate.

You question not just the impact of low skilled immigrants on American wages and jobs but also, astonishingly, the high-skilled immigrants that most accept as positive. You say that your fellow economists exaggerate that economic migrants are complements to—rather than substitutes for—American workers and therefore underestimate the downward pressure on native employment and wages. Moreover, you believe that low-skilled immigrants have negative productivity spillover effects—meaning that their habits depress the productivity of the overall economy, not enhance it—while high-skilled immigrants have positive productivity effects, but they are too small to offset their other negative economic impacts on natives.

I will let the experts parse the controversial methodology underlying these claims and simply take them at face value for now. With respect to low-skilled immigrants, the very worst long-term consequence you identify is a 3.1 percent reduction in the wages of native high school dropouts, a vanishing subset of the population. So even if you are right that immigration enthusiasts overstate their claims, isn't this a pretty small downside? No policy has zero losers, after all. The question is whether the wins outweigh the losses.

But it was your discussion about high-skilled immigration that was truly eye-popping. You insist that high-skilled natives are vulnerable to ""supply shocks"" just like their low-skilled counterparts and explain how an influx of Russian math Ph.D.s drove American math Ph.D.s to pursue different careers. But it is not clear why pushing natives into areas where they can better compete is a bad thing. This may be acceptable, you claim, if these immigrants triggered big productivity gains and, stunningly, offer the example of Albert Einstein to show that's not the case. His dismissal, along with other Jewish physicists from Nazi Germany, you say, did not lower the publication rate of their German departments ""at all""—and, presumably, by corollary didn't boost the rate of their new American departments.

But if this example reveals anything it is the glaring inadequacy of your ""publication"" metric that couldn't capture the contributions of an incandescent genius who changed the trajectory of human history, making America the formidable giant in theoretical science. (Same with his Princeton colleague, the math genius Kurt Gödel, an Austrian immigrant.) Surely, if we are going to question anything, it is your instrument rather than the contributions of such immigrants? You say that the cardinal mistake of the pro-immigration camp is that it treats immigrants like widgets rather than people whose personal baggage negatively affects the institutions of their adopted country. But certainly such petty bean counting so devoid of qualitative dimensions is also guilty of this mistake?

Your most scathing observation is that immigration, not counting the fiscal costs on schools, welfare, and other government programs, produces a $50 billion economic surplus, but that this essentially benefits employers, the users of immigrants—not American workers, the competitors of immigrants. In essence, you state, this implies a ""redistribution of half-a-trillion dollars from workers to firms."" But if that's the case, then every search for efficiency—every groundbreaking innovation, every new trade deal, every revolutionary technology—that disrupts existing employment patterns is tantamount to the redistribution of wealth from labor to capital. If so, your quarrel isn't with immigration but with the market economy.

Based on this downbeat assessment, you endorse a sweeping restrictionist agenda that opposes legalization of the undocumented population unless we've ""regained control of the border,"" and you advocate serious penalties on employers who hire undocumented workers and an E-Verify mandate on employers. Not surprisingly, you don't entertain an end to the current regime of labor prohibitionism against low-skilled workers by reviving the Bracero guest worker program with Mexico, the only effective way of stanching the future flow of illegal immigrants. And far from expanding the visa quotas for high-skilled workers, despite industry pleading, you want to jack up the fees for H-1Bs.

To your credit, you openly acknowledge that a ""massive new government"" will be required to ""supervise a massive wealth redistribution""—and, I might add, disrupt the natural pattern of human mobility that would emerge if Americans and foreigners were left relatively unfettered to associate with each other according to their preferences.

To put my ideological commitments on the table, in my mind such draconian curbs on individual liberty are justified only when there are worse harms to be mitigated. But even if all the harms you list were correct, that won't add up to the level of those that an overweening government might cause to get the ""correct"" distribution of income. So my question to you is: What role, if any, does the need to protect individual liberty, mobility rights, and freedom of association play in your thinking on immigration policy?

Yours sincerely,

Shikha

Dear Shikha,

I am pleased you found the book valuable and accessible. Let me try to respond by addressing some of the questions you raise and raising some of my own.

You claim that I devote a disproportionate amount of time to debunking the claims of immigration enthusiasts, but much less to debunking restrictionists. I want to address this point head on, as I truly tried to expose myths regardless of their source. For instance, I thought I gave equal time to dismissing the polar claims that immigrants are the ""best and the brightest"" or ""the wretched refuse of those teeming shores."" As I write in the book: ""There has been an enduring interest in how immigrants are self-selected, and it is customary to pick one of two extremes when describing the selection…I find these types of ideologically motivated assumptions and platitudes thoroughly unconvincing.""

A little intellectual history may help. I began to think about immigrant selection in 1985, a time when immigration was far removed from the center of social policy concerns. So my interest had nothing to do with policy. It reflected my curiosity about a technical question: What does economics have to say about the self-selection of immigrants? If people move from place to place in search of higher incomes, which types of people—the ""best and brightest"" or the ""wretched refuse""—find it worthwhile to pick up and move? That question had a surprising answer: It depends on whether the U.S. offers higher rewards for skills than the sending countries. If we do, we attract the best and the brightest. If we don't, we won't.

Pretty obvious, right? But my question had nothing to do with ideology. And this is one way in which you and I differ. You seem to interpret models and results through an ideological filter. Each ""factoid"" in the book is judged according to how it fits a preconceived notion of how the world should work. I read the same factoids and I think about the underlying economic question: What is driving the market to reach such an outcome?

There may be another reason why you get the feeling that I leave the restrictionists alone. You note that I avoided talking about ""the poisonous myths of the restrictionist right about anchor babies and chain migration. No doubt these alleged problems occur, but they are hardly widespread phenomena.""

There is a very simple reason for why only some issues ended up in the book. Those are the questions that have preoccupied economists over the past few decades. There have been remarkably few studies—and no single study that someone who is not an immigration specialist would find worth reading—of anchor babies and chain migration.

It is not that these other issues are not important. But they may not be sufficiently attractive to an economist wishing to write a paper that can propel a career forward, or they cannot be framed in a simple way, or the data are really bad. Economists are rational human beings too. They will pursue topics that offer the greatest opportunity for professional gains. A fair portrayal of the topics that ended up in the book is that they cover those issues that were of major concern to economists and that led to major advances in our understanding.

Let me now address the wage impact of immigration. This is not the place to go into the many technical details that confound consumers of this very technical literature. But you say something that resonates (and not in a good way): ""The very worst long-term consequence of immigration that you identify is a 3.1 percent reduction in the wages of high school dropouts…Even if you are right that immigration enthusiasts have overstated their claims that immigration generates no losers at all, isn't this a pretty small downside?""

You are referring to my conclusion that the earnings of high school dropouts fell by 3 to 6 percent because of immigration. I specifically address the issue you raise in the book: ""The economic, social, and political consequences of pursuing policies that harm the most disadvantaged Americans are ignored at our peril."" Just look at our current political landscape. I think it is extremely shortsighted to dismiss the impact on low-skill workers by arguing that few workers are affected in this fashion or that the effect is small. The typical male high school dropout earns $29,000 annually. A policy-mandated pay cut of $900 to $1,700 is not trivial, and it suggests that the policy makers perhaps have their priorities all wrong.

You raise an important point about the small $50 billion immigration surplus that the textbook economic model produces, and the huge $500 billion redistribution that goes alongside it, asking whether perhaps my ""quarrel isn't with immigration, but the market economy.""

I have no ""quarrel"" with a market economy. My argument is instead that a candid appraisal should not sweep the distributional effects of immigration under the rug. And it should incorporate the insight embodied in Max Frisch's observation about the guest workers that Germany admitted back in the 1960s: ""We wanted workers, but we got people instead."" Immigrants are more than the robotic workers that populate the models used in the ""search for efficiency."" And that fact generates additional wrinkles. For instance, the evidence already suggests that the $50 billion surplus disappears entirely if we account for the fiscal burden imposed by immigration. In other words, a fuller appraisal might have to recognize that, in the end, immigration is just another government redistribution program.

Admirably, you affirm where you are coming from when it comes to immigration restrictions: ""In my mind such draconian curbs on individual liberty are justified only when there are worse harms to be mitigated."" You then ask me where I stand: ""What role, if any, does the need to protect individual liberty, mobility rights, and freedom of association play in your thinking on immigration policy?""

My answer will surely shock you, but I have never devoted much time to thinking about that. My research was never motivated or influenced by what I thought about individual liberty or the rights of people to live anywhere they want. My personal experience with Communist indoctrination when I was 10 and 11 years old left me very wary of thinking about anything in ideological terms.

Your question is more specific, however. How do these tenets of libertarianism affect my thinking about immigration policy? And my answer, again, will shock you. They don't enter my thinking at all. I myself would not trust my moralizing about what is right and what is wrong. As much as I wish I were a perfect human being with pure motivations and in possession of all the answers, I know I am not.

I tend to see both sides of the coin in everything. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we inhabited a world where everybody could move to where they wanted and lead happy and productive lives? But if a billion immigrants from the developing world were to enter Europe and North America, the developed world would surely change. And anyone with any common sense knows that some of those changes would not be to the good.

Immigration creates winners and losers, Shikha, and the net gain may not be as large as some had hoped. I hope that We Wanted Workers has at least given you some food for thought regarding that possibility. So any discussion of immigration policy has to contrast the gains accruing to the winners with the losses suffered by the losers. Who are you rooting for?

And if your answer is that you stand firmly behind the lofty axioms of mobility rights and freedom of association, then do not act surprised when the losers in that New World Order wake up, realize that the narrative is a crock, and revolt.

Best regards,

George

Dear Professor Borjas:

Thank you for your clear and candid response—and let me return the favor by being equally clear and candid. You say you strove to debunk both sides. But you didn't fully succeed, in my view. And perhaps that's because even a pre-eminent and empirically driven economist such as yourself ultimately isn't free from normative assumptions. ""Preconceived notions of how the world works"" inevitably seep into one's work. You can choose them consciously, or you can absorb them subconsciously from the broader zeitgeist. If you had no moral assumptions, how would you know whom to ""root for""?

You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths, noting that there isn't enough of a professional upside to addressing them. I certainly understand the need for beginning scholars to focus on professionally sexy research topics. But you are an established figure who published a ""popular"" book with a commercial press, in the middle of an election cycle in which one presidential candidate is trying to ride such myths to the White House. Surely, you could afford to direct some of your considerable professional status and firepower to straightening that side of the ledger too?

Both you and I are wary of economic models. Despite my pro-immigration proclivities, you could persuade me that models showing that John Lennon's utopia, where a borderless world would lead to a $40 trillion increase in the global gross domestic product, is overstated. One reason, as you note, is that they ignore all the transaction, transportation, psychic, and other costs of emigrating and assume that all workers who could boost their wages by moving would do so. That's not the case. You point out that America has no border restrictions with Puerto Rico, whose construction workers alone could double their wages by buying a ""one-way plane ticket that costs a fraction of a week's salary."" Yet ""two-thirds of Puerto Ricans have chosen not to move"" (your emphasis). This same fact can be used to undercut restrictionist claims that looser borders would instantly flood America. Yet you not just fail to note this but repeat it in your response.

""Preconceived notions"" influence not just the conclusions you draw but also the questions you ask. You posit the existing distribution of wealth as the desirable state of affairs and brand a policy that disrupts it as ""redistribution""—hardly a morally neutral term. Furthermore, you play up the long-term harm that immigration causes high-school dropouts. But that is the least persuasive part of your analysis precisely because it treats these workers like non-volitional ""widgets,"" incapable of changing their behavior to minimize the direct harm from immigration (by acquiring new skills) or taking advantage of the new opportunities (by exploiting their linguistic edge) it opens up. But even if you were right about the harm immigration causes them, arguably they may suffer more harm if businesses that can't import workers choose to export or automate away more jobs in order to remain globally competitive.

Lastly, when I asked you what role liberty plays in your thinking, I was referring to your policy prescriptions, not your research. That's because one's conclusions don't flow automatically from one's findings. Even if your findings about the economic harms of immigration were indisputable, which they are not, they may not add up to a case for restrictionism any more than the harms from free speech would add up to a case for scrapping the First Amendment. The draconian government policies that restrictionism entails—and you endorse—might be even more harmful than immigration for a nation with a bedrock commitment to individual rights and limited government. That liberty was no part of the color mix of your normative palette wasn't shocking, but it did leave me thinking that your immigration picture was too dark and distorted.

Yours sincerely,

Shikha

Dear Shikha,

I have truly enjoyed having this exchange. It is invigorating to discuss what it all means with someone from your ideological perspective who is able to extract and enunciate the core issues in such a clear and striking fashion. Let me clarify some relatively minor points before I conclude with the big picture.

One perhaps not-so-minor point is your claim that: ""You acknowledge that you stayed away from addressing poisonous restrictionist myths, noting that there isn't enough of a professional upside to addressing them."" I acknowledged no such thing. Perhaps my phrasing wasn't sufficiently clear, so let me be as clear as I can be now. We Wanted Workers focuses on issues that attracted professional interest (my own, as well as that of others) in the past three decades. Perhaps those select issues tend to fall on one side of the ideological divide rather than the other, but the ideological implications of any particular issue had nothing to do with whether they are discussed and ""unraveled"" in the book.

If you contrast the topics I cover with the topics covered in two National Academy reports (the one published in 1997, and the one to be published in September 2016), you will find an awful lot of overlap. And that is because it is hard to thoroughly survey topics—regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum—that have not been thought through carefully by many researchers before. What I do concede is that I stayed away from many topics throughout my career, including the chain migration issue that started this particular discussion. But the reason I stayed away from all those topics had nothing to do with ideology. There are only so many hours in a day and I wanted to have a family life. More often than not, I was simply not smart enough to be able to frame the problem in terms of an economic model I could easily manipulate, or I could not get access to data that would enable me to conduct a serious study of the issue.

You are not surprised that ""liberty was no part of [my] color mix"" as I spent all these years thinking about and doing research on immigration issues. There's a sophomoric joke among economists that ""we had our morals removed in graduate school,"" and I plead guilty. My thinking has never been guided by deep philosophical thoughts—a bit ironic, in retrospect, as John Rawls lived a couple of doors down from me for many years. You'd think that if spillover effects really exist, something ""in the air"" would have rubbed off. But the way I've pursued my work just reflects my own somewhat geeky interests (I had to take two or three philosophy classes in college, and absolutely detested them), and not a ""dark"" desire to spin what I was trying to say one way or the other.

Which brings me to your description of the picture painted by the book as ""dark."" This is precisely why I dislike ideological arguments. They demonize the other side in a clever and pithy way without really giving an understanding of why the picture might have turned out that way. I totally reject the notion that the book is ""dark"" in any way. I would argue instead that it is a pragmatic condensation of what we know about immigration. Reality has a way of looking very bleak to those wedded to a very narrow narrative. But facts don't kneel to ideology.

And, finally, let me get to the elephant in the room. I ended my discussion in the first round by noting that ""immigration creates winners and losers and the net gain may not be as large as some had hoped. So any discussion of immigration policy has to contrast the gains accruing to the winners with the losses suffered by the losers."" You did not address this very thorny issue in your response, so let me conclude by rephrasing it in even starker terms, as it isolates the problem at the core of our disagreement.

The evidence summarized in We Wanted Workers suggests that it is quite possible that the ""efficiency gains"" that receive so much emphasis in the libertarian narrative are totally offset by the costs associated with welfare expenditures or harmful productivity spillovers. As I said, it may well be that ""immigration is just another government redistribution program."" My italicization of ""just"" was not a random click on my track pad. It was meant to drive home the point that there is a good chance that all that immigration does is redistribute wealth.

If there are no efficiency gains to be had, then espousing any specific immigration policy is nothing but a declaration that group x is preferred to group y. It is easy to avoid clarifying who you are rooting for by trying to reframe the debate in terms of amorphous philosophical ideals about mobility rights and the like. But this is where we go our separate ways. When push comes to shove, I will side with policies that improve the well-being of the American worker.

Best regards,

George"
Sep 22 2023,Immigration border upheaval stokes fear among Eagle Pass residents: 'Send extra help',Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/immigration-border-upheaval-stokes-fear-eagle-pass-residents,"AUSTIN, Texas — An endless flow of immigrants streamed across the Rio Grande onto U.S. soil in Eagle Pass daily this week, sending the Border Patrol deep into a “catch and release” state of operations and spooking residents unaccustomed to the unfamiliar faces showing up in their once-quiet neighborhoods.

Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber, an Eagle Pass native, said “security” in town is a growing concern given how many people have already been released after entering Eagle Pass this week.

HOUSE GOP LEADERS SIGNAL POSSIBLE FUNDING BREAKTHROUGH WITH CONSERVATIVE HOLDOUTS

“I feel worried because the people in the community here, some are afraid because they see strangers walking through their neighborhood. They don’t know who they are or what their intentions are,” said Schmerber, who added that break-ins, burglaries, and drug seizures are occurring in the community.

Internal Border Patrol data viewed by the Washington Examiner revealed that 3,054 people were in custody in the Eagle Pass/Del Rio region of south-central Texas as of Thursday morning — far beyond the Border Patrol’s maximum facility capacity of 1,845.

EAGLE PASS, Texas — Thousands of migrants are coming and going from the holding area under this international bridge, mostly Venezuelan men. Early today, they waited to be transported to Border Patrol’s “Firefly” tent facility to shower and eat before being released or removed. pic.twitter.com/tx8DNeK0Bf — Anna Giaritelli (@Anna_Giaritelli) September 21, 2023

The overcapacity problem has prompted Border Patrol to process and then release or remove people as fast as possible to avoid a clog in the pipeline. It means immigrants who do not make an asylum claim will overwhelmingly be released with a notice to appear in court in several years, according to three federal officials with firsthand knowledge of how immigrants are being processed.

One federal law enforcement agent at the bridge described the past few days as “organized chaos.” Among Border Patrol agents from rank and file to management, agents feel the priority is cycling through people in order to accommodate the new arrivals that stream across every hour, day and night.

“It’s always ‘let’s get as many bodies out of here as we can,'” the agent wrote in a message. “Intake is a mess.”

But with only one nonprofit group in the remote city of 30,000 residents to receive immigrants who get released into the community, Border Patrol has been forced to release countless immigrants directly onto the street. Many immigrants have no money and no idea where to go or who to trust. San Antonio is roughly two hours away by car.

“I’m seeing them walking the street with a bag in their hand. They’re lost. They don’t know what to do,” said Eagle Pass Police Chief Federico Garza Jr.

The Eagle Pass Police Department issued a statement Thursday after receiving a shocking number of 911 calls from residents worried about individuals and groups of strangers walking through neighborhoods and loitering along roads around town.

Garza told the Washington Examiner that he is doing his best to quell citizens’ concerns, but admitted that he has his own fears for public safety given that so many people in desperate situations and with unknown intentions are being dropped off into the community.

“These individuals have already been processed by federal agencies and are more than likely walking to the local bus pickup area,” the Eagle Pass Police Department reassured residents worried about gotaways who evaded Border Patrol and were now wandering through town. “The release of these individuals is not a cause for panic or to notify law enforcement unless these individuals are in the commission of a crime or other illegal activity.”

Further stoking concerns among residents is that the majority of immigrants in Eagle Pass are single men without families as opposed to families, according to six federal and local law enforcement officers.

Immigrants who cross the Rio Grande into downtown Eagle Pass are walked by Border Patrol or state military to a staging area under a bridge before either being taken to a tent facility 12 miles outside town to shower and eat or sent to other parts of the border to be removed by agents in less-impacted regions.

Aside from the influx of people walking the streets in town, Schmerber said his deputies have been busy outside city limits with vehicle pursuits of human smugglers.

A senior Border Patrol agent who studies intelligence on migration patterns south of the border said the word is out that crossing into Eagle Pass will more than likely lead to being released onto the street — the end goal for immigrants who have paid or gone into debt to cartels who move them over the border.

“They go to Piedras Negras/Eagle Pass because they have informed each other via social media and chat rooms that they are being released quicker there than other places and given a report date of three years from their release date,” the upper management Border Patrol agent wrote in a text message.

Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) maintained in posts to X, formerly Twitter, that the state was still active at the border and effectively “repelling migrants” even though thousands have made it across the river and onto U.S. soil since Sunday.

The city remains in a state of emergency through next Tuesday.

Schmerber validated residents’ concerns given the lack of federal assistance from Washington but shrugged it off, not out of indifference but a place of helplessness.

“I haven’t seen any help from the Biden administration,” said Schmerber. “Send extra help from up north to help process so agents here can get back to work on the river.”"
Apr 29 2023,Immigration Should Be as Easy for Everyone As It Is for NBA Players,Reason,right,https://reason.com/2023/04/28/immigration-should-be-as-easy-for-everyone-as-it-is-for-nba-players/,"For a fifth straight year, the NBA's Most Valuable Player award will go to someone born outside of the United States. While the league has not yet announced the winner of the Michael Jordan Trophy, the finalists are Joel Embiid, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Cameroon-born Embiid (the league's leading scorer), Serbia's Jokic (the two-time reigning MVP), and Greek-Nigerian Antetokounmpo (who hoisted the trophy in 2019 and 2020) each turned in a superlative 2022–2023 campaign and has strong claim to the title.

Along with Slovenian guard Luka Doncic, who at the tender age of 24 has already made the All-NBA First Team three years running, Embiid, Jokic, and Antetokounmpo are becoming the defining faces of the NBA's global brand as presiding American titans LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant approach the twilight of their careers.

These immigrant stars are still in their 20s and are just four of the 120 foreign-born players that now constitute about one-third of the league, a total that is up from just 23 such players 30 seasons ago.

This injection of foreign talent has been a boon for the NBA and, in turn, for American basketball fans. League revenue is at a record high, and quality of play is as well, by many metrics. While their pure hoops talent is key, the NBA's foreign star quartet has accelerated the adoption of new, more free-flowing, all-court playing styles borrowed from the international game that have elevated the league's on-court aesthetic.

The NBA's adoption of talented individuals from around the globe provides a lesson for the wider American economy. While the NBA has been able to poach the best players the world has to offer, other key industries like technology, manufacturing, and finance have seen their available talent pools artificially limited by misguided immigration restrictions.

Major sports leagues can sponsor immigrants from any corner of the world under a dedicated visa just for professional athletes, the P-1A visa. Without much hassle, these players can legally come live and work in the U.S. Alternatively, an internationally recognized athlete could be sponsored by an agent under an O-1A visa. And if they win major international awards while playing in the NBA, they can qualify for a green card under the EB-1 category. None of these categories are subject to any labor market tests to see if Americans are displaced from a job, and they are allowed to be expedited for a fee, making wait times a matter of days.

The result is that American pro basketball is at its zenith.

But key companies in diverse industries don't have the chance to attract the best talent from around the world like the NBA does. In most cases, other for-profit businesses must use the H-1B visa—limited to a mere 85,000 per year—to sponsor college-educated employees to work for them. Demand outstrips supply, so the U.S. government conducts a lottery for the visas which, last season, resulted in fewer than 25 percent of applicants selected. Even if companies can secure an H-1B visa for their desired worker, the green card process takes years, and if the workers happened to have been born in India, then they will never obtain a green card due to arbitrary per-country caps set by Congress.

The consequences of our current anti-merit immigration system is that companies offshore offices to countries where they can attract talent. All major U.S. tech companies have opened offices in neighboring Canada, where they send mostly Indian engineers and programmers. America isn't just missing out on these highly paid immigrants' productivity and tax revenue, but also on the money they would spend at U.S. businesses, for food, haircuts, health care, and everything else. By keeping offices in the U.S., their employers would create jobs here for Americans, such as administrative staff, construction workers, and electricians.

America's population is less than 5 percent of the world's total. There are millions more talented people living outside the U.S. than inside. Attracting the world's top talent in every field isn't just good for America's economy, it's also the most powerful tool to deprive rivals like China of economic brainpower. Welcoming immigrants to work in tech and the rest of the economy, as the NBA does, will have powerful economic benefits."
Aug 21 2023,"Abbott hosts Republican governors at border buoys, ‘ground zero’ for illegal immigration",WANE 15,center,https://wane.com/border-report-tour/texas-governor-hosts-visiting-governors-at-border-buoys-where-they-say-texas-is-ground-zero-for-illegal-immigration,"EAGLE PASS, Texas (Border Report) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday showed off to four fellow Republican governors the controversial new border buoys installed as part of his border security initiative in the middle of the Rio Grande in this South Texas border town.

After the tour, in response to a question from Border Report, Abbott confirmed that the State of Texas has moved the string of buoys farther north toward the U.S. shore. This came after a survey last week by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) found most of the buoys in the 1,000-foot-long string were actually on the Mexican side of the international river.

“The buoys had drifted toward the Mexico side. And so out of an abundance of caution, Texas went back and moved the buoys to a location where it is clear they are on the United States side, not on the Mexican side,” Abbott said at a news conference after the group’s aerial tour of the border.

Abbott was joined by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds; Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen; Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on the banks of the Rio Grande overlooking the Mexican border town of Piedras Negras.

All four visiting governors declared the immigration situation on the South Texas border a “crisis” and used words like “war zone” and “ground zero” to describe the situation.

“Texas has been ground zero for over two years because of the Biden-created catastrophe that we see at the southern border, whether it’s a lack of security or public safety. It’s just an assault on our democracy,” Reynolds said.

Pillen said he is a pig farmer and he declared criticisms toward the marine buoy “hogwash.”

“It’s a misrepresentation of what’s happening on the border,” Pillen said. “We are fighting cartels that are trying to kill our kids. We have to do the work.”

Abbott said that all four visiting governors have pledged to send troops to the Texas border from their state.

“They are deploying military and/or law enforcement officers to help Texas secure the border,” Abbott said.

Altogether, Abbott says that 15 states have pledged to send law enforcement to Texas’ border, and 10 other states are sending various other kinds of support.

“Half of the states of the United States of America are banding together to step up and secure a border that President Biden has abandoned,” Abbott said.

Their visit came after the Department of Homeland Security on Friday released immigration border apprehension statistics for July, which found illegal crossings dramatically increased by one-third from June. This included over 60,000 migrant families arrested crossing the Southwest border in July, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.

The Justice Department has sued Abbott and the State of Texas saying the 1,000-foot-long string of spherical buoys violate the Rivers and Harbor Act of 1899, which “prohibits the unauthorized obstruction or alteration of any navigable water of the U.S.” That includes “construction of any structure in or over any navigable water of the U.S., or the accomplishment of any other work affecting the course, location, condition, or physical capacity of such waters,” according to the law.

A hearing on the case is set for Tuesday in Austin.

Texas has spent over $5 billion on Operation Lone Star since it started in 2021.

In a tweet prior to his visit, Stitt boasted about sending Oklahoma National Guard “to help to Texas to help clean up Biden’s Border Crisis,” he wrote.

After the tour, he told media, “Every state is a border state and Oklahoma is a border state to Texas.”

Stitt said deaths from fentanyl have increased by 500% in the past year and he attributes it to drugs crossing the border from Mexico.

“We came here and are witnessing a war zone,” Noem, of South Dakota said Monday after the tour.

The group of governors spoke to the media Monday at Shelby Park, the same location the mayor of Eagle Pass had converted the into private land so Operation Lone Star forces and equipment could be staged there, including the massive buoys. But last month, the Eagle Pass City Council voted to rescind that order and keep the park open to the public.

The park was blocked off to the public Monday due to the visits.

Standing outside of a line guarded by Texas state troopers, Jose Corpus, of Eagle Pass, held a sign reading “WE WANT OUR PARK BACK.”

Eagle Pass resident Americus Garcia was beside him. She opposes the border buoys and told Border Report the devices are inhumane and unnecessary.

“They aren’t even in the United States. They’re in Mexico. So they aren’t a barrier in any way, shape or form. The buoys are a complete failure, just like Operation Lone Star,” Garcia said.

A representative from the Mexican division of the IBWC was on the border watching the buoys on Monday afternoon. He told Border Report that construction to move the buoy string into U.S. territory began Thursday afternoon and was nearly completed.

Mike Banks, Texas’ border czar who was appointed by Abbott, told Border Report the string prevents migrants from crossing because of its design. They can’t climb over it, he said.

“If you try to climb on the buoy, the buoy will roll back to prevent you from climbing on it,” Banks said.

He added that a metal circle in between the 4-foot spherical balls is “to prevent tampering,” not designed to hurt migrants.

On Monday, Border Report witnessed several migrants walk around the buoy string. They said they were from Colombia and Honduras.

And while they weren’t injured going around the buoys, several suffered cut feet and legs from trying to climb the concertina wire at a gap in the fencing.

Jul 27 2023,"DOJ Sues Texas Over Makeshift Border, Reignites Immigration Debate",Daily Citizen,right,https://dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com/doj-sues-texas-over-makeshift-border-reignites-immigration-debate,"The Department of Justice (DOJ) is suing Texas Governor Greg Abbott (Texas) for using marine buoys to prevent migrants from crossing the Rio Grande River to enter America illegally.

The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, alleges the buoy barrier violates the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act, which prevents wharves, piers and other structures from blocking navigable rivers without federal approval.

“Texas will see you in court, Mr. President,” vowed Abbott in a letter challenging the DOJ’s allegations. In addition to denying the buoys violate the Rivers and Harbors Act, Abbott asserts it’s within his power as governor to reinforce Texas’ borders.

This latest salvo in the nationwide battle over immigration policy has been foreshadowed for years.

The contested buoy blockade is part of an immigration initiative launched by Abbott in 2021 — Operation Lone Star — that has reportedly led to the apprehension of more than 390,500 illegal immigrants, 28,700 felony arrests and the confiscation of more than 421 million fatal doses of fentanyl.

Despite scorching criticism and political pressure, the governor has remained a stalwart proponent of strong borders, writing the White House a total of three times since November concerning the rise illegal immigration over Texas’ Southwestern border.

Meanwhile, the DOJ has started to crack-down on states’ efforts to stem the flow of illegal migrants. It sued Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in December for using stacked shipping containers to fill gaps in its border, especially around high-traffic crossings like Yuma.

In Monday’s press briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that illegal immigration decreased since Title 42 — a temporary measure implemented in 2020 to stop the spread of COVID-1 — was repealed in May, showing the White House immigration plan was working.

Jean-Pierre is likely referring to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistic showing the total encounters between agents and migrants at the Southwest land border in fiscal year 2023 are trending lower than encounters in 2020 and 2021. However, this statistic includes Title 42 expulsions which allowed CBP agents expanded authority to stop some legal immigrants from entering the country. It makes sense that total encounters would be down in 2023 compared to the last two years because CBP agents are no longer rejecting immigrants on Title 42 grounds.

To measure illegal immigration, the CBP measures the number of migrants apprehended under Title 8 — our normal immigration laws. This statistic reveals that illegal immigration is up 28.5% from fiscal year 2019.

As the Daily Citizen has previously reported, illegal immigration is brutally injurious to families and children. The International Labor Organization states that illegal migrants and children are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking — including forced labor, sex trafficking and forced marriage — because they do not feel they can turn to law enforcement for help. Of the estimated 49.6 million people being trafficked on any given day, a disproportionate amount are migrants and 12.3 million are children.

This year, CBP agents have encountered 98,649 unaccompanied minors at the Southwestern border — an almost 80% increase from 2020. By some government estimates, as many as 80% of these children are victims of trafficking. An untold number of victimized migrants and children have tried to enter America as part of one of the 428,500 family units encountered by CPB agents in 2023, an 86% increase from 2020.

Illegal immigration also harms the families left behind. Illegal migrants face innumerable social and environmental dangers on their journey north, including severe heat, risk of drowning, dehydration and violence from human smugglers. In addition to the trauma suffered by families who lose loved ones, smugglers have been known to torture single migrants to extort money from their families. A form of trafficking, the ripple effects of “debt bondage” affects families hundreds of miles away from the border.

Some, including the Human Trafficking Institute, argue that high rates of injury and trafficking among illegal immigrants at the Southwest border should encourage America to adopt more lenient immigration policies. Critics like the Heritage Foundation, on the other hand, argue lax policies and enforcement have led to a spike in illegal immigration by incentivizing the dangerous journey.

Though we may quibble over policy specifics, two facts are clear: Illegal immigration is harmful and it’s on the rise. As citizens and members of the body of Christ, we should pray for the safety of those that attempt to enter the country illegally and vote to ensure our policies do not inadvertently incentivize such an injurious practice.

Make no mistake: Illegal immigration harms everyone involved, and it shouldn’t be tolerated.

Jul 25 2023,Federal judge says Biden administration's new immigration policy is 'invalid',HotAir,right,https://hotair.com/john-s-2/2023/07/25/federal-judge-says-biden-administrations-new-immigration-policy-is-invalid-n567135,"As I explained here, the Biden administration recently adopted a new immigration policy which limited asylum claims from people who cross the border illegally and who can’t show they filed for asylum in any other countries along the route to the US border. That policy that far fewer migrants were able to gain entry to the Untied States by claiming asylum after crossing the border illegally.

The number of single-adult migrants who are able to pass initial screenings at the border has dropped from 83% to 46% under the new policy, the Biden administration said in the court filing. The 83% rate refers to initial asylum screenings between 2014 and 2019; the new data cover the period from May 12, the first full day the new policy was in place, through June 13.

This was a much needed change after the expiration of Title 42 and gave the border patrol some ability to send people home rather than simply welcome then in for the seven year process of seeing an immigration judge, a process that all but ensures they’ll be allowed to stay in the US regardless of what the immigration court ultimately decides.

Today a federal judge in northern California ruled that the Biden administration’s immigration policy is invalid, though he gave the administration two weeks to appeal.

The Biden administration was dealt a major blow in its efforts to control the ongoing border crisis on Tuesday when a federal judge blocked a rule introduced in May that makes migrants ineligible for asylum if they have entered illegally and failed to take advantage of expanded lawful pathways set up by the federal government. Judge Jon Tigar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California blocked the Circumvention of Lawful Pathways rule in response to a lawsuit from a coalition of left-wing immigration groups, which claimed the rule was similar to a Trump-era transit ban that was similarly blocked. He found the rule is “both substantively and procedurally invalid” and has delayed his ruling from taking effect for 14 days to give the administration time to appeal… The rule had angered left-wing immigration activist groups, which said it was cruel and limited the ability of foreign nationals to claim asylum in the U.S. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which led the groups in the lawsuit, hailed the ruling on Tuesday. “The ruling is a victory, but each day the Biden administration prolongs the fight over its illegal ban, many people fleeing persecution and seeking safe harbor for their families are instead left in grave danger,” said Katrina Eiland, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, in a statement. “The promise of America is to serve as a beacon of freedom and hope, and the administration can and should do better to fulfill this promise, rather than perpetuate cruel and ineffective policies that betray it.”

The ACLU wants the border to be effectively wide open regardless of the level of chaos that creates for the border patrol and the border states who are mostly left trying to deal with this. So what happens next? The administration will appeal and it’s likely the stay will continue until the appeals court reaches a decision. Then, if they affirm the lower court, it could be appealed to SCOTUS.

I’m not getting my hopes up that either court will reverse this decision for two reasons. First, because this will now go to the Ninth Circuit and second because it’s entirely possible that the judge is simply right on the law. Our asylum system has been broken for years at this point. Biden’s ability to change that on the fly is probably no greater than his ability to eliminate student debt because he feels like it.

By law, foreigners who reach U.S. soil are entitled to request asylum, regardless of how they entered the country… “The court concludes that the rule is contrary to law because it presumes ineligible for asylum noncitizens who enter between ports of entry, using a manner of entry that Congress expressly intended should not affect access to asylum,” the judge wrote.

The fact remains that the border is under siege and we need some way to control that chaos. Biden’s plan was to block a large number of asylum seekers with this new rule and simultaneously open the floodgates to tens of thousands of migrants per month who wait in line using an app. As I pointed out here, this didn’t really change the number of people coming to the border by much but it did reduce the level of chaos substantially. It worked because it created a powerful incentive for order. Cross the border without an appointment and you were probably going home. Stay in line and you had a good shot at getting in.

Now it looks like we might be headed right back to chaos.

Remember, just before the end of Title 42 we were seeing more than 10,000 migrants a day cross the border. That’s just not sustainable. And thanks to the busing done by Gov. Abbott, you can bet that New York, Chicago and LA are worried about what will happen next. That’s a good thing because it means the whole country has a stake in this.

In addition to being a potentially huge problem for the country it’s also a big problem for presidential candidate Joe Biden. The ACLU may be celebrating now but they probably just put an anchor around Biden’s neck for 2024.

A migrant surge could open up President Biden to attacks from Republicans, as campaigning gets underway for the presidential election next year. This policy, in particular, does not diverge greatly from the one introduced by President Donald J. Trump, according to legal experts. The strategy of returning to the same judge who found the Trump administration’s rule unlawful paid off for immigrant advocates, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group.

At some point what we need is for congress to fix the broken asylum system so that every migrant willing to lie to the border patrol isn’t eligible for a lengthy stay, but neither side wants to do take on immigration with a divided congress because neither side is willing to compromise."

Jun 25 2023,Supreme Court Rejects Free Speech Challenge to Immigration Law,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/us/scotus-free-speech-immigration.html,"The Supreme Court avoided a difficult First Amendment question on Friday, ruling that an unusual 1986 federal law that makes it a crime to “encourage” or “induce” unauthorized immigrants to come to or stay in the United States should be read narrowly to require complicity in a criminal conduct.

A broader interpretation of the law would give rise to constitutional concerns, Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority in the 7-to-2 decision. She added that the law’s key words were terms of art used in a “specialized, criminal-law sense” and mean something different than they do in ordinary usage. For purposes of the law, she wrote, the terms require proof of solicitation or facilitation of a crime.

When the case was argued in March, several justices asked questions about the law’s sweep, given the usual meaning of “encourage.”

Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked about a grandmother living in the United States without authorization. “The grandmother tells her son she’s worried about the burden she’s putting on the family,” the justice said. “And the son says: ‘Abuelita, you are never a burden to us. If you want to continue living here with us, your grandchildren love having you.’”"
May 17 2023,Truckers threaten to boycott Florida over immigration law,NewsNation,center,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/immigration/truckers-threaten-to-boycott-florida-over-immigration-law/,"MIAMI (NewsNation) — Truck drivers have called for boycotts against Florida’s new penalties and restrictions on undocumented immigrants in the state that require employers to verify if workers are authorized to work in the U.S.

Across social media platforms, Latino truck drivers are now threatening to stop delivering to and from Florida and are calling on migrants to stand down from work for up to a week.

Drivers posted videos on TikTok with messages like “don’t enter Florida,” and encouraging others to follow their lead, which has led to a thread of truck drivers saying they were not driving through the state.

Drivers have said they plan to boycott Florida by not driving in the state beginning as early as next month. The hashtags #noFlorida and #boycottFlorida are spreading.

Senate Bill 1718 aims to limit the flow of illegal immigration. Under the new law, businesses with more than 25 employees are required to use E-verify, the federal system that allows enrolled employers to determine if their employees are legally authorized to work in the U.S.

The new immigration law also requires employers to fire an employee if they discover that employee to be a “foreign national” who is not authorized to work in the country. The law also invalidates out-of-state identification cards issued to “unauthorized immigrants.”

“It shows solidarity, it cuts off the supply chain to Florida, A. B, it’s also a statement of solidarity with their fellow countrymen, who don’t see that status as an issue when they’re here,” said Allen Orr, the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

Immigrant advocates said Florida’s approach is targeting a community already struggling to survive. According to the Migration Policy Institute, 21% of people living in Florida weren’t born in the U.S.

“Generally speaking, an employer is not going to let the drivers dictate the company business and they wouldn’t be terminated,” said Joe Rajkovacz, the director of governmental affairs for the Western State Trucking Association.

The law doesn’t apply to independent contractors.

Meanwhile, advocates are pointing to the ripple effect this could cause. They’ve posted videos on social media of empty grocery store shelves, implying that the threat from Latin American truck drivers will further impact the state’s economy.

Florida’s new law, which was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis on May 10, will take effect on July 1.

The new law comes at the end of Title 42, which was lifted on May 11. Title 42 was enacted under the Trump administration and allowed border authorities to immediately turn away migrants encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border."
Jul 17 2023,Advocacy groups sue Florida officials over latest immigration law,WLNS,center,https://wlns.com/hill-politics/advocacy-groups-sue-florida-officials-over-latest-immigration-law,"A coalition of advocacy groups sued an array of Florida officials Monday, claiming that the state’s new prohibitions on transporting undocumented immigrants “could sweep in all manner of immigrants.”

The lawsuit specifically targets Section 10 of the new bill, which makes it a felony to transport into Florida a foreign national who “entered the United States in violation of law and has not been inspected by the Federal Government since his or her unlawful entry from another country.”

“Criminalizing transportation without federal ‘inspection’ and subjecting individuals to vague definitions is both unconstitutional and unfair,” said Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council (AIC), one of the groups who filed the suit.

“This ill-advised legislation not only singles out immigrants and their families but also poses a threat to the social and economic well-being of Florida’s communities,” added Melloy Goettel.

The Florida law, which went into effect July 1, also includes provisions to expand the use of E-Verify, a controversial federal program to check employees’ immigration status; ban the use of certain out-of-state drivers’ licenses granted to undocumented immigrants; and require hospitals to collect information on patients’ immigration status.

But the lawsuit filed Monday focuses on the transportation chapter of the law, calling it “hopelessly vague and incoherent, because Floridians and travelers into Florida have no way to know which people fall within its terms.”

According to the plaintiffs, the law’s language does not match up with federal immigration statutes, leading to confusion about who the bill would consider to have been “inspected” for immigration purposes.

The law doesn’t distinguish between undocumented immigrants, asylum seekers, immigration parolees or any other immigration status that could apply to people who initially entered the country without prior authorization.

AIC, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ACLU of Florida, Americans for Immigrant Justice filed the suit on behalf of the Farmworker Association of Florida and nine unnamed plaintiffs who say they would face criminal charges under the law.

The plaintiffs range from U.S. citizens who provide transportation to immigrants for humanitarian or health reasons to a married couple of undocumented farmworkers who work seasonally in Florida and other states.

“Each year, to maximize the seasons that they work, they usually spend about six months of the year working in Florida and six months of the year working out of state. They travel together across states. This year, however, they did not leave Florida to work out-of-state because they were frightened that if they left Florida, they would not be able to return, due to Section 10,” reads the lawsuit.

“Not only is this law detrimental to our members’ abilities to put food on their own tables, it is detrimental to our members’ ability to put food on everyone’s tables,” said Nezahualcoyotl Xiuhtecutli, general coordinator of the Farmworker Association of Florida.

The complaint names as defendants Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Attorney General Ashley Moody (R), Statewide Prosecutor Nicholas Cox, and the 20 Florida state attorneys.

Jeremy Redfern, the press secretary for DeSantis’s executive office, lashed out at the ACLU over the lawsuit and defended the law as a protection against human smuggling.

“The ACLU has for years drifted increasingly leftward and out of the American mainstream. Long are the days when the ACLU defended actual civil liberties, such as free speech and religious rights. But taking the side of human smugglers–something truly outrageous and abhorrent–wasn’t on our bingo card,” said Redfern in an email to The Hill.

“Nevertheless, in Florida, we will continue to fight illegal immigration and the evil predations of human smuggling. We look forward to defending Florida and its humane laws against attacks by the ACLU and its leftist cronies.”

DeSantis has made immigration a linchpin of his presidential campaign, seeking to present a more hawkish vision than former President Trump, the leading candidate for the GOP nomination.

One plaintiff identified as M.M. — a mother of five, including four U.S. citizens — who overstayed her visa and is seeking relief in immigration court, said she joined the suit “because this law harms our family and many others.”

“We aren’t doing anything to hurt anyone. On the contrary, we’re here working, paying taxes and trying to provide a safe life for our families. Now we’re scared to even travel together as a family. I would never want my son to face a felony for traveling with his mother and his sister. It makes no sense. We’re family — how can this be?” said M.M. in a statement.

Jun 23 2023,Supreme Court upholds Joe Biden’s immigration enforcement plan,Bangor Daily News,left,https://bangordailynews.com/2023/06/23/news/nation/supreme-court-upholds-immigration-plan,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a key part of President Joe Biden’s plan for targeted immigration enforcement, ruling the administration may focus its efforts on arresting and deporting those who pose a current danger.

In a 8-1 decision, the justices said Texas and Louisiana lacked standing to sue in order to require a more aggressive federal policy of arrests.

Writing for the court, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh invoked the conservative principle that judges should not make government policy through politically driven lawsuits. Moreover, enforcing the immigration laws has been understood to be the job of the executive branch, not the courts, he said.

“The states essentially want the federal judiciary to order the executive branch to alter its arrest policy so as to make more arrests,” he said in United States v. Texas. But the states and their attorneys have not suffered a personal injury that would give them standing to sue, he said.

“If the court green-lighted this suit,” federal judges would soon be asked to decide whether the government must make more arrests to enforce the drug laws, gun laws and many others, he said.

The decision tossed out a lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton before a conservative judge in Corpus Christi, Texas. U.S. District Judge Drew Tipton, a Trump appointee, issued a nationwide order declaring the Biden administration’s immigration policy was illegal and could not be used.

The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to lift the order in July of last year, and the Supreme Court did the same by turning down an emergency appeal filed by Biden’s lawyers.

But after hearing arguments in the case, all but Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. voted to toss out the lawsuit and allow the administration to proceed as planned.

Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott tweeted that “this decision is outrageous. SCOTUS gives the Biden Admin. carte blanche to avoid accountability for abandoning enforcement of immigration laws. Texas will continue to deploy the National Guard to repel & turn back illegal immigrants trying to enter Texas illegally.”

But David Leopold, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, called the decision “a victory for common sense over chaos and a blow against Republicans’ reliance on the anti-immigrant judicial pipeline. We hope today’s ruling is a signal that on immigration, judges should follow the law and not impose their own politics.”

Friday’s opinion is the fourth in recent weeks to sound the theme of judicial restraint and deference to Congress or the White House.

With Kavanaugh casting the key vote, the justices earlier this month upheld a provision of the Voting Rights Act in an Alabama case, ruling that Congress required states to try to draw compact election districts that give Black voters a chance to elect a candidate of their choice.

Last week, they upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act that seeks to keep Native American children with relatives or tribal members. Justices Clarence Thomas and Alito dissented in both cases and said they would have overturned those laws.

On Thursday, the justices tossed out a lawsuit brought by Navajo Nation seeking more water rights and ruled the issue is one for Congress, not the courts.

But that trend may not last. Next week, the justices are due to hand down the final decisions of this term. They include challenges to college affirmative action policies and to Biden’s plan to forgive millions of student loans.

The immigration case decided Friday does not involve the tens of thousands of migrants who arrive at the border or the millions of those who live in the country without legal documentation.

Instead, it concerned immigrants with past crimes on their records and whether the government is required to seek them out for arrest and deportation.

Republican state attorneys and the Democratic administration have been locked in a dispute over immigration enforcement. Last year, the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote refused to allow Biden’s immigration enforcement guidelines to take effect, but the justices agreed to hear arguments on the legal dispute.

At issue was whether the law requires mandatory detention for immigrants who have a serious crime on their record or instead allows the administration to focus on arresting and deporting those who pose a current danger to public safety.

Often, immigrants serve years in state prisons for crimes such as drug trafficking. Upon release, they may be taken into custody by federal immigration agents, but that is not automatic.

Biden’s Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas said the government had no choice but to set priorities for enforcing the immigration laws. He said the government did not have the staff or the space to seek out and arrest tens of thousands of non-citizens for past crimes.

“It is well-established in the law that federal government officials have broad discretion to decide who should be subject to arrest, detainers, removal proceedings and the execution of removal orders,” he said last September. He said enforcement should focus on “noncitizens who pose a current threat to public safety,” not all those who have a criminal record.

Jun 24 2023,A Supreme Court decision cleared the way for Biden's immigration policy,NPR Fact Check,left,https://npr.org/2023/06/24/1184152206/a-supreme-court-decision-cleared-the-way-for-bidens-immigration-policy,"A Supreme Court decision cleared the way for Biden's immigration policy

MILES PARKS, HOST:

The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday cleared the way for the Biden administration to reinstate its strategy on immigration enforcement. That enforcement strategy had been blocked after a legal challenge by the states of Texas and Louisiana. Yesterday's high court ruling could have broader implications for other immigration cases as well. NPR's Joel Rose covers immigration, and he joins us now for more. Hi, Joel.

JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Hey, Miles.

PARKS: So tell us a little bit more about this case. What was at stake?

ROSE: Yeah, this is a closely watched case because what's at stake is really how much authority the Biden administration, or any administration, has to set immigration policy. It's widely agreed that there are not enough resources for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to simply arrest everyone who is in the country without authorization. So the Biden administration said, we want to use our prosecutorial discretion to set priorities, to focus on suspected terrorists and threats to public safety and on recent border crossers.

And crucially, under this guidance, simply being present in the U.S. without authorization is generally not a reason to detain someone. These priorities were quickly challenged in court by the states of Texas and Louisiana, and they argued that the guidelines go far beyond the priorities of past administrations and are basically preventing immigration authorities from doing their jobs. The lower court agreed and blocked this guidance last year.

PARKS: OK. So what did the Supreme Court decide?

ROSE: The court ruled that Texas and Louisiana lacked the standing to challenge these guidelines in the first place because the states had not shown a direct injury from these enforcement priorities, at least not one that could be redressed by the courts. The vote was 8-1. Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court's liberals. There were several concurring opinions from the other conservatives that reach roughly the same conclusion, but by slightly different legal rationales. Only Justice Samuel Alito dissented, finding that Texas and Louisiana should have been able to sue in this case.

PARKS: This feels like a pretty big win for the Biden administration. Is that right?

ROSE: It's definitely a win in the short run because the Biden administration can officially begin enforcing these priorities again. In the long run, I think it's harder to say. In the majority opinion, Justice Kavanaugh writes several times about how narrow this decision is, that the court decided the standing questions on the facts that were before it in this case, but that there might be another case where the states would have standing to sue. So some legal analysts are saying, do not read too much into this ruling, including Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches law at Cornell University.

STEPHEN YALE-LOEHR: The court's decision was pretty narrow. From a larger legal perspective, it doesn't really resolve the issue of when states can and cannot sue to challenge federal policies whether they're immigration or otherwise. And so the battle will continue on those fronts.

PARKS: Well, and the Biden administration has been sued a number of times by Texas and other states over its immigration policies. What does this ruling mean for - in those other instances?

ROSE: That's really the big question. I mean, we're talking about cases with a lot at stake. There's a case about the future, for example, of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, you know, that is likely heading for the Supreme Court. DACA, by the way, protects immigrants who are brought to the U.S. as children. So this decision on standing could be a big deal. Certainly, it's going to give the Biden administration and immigrant advocates fresh ammunition to argue that states that are challenging these policies should not get standing in those cases either.

What we really don't know is how well that argument is going to work - right? - I mean, how much weight lower court judges will decide to give this Supreme Court ruling. I think the bottom line is that there's going to be more litigation. You know, this is the second time in two years that the Supreme Court has sided with the Biden administration against states in these big immigration cases. But that ruling last year did not stop states from challenging immigration policies in court. I don't think this one is likely to do that either.

PARKS: That's NPR's Joel Rose.

Thank you so much for monitoring this, Joel.

ROSE: You're welcome.

Jun 25 2019,Immigration,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration,"Some point out that “The government’s ‘safe and sanitary’ argument did not arise from a new case generated by Trump-administration policies. It arose in 1985, during the Reagan administration, when a 15-year-old Salvadoran child named Jenny Lisette Flores was detained after entering the United States illegally, hoping to escape her country’s vicious civil war. Flores spent two months at a facility in California, confined with adult strangers in poor conditions and strip-searched regularly… “It is right and fit to condemn the Trump administration for its argument and its treatment of children. But… this administration is merely the latest one to subject immigrant children to abusive conditions. It’s been 35 years since Jenny Flores was strip-searched in an adult facility. Before Sarah Fabian defended concrete floors and bright lights for President Donald Trump, she defended putting kids in solitary confinement for President Barack Obama… This stain on America’s soul will not wash out with an election cycle .” Ken White, The Atlantic

“US Border Patrol is holding many children, including some who are much too young to take care of themselves, in jail-like border facilities for weeks at a time without contact with family members, regular access to showers, clean clothes, toothbrushes, or proper beds. Many are sick. Many, including children as young as 2 or 3, have been separated from adult caretakers without any provisions for their care… The Trump administration wants more money to build more child detention centers to hold even more children… But that ask glosses over the fact that more children are in immigration custody because over the last several years the government has slowed down the rate at which children are reunified with their families… “Based on our interviews, officials at the border seem to be making no effort to release children to caregivers -- many have parents in the US -- rather than holding them for weeks in overcrowded cells at the border… Congress should take action -- not by approving more money for detention -- but by requiring immigration agencies to cease separating children from family members unless that's in the interest of the child, release and reunify children as soon as possible and cease using them as bait to arrest family members.” Clara Long and Nicole Austin-Hillery, CNN

Regarding migrant detention centers, “Trump essentially dismissed the plight of migrant children while speaking with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press. ‘This has been happening long before I got there,’ the president said when pressed about the conditions. ‘We’ve ended [family] separation. Under President Obama, you had separation. I was the one who ended it.’ ‘We’re doing a fantastic job, under the circumstances,’ he added. None of this is true . Families attempting to cross the border under President Obama were separated only in rare circumstances, such as when there was concern for the safety of the child, or when the adult could not be confirmed to be the child’s parent… “Though Trump signed an executive order to suspend his own administration’s zero-tolerance policy, children are still being separated from their parents if authorities deem the parent poses a risk to the child. Such separations are on the rise, often for reasons as petty as the parent having a traffic violation on their record.” Ryan Bort, Rolling Stone

“Undocumented or not, rousing a family out of bed at 6 a.m. to abruptly end their lives in the U.S. seems heartless. We don’t do that in America, or at least we shouldn’t… Before we’re called naive, we are not saying that undocumented criminal immigrants shouldn’t be removed. They are a public menace and should be deported. Yes, go after criminals. And yes, people should not have overstayed their tourist visas, which a fair amount of the undocumented have done. But the round up is a Gestapo tactic unworthy of us … Let’s hope [Trump’s] correction is a return to some sanity and a show of compassion.” Editorial Board, Miami Herald

From the Right

The right supports increased deportations, and highlights that many of the issues involving the treatment of migrants in custody existed under the previous administration and will require a bipartisan solution.

The right supports increased deportations, and highlights that many of the issues involving the treatment of migrants in custody existed under the previous administration and will require a bipartisan solution.

“The fact of the matter is that we’re discussing individuals (and families) who have already had the opportunity to make their case in court, have had their status determined and been issued orders of deportation. Rather than following those orders, they knowingly chose to remain in the country illegally and have been legally subject to arrest and deportation ever since.”

Jazz Shaw, Hot Air

“Remember the great government shutdown that Trump was ‘proud’ to own after he couldn’t get Democrats to give him money to build more wall? He caved on that. Remember when his Justice Department took a ‘zero tolerance’ position on illegal border crossings? He caved on that, too. And now he’s caving on deportations, the least controversial part of immigration enforcement. Trump won the argument on immigration. But when it comes to actually getting anything done he's a lot like a normal politician. All talk, no action.”

Eddie Scarry, The Washington Examiner

Regarding migrant detention centers, “the vast majority of the people and the outlets that shared [the] exchange [about toothbrushes and soap] failed to note that the violations being discussed had occurred during the previous administration… Instead, they jumped straight to the conclusion that the federal government, headed up by President Trump, was deliberately inflicting pain on babies. This isn’t true. It wasn’t true during the Obama administration either. Then, as now, the violations weren’t part of an intentional or evil ploy, but were the product of the system’s being overloaded… Certainly, some facilities have taken shortcuts, as the result of either bureaucratic incompetence or limited resources. But those infractions will be fixed by additional funding, additional facilities, better oversight, and quicker processing, not by pretending that the president is a tyrant.”

A.G. Hamilton, National Review

“This is a bipartisan problem and it started under a previous administration. The name game and blame game suggests partisans are not really interested in a solution so long as they can inflame people over the issue. But this needs to be fixed… The President should allow in charitable relief immediately. Democrats and Republicans should pass expanded funding to improve the detention facilities within the week. And then we really should secure the border. The situation has gotten worse because of a flood of people seeking asylum. Even the New York Times is willing to recognize there is a crisis now at the border.”

Erick Erickson, The Resurgent

Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) writes, “The root cause of the record-breaking surge in migrants is the widespread abuse of our asylum system. Because of a massive backlog of asylum cases and an inability to quickly adjudicate and enforce them, more migrants are making the journey to our border. They bring children with them to take advantage of our loopholes, knowing we must release family units within 20 days… As it stands now, the incentives are aligned to permit illegal immigrants to cross the border with a child, knowing full well that they will be caught and released into society without the chance of deportation.”

Jul 14 2023,Immigration Expert Reveals Why Latest Border Numbers Are ‘Deceitful’,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/immigration-expert-reveals-why-latest-border-numbers-are-deceitful,"Reported immigration numbers suggesting that illegal immigration at the U.S. southern border plummeted to the lowest level in over two years in June are misleading, according to a former Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official.

Border Patrol agents recorded roughly 100,000 apprehensions of illegal immigrants between ports of entry along the U.S. southern border during the month of June, CBS News reported this week. That total is a steep drop from the roughly 169,000 apprehensions recorded the month prior in May.

That drop-off is largely due to lax parole policies that encourage immigrants to walk through ports of entry, rather than between the ports, according to Lora Ries, director of the Border Security and Immigration Center at The Heritage Foundation. The number also does not take into account known and unknown gotaways that get past border security into the interior of the U.S. without arrest.

The reported numbers “are deceitful. The number of illegal and inadmissible aliens coming into the country is still just as high, but the administration is using a shell game and sending people through ports of entry instead of between ports of entry, and then declaring that an improvement on the border,” Ries, a former acting deputy chief of staff at DHS, told The Daily Wire.

“We know the numbers are about the same because when you look at nationwide CBP encounters, which includes numbers at the ports of entry, that number has steadily risen,” she said.

The numbers reported by CBS News are preliminary and have not yet been officially released to the public. Current numbers available on the DHS website show the number of immigrants processed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Field Operations, which handles processing of migrants at ports of entry, has steadily risen over the course of Biden’s term.

The preliminary Border Patrol numbers reported by CBS News do not include immigrants that appear at the ports of entry and are processed through the Office of Field Operations.

The Biden administration has touted the use of stiffer immigration rules as well as parole programs that accept tens of thousands of immigrants from certain countries to ease approval to enter the United States. That various parole pathways are the main drivers of the change in the Biden administration’s counting of illegal immigration, according to Ries.

The port parole programs have been steadily accepting more immigrants, driving immigrants to ports of entry rather than attempting to cross between ports.

“They’ve been increasing the daily number of appointments CBP takes at the ports,” Ries said. “They’re about to increase it again. And when you do the math of those programs and add those back to the numbers of people crossing between the courts, you’re still at around 200,000 encounters a month, and that’s the number that the administration simply doesn’t want out there.”"
Jun 16 2023,Jeff Sessions: Americans Can Rebuild a Positive Immigration System,Breitbart News,right,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/06/16/jeff-sessions-americans-can-rebuild-positive-immigration-system/,"Ordinary Americans can establish a positive immigration system that rebuilds needed prosperity, a memo from former President Donald Trump’s earliest 2016 election supporter said.

With a positive “vision of what all Americans will gain from an immigration system that works … we will win,” former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions wrote in a memo on June 16 for the American Compass think tank:

Our vision for immigration should focus on ensuring that American workers are protected, especially the most marginal ones whom employers would rather ignore: ex-convicts, recovering addicts, the handicapped and developmentally disabled, even teenagers and single mothers who might require accommodations that employers would rather not make. … How can an American afford to raise a family while competing with an unlimited flow of workers desperate to work for any wage? The brutal fact is that businesses will always lust for cheap labor and see families as none of their concern; economists are happy so long as there are more people to buy more colas, thus boosting GDP. A positive immigration policy would use firm enforcement to admit highly skilled people who can deliver significant economic gains, while restricting the admission of less-skilled people who are more likely to earn low wages in our market and need to rely on taxpayers for support—not because of any moral shortcoming on their part, but because that’s the economic reality that we face. Everyone knows that wealth disparity is a crucial concern for our society. In a tight labor market with low immigration and strict enforcement, the market power of marginalized workers increases. With so many low-wage Americans struggling already, an immigration policy that gives them power to demand better wages simply makes sense, while one that weakens their position while adding yet more people in an even weaker position does not.

The current exploitative immigration system is deeply unpopular, Sessions noted: “The progressive preference for open borders, strongly supported by a corporate lobby eager for cheap labor, is deeply unpopular with the American people and efforts to promote amnesty have been repeatedly rejected.”

Read it all here.

Some Republican leaders are trying to create a positive immigration policy that benefits both business donors and ordinary Americans.

They include Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fl) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has even signed an E-Verify law that is helping Americans’ pocketbooks by pressuring illegals to leave the state.

DeSantis declared on May 10:

Nobody has a right to immigrate to this country. We determine as Americans what type of immigration system benefits our country, but when you’re doing immigration, it’s not for their benefit as foreigners, it’s for your benefit as Americans. So if there’s legal immigration that’s harming Americans, we shouldn’t do that either. For example, some of these H-1B visas, they would fire American tech workers and hire foreigners at lower wages. I don’t agree with that. I think that’s wrong.

Similarly, in a June 9 message, Sen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) urged his farming community to make more use of labor-saving, productivity-boosting, cow-milking robots: “I’m highlighting Ohlde Family Farms located in North Central Kansas … They’re addressing workforce shortages by adopting an all-robot [cow milking] parlor. Yes, you read that right- ALL ROBOT PARLOR.”

So far, however, the GOP’s priorities are set by wealthy coastal investors and many ordinary business groups who gain from the government-delivered inflow of government-funded consumers, lower-skill workers, and apartment-sharing renters.

For example, Michigan-based WoodTV.com reported on June 15:

Nate Koetje, the CEO of Feyen Zylstra electrical services, said economic growth is dependent on a growing population. He said the supply of people available to work is shrinking while the number of jobs continues to grow. “We’re working to provide leadership in the business community on attracting new Americans to West Michigan,” he said. “As part of that solution, we want to inspire both the business community and policy makers to look at immigration as a force for good and something that our community needs to embrace in order to continue to build on the successes we’ve had in the past.”

President Joe Biden and his border chief, Alejandro Mayorkas, want to import more poor, diverse migrants for economic and “equity” reasons amid abundant evidence of the huge pocketbook and civic damage caused to blue-collar and white-collar Americans and their communities."
Mar 24 2023,"US, Canada close immigration border loophole",East Bay Times,left,https://eastbaytimes.com/2023/03/24/us-canada-close-immigration-border-loophole,"By Wilson Ring | Associated Press

ST. JOHNSBURY, Vermont — U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday announced a plan to close a loophole to an immigration agreement that has allowed thousands of asylum-seeking immigrants to move between the two countries along a back road linking New York state to the Canadian province of Quebec.

So many migrants since early 2017 have walked into Canada on Roxham Road outside Champlain, New York, that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police staffed a reception center to process them, less than five miles from the official border crossing.

Mounties have warned the migrants at the end of a narrow two-lane road bordered by forests and farm fields that they would be arrested if they crossed the border. But once on Canadian soil, they have been allowed to stay and pursue asylum cases that can take years to resolve.

The new policy says that asylum seekers without U.S. or Canadian citizenship who are caught within 14 days of crossing anywhere along the 3,145-mile border will be sent back. That includes people walking on Roxham Road.

The deal was set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Saturday — a quick implementation aimed at avoiding a surge of refugee claimants trying to cross, according to Canadian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the deal in advance.

Some of the last migrants to make it through before the Biden-Trudeau announcement were about eight people in two families — one from Haiti, the other from Afghanistan — who arrived at the U.S. end of Roxham Road just after dawn on Friday. Both said they took circuitous routes to get there.

Gerson Solay, 28, carried his daughter Bianca up to the border. He said he didn’t have the proper documents to remain in the United States. “That is why Canada is my last destination,” he said before he was taken into custody for processing.

It’s unclear how Roxham Road became a favorite route, but it’s just a taxi ride from where Interstate 87 approaches the Canadian border, and for southbound migrants, it’s a relatively short distance to New York City.

These migrants have taken advantage of a quirk in a 2002 agreement between the U.S. and Canada that says asylum seekers must apply in the first country they arrive in. Migrants who go to an official Canadian crossing are returned to the U.S. and told to apply there. But those who reach Canadian soil somewhere other than a port of entry — like the center near Roxham Road — are allowed to stay and request protection.

The agreement was immediately criticized by some who feel it could endanger the safety of asylum seekers by preventing them from getting needed support from both governments.

“We urge President Biden to strongly reconsider this deal and to work with Congress to restore access to asylum and support policies that recognize the dignity of all those arriving at our borders,” said Danilo Zak, associate director for policy and advocacy for the humanitarian group CWS, also known as Church World Services. The organization advocates for people across the world who have been forced from their homes.

The agreement comes as the U.S. Border Patrol responds to a steep increase in illegal southbound crossings along the wide-open Canadian border. Nearly all happen in northern New York and Vermont along the stretch of border nearest Canada’s two largest cities, Toronto and Montreal.

While the numbers are still tiny compared to the U.S.-Mexico border, it’s happening so frequently now that the Border Patrol increased its staffing in the region and has begun releasing some migrants into Vermont with a future date to appear before immigration authorities.

As part of the deal, Canada also agreed to allow 15,000 migrants from the Western Hemisphere to seek asylum on a humanitarian basis over the course of the year.

Meanwhile, southbound migrants are straining U.S. border officials.

U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped migrants entering illegally from Canada 628 times in February, more than five times the same period a year earlier. Those numbers pale compared to migrants entering from Mexico – where they were stopped more than 220,000 times in December alone — but it is still a massive change in percentage terms.

In the Border Patrol’s Swanton Sector, which stretches across New Hampshire, Vermont and a portion of upstate New York, agents stopped migrants 418 times in February, up more than 10 times from a year earlier. About half entering from Canada have been Mexicans, who can fly visa-free to Canada from Mexico.

About an hour south of the border, the police chief in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, population 6,000, alerted state officials that the Border Patrol had dropped off a vanload of immigrants with just a few minutes notice at the community’s welcome center. The same thing happened several times before within the last few weeks.

In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the migrants dropped off in St. Johnsbury had been apprehended along the border after entering the U.S. without authorization, and were given a notice to appear for later immigration proceedings.

They were dropped off in St. Johnsbury because it has a station where migrants can take a bus to a larger city.

“In such circumstances, USBP works in tandem with local communities to ensure the safety of all parties—both community members and migrants—and to ensure stability in the community’s resources,” the statement said.

But local officials said they weren’t given time to prepare. State officials are now working to set up a system to provide migrants services they might require.

On Thursday, a Haitian couple and their children, boys aged 17 and 9 and a 15-year-old girl, were dropped off at the welcome center. The family, who did not want to give their names, wanted to take a bus to Miami.

They said they’d been in Canada for two months, but wouldn’t talk about what prompted them to keep moving.

Jan 06 2023,Joe Biden Is a Complete Liar on Immigration,Daily Beast,left,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-is-a-complete-liar-on-immigration?ref=home,"President Joe Biden did a wicked thing this week, and he probably figured that he could hide it behind the smoke from the implosion of the Republican Party at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.

With the American people distracted by the efforts by 20 Republican insurgents to deny the speaker’s gavel to Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), this was an opportune time for the White House to unveil a crackdown on the U.S.-Mexico border that would make any GOP immigration hardliner proud.

McCarthy is in trouble with fellow Republicans who find the 57-year-old from Central California unlikable, uninspiring, and untrustworthy. And at the same time, Biden is showing everyone that he can be all those things when it comes to cracking down on immigrants and refugees.

All Biden had to do was betray and backtrack. He was able to con the Latinos who voted for him, because they were desperate to be rescued from the regime of former President Donald Trump. Biden said often on the stump that, if elected president, his administration’s immigration system would be “safe, orderly, and humane.”

But the immigration plan that the president announced this week—which appears to have been sketched out by the Department of Homeland Security—is none of those things. Instead, the measures are arbitrary, cruel, and racist.

The two code words of the Biden plan are “expand” and “expedite.” The idea is to expand the president’s power to expedite the removal of migrants and refugees deemed undesirable.

Biden made plain that how a migrant or refugee is treated by U.S. immigration policy will be determined not by personal circumstances, or the merit of their asylum claim, but by the country they come from—and by extension the color of their skin.

Under the Biden plan, if you arrive from Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela or Haiti, your chances of even getting before an immigration judge to plead your case for asylum have just been severely limited. A total of 30,000 visas per month will be allotted per country, but those who want to receive them—and be “paroled” into the United States—will need to be vetted and get the blessing of a U.S. sponsor. Anyone from those countries who tries to enter the United States once the allotment is exhausted is out of luck. They will be immediately deported to Mexico without so much as a hearing.

It’s all part of the administration’s efforts to expand Title 42. That’s the provision of the U.S. code created by a 1944 public health law that Trump invoked during the COVID-19 pandemic to severely curtail migrant border crossings. Biden promised to end Title 42 while campaigning for president. Once elected, he changed his mind and kept it for nearly two years until a federal judge struck it down. Last month, the Supreme Court ordered that Title 42 remain in place.

Notice that none of the people threatened with expedited removal to Mexico—not Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, or Haitians—are actually from Mexico. Our southern neighbor is just the closest and most convenient place to dump these desperate human beings, who will then be on their own to figure out their next move. According to The Washington Post, U.S. officials insist that the Mexican government has agreed to take in an additional 30,000 migrants from each of those four countries every month.

Oddly, the Biden policy doesn’t seek to limit the entry of people from countries like Sweden, Germany, Canada, or Norway. Also, as a sign of the times, there is no attempt to limit the entry of light-skinned refugees from Ukraine or Russia. Instead, now that both are lining up in Tijuana just eight miles south of San Diego with hopes of entering the United States, the administration appears eager to roll out the red carpet. You may recall that last year Biden pledged to take in 100,000 Ukrainian refugees.

Biden claims that these new restrictions will end the current crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border. We can expect that to be the message he takes with him to El Paso on Sunday, when he visits the epicenter of the border chaos. It will be the first visit that Biden has paid to the border, an area it’s obvious he knows very little about—with no desire to learn more.

While Biden is in “El Chuco” (as the West Texas border city is called by locals), maybe he’ll bump into the woman from Venezuela who told a reporter for the Dallas Morning News that she doesn’t want to hurt our country, only to contribute to it while starting a new life.

Are these the people we’re so terrified of?

Biden’s border shenanigans make me almost miss the good old days of Donald Trump. The former president may have pursued a nativist agenda, but at least he came right out with it. You knew who and what he was.

Heck, on that day in June 2015 when Trump announced that he was running for president, he pretty much labeled my Mexican grandfather a rapist and drug trafficker. So much of Trump’s presidency was disgusting and profane, and his immigration policies set that tone.

But at least I didn’t have to constantly watch my back and wait for the next betrayal, the way I do with Biden.

We’re in uncharted territory, folks. Until last week, the worst thing one could say about Joe Biden on the topic of immigration is that he served as vice president to a former president—Barack Obama—who deported three million people and put Central American refugees in cages. Or maybe one could make the argument that Biden is just as bad as Trump—because the 46th president was fixing Trump’s border wall, preserving Title 42, and expanding a “Remain in Mexico” policy that he had also promised to end.

Now, everything has changed. Biden is in a class by himself. With his new immigration crackdowns, he has gone beyond the Trump policies.

As presidents go, Biden is the top immigration restrictionist in modern U.S. history. Worse, some of his most dubious policies seem to be at least partially driven by race.

Remember this the next time you hear the left accusing Republicans of being thick-headed racists when it comes to immigration. A Democratic president, and the leader of the party, just surrendered the moral high ground on the issue—not for a generation or two, but forever."

Feb 06 2024,Another Political Failure on Immigration,New York Times (Opinion),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/02/opinion/border-deal-senate-biden.html,"President Biden’s assertion that he’s ready to sign a border deal — one that would make it much harder for migrants to enter the United States — is a necessary and long overdue step to restore the public’s confidence in the federal government’s ability to maintain control over immigration.

The crush of asylum seekers crossing the southern border has overwhelmed the government’s capacity to deal justly with their claims. The needs of the migrants have strained the resources of cities and towns across the country; in the absence of federal help, these communities are finding it difficult to maintain humane conditions for everyone who crosses. This situation is untenable.

Democrats have been too slow to respond to the increasingly urgent pleas from mayors, governors and voters to act. Republicans deserve credit for pressing for action, and they ought to be celebrating that Mr. Biden has now accepted many of the strict border security measures that they have long pushed for. But Donald Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, insists that Republicans reject the legislation taking shape in the Senate. Several Senate Republicans have said Mr. Trump is blocking it to keep immigration alive as a campaign issue. Senator Todd Young of Indiana called this move to derail the negotiations “tragic.” He and the other Senate Republicans nevertheless continue to work with their Democratic colleagues to hammer out a compromise.

House Republicans, however, don’t seem interested in writing laws; they have instead submitted to Mr. Trump’s demands. The House speaker, Mike Johnson, says any bill the Senate sends to the House will be “dead on arrival.” Instead of negotiating with Democrats, they are pressing ahead with a farcical effort to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary of homeland security."

One man walked along a road, looked out beyond the tall shrubbery and later said the country needs a “new, efficient and fair process for the government to consider asylum claims.” Three hundred miles away, another man walked on a dirt path surrounded by razor wire and later said a “vicious violation to our country” was already underway.

What was on display Thursday, when President Biden and Donald Trump flew to separate parts of the U.S. southern border, was the potency of the immigration issue heading into the November election.

Also on display was the first real split-screen moment, a chance for American voters to directly compare the two very different policies, arguments and styles of the leading presidential candidates.

Scene 1: The arrivals

Biden arrived in Brownsville, Tex., and met with federal Border Patrol agents, and local law enforcement officials. He wore a baseball hat, a buttoned suit jacket and an open collared shirt as he walked along a portion of the border and officials pointed to where people have crossed into the country.

Danger or urgency around the situation at the border was not immediately present in the Biden scene.

Trump’s visit to a different city along the U.S.-Mexico border was the opposite.

The former president, in a blue suit and long red tie, met with Border Patrol officials and members of the Texas National Guard, who showed him that part of the border. At one point Trump walked by what looked like a wall of razor wire and a parade of military vehicles.

Scene 2: The briefings

Television cameras captured Biden speaking with officials inside the Border Patrol station in Brownsville. The room was decorated with American flags, and on one wall was a sign that read, in part: “Sworn by Oath.”

One person who briefed Biden spoke about the challenges of “handling the surge of families, of minors, of adults coming into the United States.” “Smugglers,” this person said, “are taking advantage of these vulnerable populations and individuals that are coming across.” There was also talk about the need for more technology and manpower to help detect weapons and drugs at the border. Another person told Biden about how they “tried to be very creative” to handle the overwhelming number of asylum requests that have been filed.

Trump, for his part, got a very different briefing in Eagle Pass.

Share this article Share

Inside a large white tent, Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Tex.) pointed to a photograph and told Trump, “Joe Biden entices them, if not forces them, to come right here.” One person in green military fatigues who briefed Trump inside the tent could be heard talking about the dangers posed by migrants, despite crime data showing that the threat is relatively low.

Thousands of people are “paroled into the country,” this person said, and they “go to Georgia and kill a nursing student” or “go to New York and beat up cops on the street,” or “they go to Louisiana and rape a 14-year-old girl.”

Scene 3: The speeches

Inside the room in Brownsville, Biden focused on the people working hard at the border, and the ones in Washington who he said were making it hard to work at the border.

Biden praised the work of Border Patrol agents, as well as immigration enforcement and asylum officers. “They’re all doing incredible work under really tough conditions,” Biden said. Then he said the solution to this problem is legislation that was being stalled by House Republicans. The bipartisan border deal that Biden referenced included desperately needed funding, he argued. “It’s the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen in this country,” Biden said. He added, “With this deal, we could hire 1,500 additional border security agents” and additional officers “between ports of entry.”

In Eagle Pass, Trump stood outside, with the heavily protected Rio Grande at his back, and said the country was in danger from the people on the other side of all that equipment. “They’re coming from jails, and they’re coming from prisons, and they’re coming from mental institutions,” Trump said falsely. “And they’re coming from insane asylums, and they’re terrorists. They’re being let into our country.”

Trump also tried to other the people crossing into the country as different from anything inside America, saying, “We have languages coming into our country. We have nobody that even speaks those languages.”

The comments were reminiscent of the racist attack he used against Mexicans when he launched his presidential campaign in 2015. “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,” he said at the time. “They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.”

Biden eventually turned his attention directly to Trump. When he did, Biden invited him to “stop playing politics” with the border issue and urged him to tell congressional lawmakers to pass the bipartisan legislation. House Republicans opposed the bill after Trump publicly called for them to do so.

“So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done?” Biden said. “Let’s remember who the heck we work for. We work for the American people, not the Democratic Party, the Republican Party. We work for the American people,” he said, ending on the kind of nonpartisan message that he ran on when he sought the presidency in 2020.

Trump, on the hand, invoked Biden’s name only to brand it as part of the problem."
Feb 29 2024,Trump and Biden collide in split-screen trips to the border with immigration in the spotlight,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-biden-collide-split-screen-trips-border-immigration-spotlight-rcna140899,"BROWNSVILLE, Texas — Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump visited the southern border Thursday in a dramatic split-screen moment as the 2024 presidential campaign ramps up over an issue that has confounded administrations of both parties for decades: immigration.

Biden’s briefing from border officials here began just moments after Trump began his remarks in Eagle Pass. Biden thanked border agents and said he would get them more resources “come hell or high water.”

“It’s long past time to act,” he said, adding that border control “desperately” needs more resources.

Biden made a direct appeal to Trump, asking him to join him in telling Congress to pass the bill, which was tanked after Trump rallied his allies in Congress against it.

“You know and I know it’s the toughest, most efficient, most effective border security bill this country’s ever seen,” Biden said. “So instead of playing politics with the issue, why don’t we just get together and get it done?”

Biden touted the bipartisan border bill as “a win for the American people,” calling it a “truly bipartisan initiative.” He called on the Senate to reconsider the bill, asking senators to “set politics aside” and for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to put the bill on the floor.

“We need to act,” Biden said, adding that Republicans in Congress needed to “show a little spine.”

Trump's national press secretary hit back at Biden's appeal.

""Instead of shifting the blame on everyone but himself, Joe Biden should take responsibility for the border crisis, deaths, and destruction that his policies have caused, say Laken Riley’s name, and use his executive power to shut the border down today,"" Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

In his remarks, Trump said the death of Riley, 22, a graduate nursing student who was killed this month while on a jog near the University of Georgia, was “barbaric” and referred to her as “a beautiful young woman.”

Conservatives across the country have pointed to Riley’s death as an example of migrant crime after an undocumented Venezuelan migrant was charged in connection with her death.

Trump revealed Thursday that he spoke to Riley’s parents Wednesday. “They’re incredible people that are devastated beyond belief,” he said.

Trump also called the migrant crisis a “Joe Biden invasion” and a “vicious violation to our country.”

The trip to the border was Biden’s second since he took office. His first was to El Paso in January 2023. This time, he visited Brownsville, a border town in the Rio Grande Valley that has long felt the impacts of migration up close.

Critics of the administration have pointed out that Biden is visiting Brownsville at a time when the direst consequences of the migrant influx have shifted elsewhere. Many more immigrants are now crossing at other parts of the border, such as Arizona and Eagle Pass, according to Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency that includes the Border Patrol.

Trump has visited the border many times before — and he announced his trip before the White House did. Biden said this week that he’d been planning to go but that he didn’t know “his good friend” would be there the same day. Two senior administration officials said the timing of the trip was meant to maximize its political impact a week before the State of the Union address. One of the officials said “we welcome the split screen” with Trump.

""Nice weather. Beautiful day. But a very dangerous border. We’re going to take care of it,"" Trump told reporters in Texas.

Trump joked of Biden on a radio show this week: “Well, we found out how to get him off his ass. It took me announcing that I’m going down to the border.”

On Wednesday, the White House insisted Biden's trip had already been planned.

“We just can’t all of a sudden put something on the president’s schedule,” Jean-Pierre said, responding to a question about whether Trump’s visit prompted the White House’s announcement. “It takes time to do that.”

An NBC News poll from January found that 57% of registered voters said Trump would handle securing the border better, while 22% said the same for Biden. The poll found that 48% of people said they would trust Biden to treat immigrants humanely, while 31% said the same of Trump.

The Biden administration has been making the case that House Republicans — at Trump’s urging — torpedoed a bipartisan bill that included $20 billion for border security. It was hashed out in the Senate and endorsed by the Border Patrol Union. The White House said it would have added 100 immigration judges, 1,500 Customs and Border Protection personnel and 4,300 asylum officers, as well as more detention beds. It would have also funded the installation of more inspection machines to detect fentanyl at ports of entry.

But Johnson, the House speaker, said the Senate version didn’t go far enough to deal with the border crisis. Democrats accuse the GOP of refusing to compromise to keep the immigration issue front and center during an election year to claim that Biden hasn’t done enough to stop the migrant influx.

With Congress failing to act, Biden has been considering executive actions to tighten asylum rules. Migrants' advocates and progressive Democrats have urged him not to do so, arguing that making it harder for immigrants to claim asylum opens them up to dangerous conditions in Mexico.

The Democratic National Committee said Thursday that it would display a mobile billboard in Eagle Pass during Trump’s visit criticizing him over his efforts to kill the bipartisan border bill and his immigration agenda.

The billboard will say Trump ""broke the border"" during his administration, ""and now for pure politics, he's killed the bipartisan border deal,"" according to the committee.

“If given the chance, Trump would double down on his cruel, chaotic, and inhumane immigration agenda of ripping away children from their parents, rounding up people into detention camps, and using the military to carry out mass deportations,” DNC spokesperson Alex Floyd said in a statement. “When voters head to the ballot box this November, they’ll remember how Trump put himself and his political ambitions ahead of securing the border and delivering for the American people.”

Republicans insist that the Trump administration’s border policies deterred illegal immigration and secured the border. Illegal crossings were lower during most of his term, but they did start to rise in late 2019 before the Covid pandemic. Before that, even Trump himself backed off one particularly controversial hard-line immigration policy — what was known as “zero tolerance” — which led to the forced separation of migrant families at the border in 2017.

When Biden took office in 2021, he promised a return to more “humane” immigration rules and immediately signed executive orders rolling back some Trump-era policies. In 2022, the Biden administration also ended a rule that was known as “Remain in Mexico,” which mandated that asylum-seekers wait across the border while their claims were adjudicated.

But the White House soon found that its policies didn’t stem the flow of migrants after the pandemic limits lifted. Instead, record numbers of immigrants began arriving at the southern border. The Border Patrol reported 1,659,206 encounters with migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in the 2021 fiscal year, topping the previous highs of 1,643,679 in 2000 and 1,615,844 in 1986.

Trump and his supporters blamed what they saw as Biden’s lax policies for the influx. The Biden administration argued the migration was due to other factors, including seasonal fluctuations, recent hurricanes in Central America and misinformation promoted by human smugglers.

Regardless, the migrants have kept coming. And coming. Border cities in Texas, such as El Paso and Eagle Pass, have been overwhelmed at times with an unprecedented influx that has stretched local resources thin and prompted frantic calls for federal help. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott escalated the border battle by assigning state troopers to patrol the border in defiance of the federal government. He also started busing migrants to what he called sanctuary cities across the country, which the White House has called a “political stunt.”

Since then, major cities such as New York, Chicago and Denver have struggled to care for tens of thousands of migrants who have arrived. The White House said the stalled bipartisan border bill would have included $1.4 billion for cities and states and expedited work permits for immigrants who qualify."
Mar 03 2024,Nursing student's death leads Georgia House to move forward on immigration bill,Georgia Law News,center,https://georgialawnews.com/nursing-students-death-leads-georgia-house-to-move-forward-on-immigration-bill,"Republicans in the Georgia House of Representatives are pushing to require every eligible police and sheriff's department to help identify, arrest and hold undocumented immigrants for deportation.

The proposal passed the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Public Safety and Homeland Security on February 27 and was sent to the full House of Representatives for further debate after police accused a Venezuelan man of committing a crime on the University of Georgia campus of beating a nursing student to death.

Jose Ibarra was arrested Feb. 23 on murder and assault charges in connection with the Feb. 22 death of 22-year-old Laken Riley. Mr. Ibarra is a Venezuelan citizen who entered the United States illegally in 2022, according to immigration authorities. It is unclear whether he has applied for asylum.

Ms. Riley studied nursing at Augusta University's Athens campus after beginning her college career at the University of Georgia's Athens campus. She was found dead on February 22 after a roommate reported that she had not returned from a morning run in a wooded area.

Also on February 22, the University of Georgia announced it would spend $7.3 million to improve campus security, and Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives demanded information about Mr. Ibarra from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The bill would move Georgia closer to states with stricter immigration laws like Texas, which starting in March will allow police to arrest migrants entering the state illegally and give local judges the power to expel them from the country

Georgia itself had already passed a strict anti-immigration law in 2011, but later withdrew parts of it. That measure allowed officials to block anyone deemed “suspicious” from checking documents, required governments and large companies to use a federal database called E-Verify to check the immigration status of new employees, required applicants for public benefits, required proof of citizenship and set up a panel to punish local governments that didn't crack down.

The bill, which Georgia's committee passed on Feb. 27, would also establish new requirements for how prison officials at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) should check whether people are known to be in the country illegally.

“This issue is certainly the most important issue in my community right now as we have faced an unspeakable tragedy in Athens over the past few days,” said Republican Rep. Houston Gaines of Athens.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center counted six of 159 Georgia counties with 287(g) agreements with ICE in July. Five of them are just in prison. Oconee County, a suburb of Athens, issues arrest warrants for immigration violations and deportation orders. State agencies also cooperate with ICE.

According to the center, at least three counties in Georgia have stopped cooperating with ICE at the jail, including two large suburban Atlanta counties where it was a major election issue — Gwinnett County and Cobb County.

Isabel Otero, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center in Georgia, said the bill's supporters are “determined to force localities to enforce immigration laws” even if police and sheriff's departments lack the capacity to do so.

“Unfortunately, people have exploited the death of a young woman for political gain in a way that is really disheartening,” Ms. Otero said.

Republican state Rep. Jesse Petrea of ​​Savannah said the bill is necessary to enforce existing laws that require sheriffs to check with ICE on people who do not appear to be American citizens.

“Maybe half of our sheriffs follow this law,” said State Representative Petrea. “That’s unfortunate, and that’s what we’re trying to address here.”

Sheriffs deny they are breaking the law, said Terry Norris, executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs' Association. He said even Athens-Clarke County, which Republicans call a “sanctuary” for undocumented immigrants, is complying.

State Representative Petrea's bill would make sheriffs who fail to check immigration status guilty of the crime of violating their oath of office. The bill would also deny state funding to prisons and sheriffs that don't cooperate.

The law stipulates that detainees cannot be held in an immigration detention center for more than 48 hours without a warrant signed by a federal judge. However, in later states, sheriffs and jailers must comply with all requests from ICE detainees.

State Representative Gaines is pushing a second bill, House Bill 1359, that would allow people to seek property tax refunds if cities or counties refuse to communicate with immigration authorities. The refunds would also apply if a local government refuses to enforce vagrancy laws against homeless people.

The University of Georgia said it will increase its police budget by 20% to hire more officers and increase salaries. The university said the additional security personnel will patrol areas where students gather at night, including 24-hour guarding in libraries. It also said a subsidized ride-hailing system would operate from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., instead of the current four hours a night.

The university said it will install a system of combined surveillance cameras and blue light emergency call boxes. The university had previously removed emergency call boxes on the grounds that they were rarely used by cell phone-carrying students. More lights at zebra crossings, license plate readers and more fences are also planned.

The university said the package will cost $7.3 million, including $5.5 million in one-time investments and $1.8 million in ongoing expenses.

In Washington, Republican chairmen of several House committees sent separate letters to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas demanding information about how ICE handled Mr. Ibarra's case.

Authorities have not said exactly how Ms. Riley was killed, only that her death was caused by blunt force trauma.

District Attorney Deborah Gonzalez, who oversees prosecutions in Athens-Clarke County, said on Feb. 26 that she was appointing a special prosecutor to prosecute Mr. Ibarra. District Attorney Gonzalez, who is up for re-election this year, has been criticized for being ineffective, having lost several cases and had several deputy district attorneys leave office.

Georgia lawmakers face a key deadline on Feb. 29, the last day for legislation to pass either the House or Senate and move to the other legislative chamber for consideration this year. Lawmakers will decide March 4 on issues including whether to tighten rules for law enforcement cooperation with immigration officials and establish government protections for religious freedoms.

Mar 04 2024,5th Circuit rules Texas immigration enforcement law can take effect,KXAN News,not-yet-rated,https://kxan.com/news/texas-politics/5th-circuit-rules-texas-immigration-enforcement-law-can-take-effect,"AUSTIN (Nexstar) — The Biden Administration is urging the Supreme Court to block a new Texas immigration enforcement law. For now, the high court is temporarily keeping the law from taking effect.

On Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court’s ruling that temporarily blocked Senate Bill 4 from going into effect. On Monday, the Biden Administration said it is suing to keep the law from taking effect.

SB 4 gives state police the ability to arrest and effectively deport migrants. The law creates a new state crime for crossing into Texas outside of a port of entry, punishable as a Class B misdemeanor. Repeat offenders could face a state jail felony, and state magistrate judges may order them to return to Mexico.

The Supreme Court is considering whether to let the law take effect while the federal government appeals. The law could take effect next Wednesday, March 13, if the high court does not intervene.

U.S. District Judge David Ezra’s issued a preliminary injunction halting the law last Thursday, saying it violates the Constitution’s supremacy clause and is in conflict with the nation’s immigration laws.

The appeals court did not give explanation Saturday for its decision and set seven days before its order takes effect.

Gov. Greg Abbott signed SB 4 in December, touting it as a historic measure to empower Texas state and local law enforcement to control immigration — a power currently only reserved for federal authorities.

Opponents have argued the bill violates the supremacy clause under the U.S. Constitution, which gives the federal government ultimate authority in enforcing immigration laws, which has been reinforced by a 2012 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Arizona v. United States. After Arizona passed a similar law to SB 4, the High Court ruled that it is not within state and local police officers’ powers to arrest someone based on their immigration status.

Rep. David Spiller, one of the bill’s authors, said he was “pleased” with the 5th Circuit’s ruling in a statement to Nexstar.

“I believe SB 4 is completely constitutional because it is not in conflict with the precedent set in the Arizona v. United States case, it’s not preempted by existing federal immigration law, it’s not in conflict with existing federal immigration law, and Texas has the absolute constitutional right, authority and ability to protect and secure its borders and its sovereignty,” Spiller said."
Mar 06 2024,Immigration ‘parole’ is a well-worn tool for US presidents. It faces a big test in 2024 elections,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-parole-trump-biden-latin-america-hungary-vietnam-cuba-venezuela-6deab463a9cc596b2cd1adc6443da787,"Joe Biden has made more use of immigration “parole” than any American president to bypass an uncooperative Congress, but he’s hardly the first.

The presidential power has been a centerpiece of Biden’s strategy to channel immigrants through new and expanded legal pathways and discourage illegal crossings, a radical difference from his rival Donald Trump.

Biden granted at least 1 million temporary visits, which generally include eligibility to work. Trump has said during his campaign to return to the White House that he would end the “outrageous abuse of parole.”

Parole, which was created under a 1952 law, allows the president to admit people “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” It has been ordered 126 times by every president since then except for Trump, according to David Bier of the pro-immigration Cato Institute.

The Associated Press spoke with immigrants who arrived during four major parole waves over the past 72 years.

HUNGARY, 1956

Edith Lauer was a 14-year-old student when she left Budapest with her parents and older sister Nora in November 1956. Her parents felt unsafe after Soviet tanks invaded, crushing a short-lived revolt against the Moscow-controlled government. Many fled, including about 32,000 who were paroled in the United States.

“They knew that if they waited around, they would be arrested, (possibly) tried in a communist trial … and or executed,” Lauer, 81, recalled from her home in Cleveland.

The four went to a military base in Munich, where they stayed for weeks until her mother’s cousin sponsored them and offered his house in Silver Spring, Maryland.

Edith Lauer arrived by military plane at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, a former army camp converted to Hungarian refugee housing.

“My God, this is freedom, democracy, it was just a totally different world,” she remembers thinking. “I recognize that very, very soon, and … everybody was so welcoming and so wonderful.”

Her father, a lawyer and the only one in the family who spoke English, became a librarian at the Library of Congress. Her mother started as a dishwasher and went on to work at a laboratory producing serum from monkeys.

In 1963, Lauer married an American student she met at the University of Maryland who later became a corporate executive. She graduated from Texas A&M University and became a teacher. She has two daughters and two grandchildren, and founded a nonprofit organization to promote understanding of her people.

VIETNAM, 1975

The Vietnam War era produced an exodus from Southeast Asia that brought parole to about 340,000 people.

Kim-Trang Dang was a 25-year-old law student working as teacher when she left Saigon with her then-husband, two siblings and five other family members. Her father and two sisters had left days earlier. It was April 1975, just before the capital of South Vietnam fell to North Vietnamese communist forces.

They drove a half-hour in the middle of the night to a river port where a boat was waiting. There were bombs, and fire in the streets, but they were told a U.S. military ship was going to pick them up at sea.

They went to Subic Bay, the Philippines, and then Guam, before being transferred to a camp at Fort Chaffee, a military installation in western Arkansas where they stayed for about a month waiting for a sponsor who could take them out to live in the U.S.

The sponsor offered them his house in Tampa, Florida. Kim-Trang got a job at a shrimp factory, where she spent eight hours a day pulling off shrimp skin and had English classes at night. She moved to San Diego in the 1980s and got a job as a social worker at a Catholic organization, where she retired after 23 years.

Kim-Trang, 73, has three U.S.-born children and five grandchildren.

“I’m happy that I have a freedom here, and I don’t live under the communism,” she said. “When I met them, the Americans were really nice ... They opened their arms to us. If they don’t open their arms, we don’t know where to go.”

She had her own business taking care of the elderly. Now, she volunteers as president of a Vietnamese service organization. She became a U.S. citizen in 1980.

CUBA, 1980

Mabel Junco, who arrived at Key West, Florida in a fishing boat rented by her uncle, was one of about 125,000 Cubans who got parole in 1980. They were processed at refugee camps in South Florida.

Junco’s family disapproved of the Cuban government and in April 1980 leader Fidel Castro unexpectedly announced that any Cuban who wanted could leave the island from the port city of Mariel.

Mabel, then 11, relied on an uncle who had lived in Miami for almost 10 years. He rented a fishing boat for her, her parents, and older sister, who was 16. They left their home in Havana for the port city of Mariel and found the boat was in bad shape, and full of people.

Mabel, her mother and her sister boarded another boat carrying women and children. Her father and uncle stayed in the damaged boat, which was towed by another until a U.S. Coast Guard vessel rescued them. After a night of sailing, they reunited in Key West as part of what became known as the Mariel boat lift.

After about three months at the uncle’s house, the family moved into a rented one-bedroom apartment. The parents obtained work permits and would leave early in the morning and return at night. The two girls walked to and from school alone, cooked and did housework.

The mother, who was a seamstress in Cuba, worked in a clothing factory in Miami. The father drove trucks, like he did in Cuba, until a few years later he opened a transportation company for the elderly. Four years later the family had their own house, with a room for each person.

“In Cuba things were very difficult, very bad,” said Junco, now 55 and a teacher in Jacksonville, Florida. “Here life has given us many opportunities, we have fought forward … my parents always taught us that you come to work, and you do not get anything free from the government.”

Junco married a Cuban who left the island when he was three years old. They have two sons, 30 and 26.

VENEZUELA, 2023

Berioskha Guevara has no words to describe her happiness living in the United States. After decades of fear as a political opponent in Venezuela and struggles to buy staples like milk and bread, the 53-year-old chemist feels she is dreaming.

Guevara and her 86-year-old father came to the U.S. under the sponsorship of her brother, a pharmacist who left after Hugo Chavez took power in 1999.

“Now we are like in paradise,” said Guevara, who arrived in July 2023. “I can’t stop smiling, making plans, thanking God because without parole I would never have been able to live my dreams as I am living them now.”

More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country as it went into an economic tailspin over the last decade. They are increasingly headed to the United States, which prompted the Biden administration to offer parole to 30,000 people a month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Texas and 20 other states sued, saying the administration “effectively created a new visa program —without the formalities of legislation from Congress” but does not challenge large-scale parole for Afghans and Ukrainians. A judge has yet to rule after an August trial.

In Venezuela, Guevara graduated in 2003 with a bachelor’s degree in chemistry and for the last decade worked at a foreign private oil company earning $200 a month. It was a relatively good salary for Venezuelans, but inflation was very high, and food scarce. She worried about being arrested for being an opponent of the government.

In the U.S., four months after filing for work authorization, she got a job at a supermarket. She is looking for work that would use her chemistry background while living with her father in her brother’s one-bedroom apartment in Orlando, Florida.

An intercepted package from Colombia to Wisconsin led authorities to a to a drug bust and discovery of forged immigration papers.

Kenosha County Sheriff's Department and the Department of Homeland Security Investigations Team conducted a joint operation to serve a search warrant at a Kenosha residence Friday, according to a press release.

The week prior, the sheriff's office was contacted by HSI in reference to an intercepted package containing a set of Canariam rollerblades en route to Kenosha from Bogota.

""With the assistance of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the wheels of the rollerblades were identified as suspicious,"" the sheriff's office Facebook post reads. ""It was then discovered the wheels were infused with a gelatin-like substance that tested positive for the presence of cocaine.""

The sheriff's office said the following items were found during the search of the home: 1048 grams of cocaine, which the sheriff's office says has a street value of $35,000 if sold by the kilogram; $3,475 in cash; money transfer documents from Kenosha to Bogota totaling over $30,000; and numerous forged documents, including false permanent resident alien cards, social security cards and Colombian identification cards

Analyzing the midterms in Virginia on a five-leftist panel, Jen Psaki got the ball rolling with this out-of-touch statement:

PSAKI: I mean, if you look at some of these exit polls, and I live in Virginia, immigration (tittering and giggling heard in the background from the panel) was the number one issue ... I mean, these could change, in Virginia...

Maddow then butted in to let Psaki know what all the giggling was about:

MADDOW: Well, Virginia does have a border with West Virginia ... very contested area, build the wall! (explosions of guffaws, cackles, and giggles cascade through the broadcast, Psaki giggling loudest of all.)

It can be viewed from this tweet with this MSNBC news video clip:

Jen Psaki, Joy Reid, and Rachel Maddow are laughing on MSNBC at the fact that voters in Virginia care about immigration:

What an insult.

First off, why the hell did this hag bring up West Virginia. The state of Virginia shares borders with Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. They singled out West Virginia, though, based on its white hillbilly reputation, despite facts, rendering the beautiful state that John Denver and Joni Mitchell once sang about a leftist punchline for all that is outre, not-our-kind-dear, deplorables-deploring claptrap. In other words, 'we swampers of Virginia are not like them and wouldn't dream of letting them in our breathing space.' The elitist snobbery of the remark was obvious, managing to insult two states instead of just one.

Because the other insult was directed at the people of Virginia, who voted the way they did because their state like most others, has also become a ""border state.""

Illegal aliens are flooding the state, owing to Joe Biden's open borders policy, which has spread illegals and their crime throughout the country.

Virginia itself had this headline, seen in the New York Post just last week:

Venezuelan migrant who entered US illegally charged with raping teen girl in Virginia

O.K., so we know these hags don't read the New York Post.

Earlier this year, the voters got to remember these charmers -- in a report in the Washington Post:

MS-13 terrorized Northern Virginia by killing at random, witnesses say In the first of two trials, prosecutors and former gang members say MS-13 murdered four people in Prince William County to enhance its violent reputation

Sound like a place where you might like to live? Maybe you'd change your voting patterns.

But that's impossible for the MSNBC crew to fathom.

Fact is, migrants and migrant crime have exploded throughout Virginia making Joe's open border not just a Texas problem but a national one. Voters are taking notice and voting out those who bring these criminals and welfare chiselers in, blowing out state budgets and creating problems across the state, including even the tony Virginia suburbs.

It's like these idiots, who comment on the news, don't read the news. They read election results and marvel at results they don't expect, dismissing them as the doing of stupid, ignorant voters.

But they're the stupid ones, not even knowing what's going on in at least one of them's state. They're out of touch. They're out of tune. They don't even try to find out. And they're out there interpreting the news for all the lefties out there who get their talking points from people who don't know what is going on.

Psaki and Maddow didn't succeed in their quest to make Virginia's voters look stupid. They made themselves look stupid. Now they are condemned to a life of surprises. Let's hope November is really surprising for them.

Keep deluding yourselves, morons.

Feb 13 2024,US lawmakers impeach Biden’s immigration chief,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/14/us-house-impeaches-bidens-immigration-chief,"Republican charge against Alejandro Mayorkas is part of push to put migration at the centre of November’s election.

Lawmakers in the United States House of Representatives have impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a second attempt.

Mayorkas was removed in a tight vote of 214-213 on Tuesday, as the Republican-led House blamed President Joe Biden’s immigration chief for a surge in illegal entries from Mexico. The impeachment helps to set the stage for November’s presidential elections, which Republicans hope to centre on the border issue.

Lawmakers passed two articles that accused Mayorkas of “willful and systemic refusal” to enforce immigration law and “breach of public trust”. The Democrat is the first cabinet secretary to be impeached in nearly 150 years.

The move by Republican leaders followed closely on the heels of a failed attempt last week to remove Mayorkas. Having wrongly anticipated how many lawmakers would be present on each side, they had lost by one vote.

US President Joe Biden called the move, the latest in a series of Republican attacks on his administration, a “political stunt”.

“History will not look kindly on House Republicans for their blatant act of unconstitutional partisanship that has targeted an honourable public servant,” he said.

Biden highlighted Mayorkas’s backstory. A Cuban immigrant who came to the US with his family as a political refugee, he spent more than two decades “serving America with integrity in a decorated career” that saw him work as a US attorney in the Justice Department before becoming Secretary of Homeland Security, the president said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson doubled down on Republican criticism of the impeached official: “Since this secretary refuses to do the job that the Senate confirmed him to do, the House must act,” he said.

Bad faith

The vote came amid a showdown between the House and Democrat-controlled Senate over a surge in illegal immigration from Mexico. Apprehensions on the border hit a record 10,000 per day in December.

House Republicans have been accused of acting in bad faith in the impeachment, especially after coming out against a bipartisan deal hammered out in the upper chamber that would have imposed the toughest asylum and border policies in decades.

“Republicans with genuine concerns about the border should want Congress to deliver more border resources and stronger border security,” said Biden, criticising their rejection of the bipartisan plans.

Trial

Impeachment is meant to be a sanction for treason, bribery and other “high crimes and misdemeanours,” according to the constitution.

Seen as the political equivalent of an indictment, the rebuke is largely symbolic, however, as Mayorkas is certain to be acquitted at his trial in the Senate.

The upper house is compelled to open a trial, although it could vote to dismiss the articles, dissolve the trial, or refer the articles to a committee.

Twenty-five legal experts called the push “utterly unjustified” in an open letter and were echoed by constitutional scholars who have also spoken in Congress against Donald Trump’s impeachments, including Jonathan Turley and Alan Dershowitz."
Feb 29 2024,Judge blocks Texas immigration crackdown law; similar bill in the works in Arizona,Arizona's Family,center,https://azfamily.com/2024/02/29/judge-blocks-texas-immigration-crackdown-law-similar-bill-works-arizona,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday blocked a new Texas law that gives police broad powers to arrest migrants suspected of illegally entering the U.S., dealing a victory to the Biden administration in its feud with Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over immigration enforcement.

What does this mean for Arizona?

A similar bill is being proposed in Arizona, specifically designed to crack down on illegal immigration. Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma spoke with Arizona’s Family on HCR 2060, which would ask the voters this fall to approve of what he’s calling “one of the toughest anti-immigration laws ever written.” The proposal is already being wildly considered “SB 1070 2.0″

Current law already requires businesses to use the federal E-Verify system to determine the immigration status of current employees and potential employees. Toma’s proposal would also require that companies check the status of any independent sub-contractors they use. Anyone caught helping an undocumented migrant skirt the E-Verify process could face a class 6 felony charge.

In addition to toughening state employment laws, Toma’s proposal would make state and local governments check the immigration status of anyone seeking a license or applying for public benefit. A law approved by voters in 2004 already requires “verifying the identity of applicants for state and local public benefits,” according to the Arizona attorney general’s website.

“In short if this ballot initiative passes, illegal aliens will have every reason to leave the state of Arizona,” Toma said.

What’s next for Texas?

The preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge David Ezra pauses the Texas law that was set to take effect March 5 and comes as President Joe Biden and his likely Republican challenger in November, Donald Trump, were visiting Texas’ southern border to discuss immigration. Texas officials are expected to appeal.

Opponents have called the Texas measure the most dramatic attempt by a state to police immigration since a Arizona 2010 law, SB 1070, that opponents rebuked as a “Show Me Your Papers” bill. The U.S. Supreme Court partially struck down the Arizona law, but some Texas Republican leaders want that ruling to get a second look.

The lawsuit is among several legal battles between Texas and President Joe Biden’s administration over how far the state can go to try to prevent migrants from crossing the border.

The measure would allow state law enforcement officers to arrest people suspected of entering the country illegally. Once in custody, they could agree to a Texas judge’s order to leave the country or face a misdemeanor charge for entering the U.S. illegally. Migrants who don’t leave after being ordered to do so could be arrested again and charged with a more serious felony.

At a Feb. 15 hearing, Ezra expressed skepticism as the state pleaded its case for what is known as Senate Bill 4. He also said he was somewhat sympathetic to the concerns expressed by Abbott and other state officials about the large number of illegal crossings.

Ezra, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, said he feared the United States could become a confederation of states enforcing their own immigration laws. “That is the same thing the Civil War said you can’t do,” Ezra told the attorneys.

Civil rights groups, who also sued the state, have argued the law could lead to civil rights violations and racial profiling.

Republicans who back the law have said it would not target immigrants already living in the U.S. because of the two-year statute of limitations on the illegal entry charge and would be enforced only along the state’s border with Mexico.

Tensions have remained high between Texas and the Biden administration this year over who can patrol the border and how. Other GOP governors have expressed support for Abbott, who has said the federal government is not doing enough to enforce immigration laws.

Among other things, Texas placed a floating barrier in the Rio Grande, put razor wire along the U.S.-Mexico border and stopped Border Patrol agents from accessing a riverfront park in Eagle Pass that they previously used to process migrants.

Mar 09 2024,"Biden and Trump trade barbs over Laken Riley death, immigration, during dueling campaign rallies in Georgia",CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/news/biden-and-trump-trade-barbs-over-laken-riley-death,"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump held dueling campaign events in Georgia on Saturday – and traded barbs over the death of a nursing student and immigration as they turned their focus towards the general election.

Their campaign rallies, which were the second time Mr. Biden and Trump were in the same state in recent weeks, were underscored by the recent death of Laken Riley, a University of Georgia nursing student who was killed by an alleged undocumented immigrant from Venezuela while jogging on campus.

Mr. Biden apologized during an interview with MSNBC on Saturday, for using the term ""illegal"" to describe the man who allegedly killed Riley during his State of the Union address. He said he shouldn't have used that specific language.

""They're an undocumented person. And I shouldn't have used illegal - it's undocumented,"" Mr. Biden said. Biden added further criticism of Mr. Trump calling immigrants ""vermin"" and saying they are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Trump seized on the comments from Biden, blaming Riley's death on Biden's immigration policies. Trump met with Riley's parents backstage before his campaign event in Rome, Georgia, a city of about 38,000 in Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's district. Rep. Greene interrupted Mr. Biden's State of the Union speech on Thursday, which prompted Biden to say Riley's name.

""They just told me, prior to what I'm doing right now, that Joe Biden went on television and apologized for calling Laken's murderer an illegal,"" Trump said at his rally in Rome, Ga. ""Biden should be apologizing for apologizing to this killer.""

On immigration, Mr. Biden and allies have gone after Trump for encouraging Congressional Republicans to vote against a bipartisan border bill earlier this year.

Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Biden campaign surrogate at his Atlanta rally, said it was ""really rich for the former president to talk about the importance of immigration reform, and he's the reason it died.""

A crucial battleground for both campaigns

The Peach State is a crucial battleground for both campaigns. Mr. Biden won Georgia in 2020 by 12,000 votes – making it the first time that the traditionally red state turned blue in nearly 30 years. Sixty miles away from Trump's remarks, Mr. Biden held a rally in downtown Atlanta as his campaign continued a post-State of the Union launch into the general election.

In his remarks, the president has kept the focus on his contrasts with Trump.

""Donald Trump has a different constituency. Here's the guy who's kicking off his general election campaign in the road up with Marjorie Taylor Greene. It can tell you a lot about a person who he keeps company with,"" Biden said in Atlanta, noting Trump had met with autocratic leader Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, late Friday afternoon at Mar-a-Lago.

Rebuilding his winning coalition in 2020 of minority voters, specifically Black voters in Georgia, will be critical for Mr. Biden. The campaign has said they're investing in media buys for Black and Hispanic-owned media outlets, and the largest political committees representing different minority groups all endorsed Mr. Biden on Saturday.

But while Mr. Biden has made headwinds motivating these groups at the start of this general election period – his current support among Black and Hispanic voters is lower now than it was in 2020, according to a CBS News poll.

""Black voters show up in inspiring and unbeatable numbers to vote for progressive issues and candidates. Our concern is not so much how will black voters perform, but how will the rest of Georgia perform?"" said Keron Blair, an organizer with the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organization founded by Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

""At the same time, the concerns and the critiques black communities have levied against the administration cannot and should not be ignored,"" he added.

Trump's trip to Georgia comes as he seeks to clinch the GOP nomination. The former president is the only major Republican candidate still in the race after former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley dropped out but he has not reached the requisite delegate count. He is within striking distance, and voters in Georgia may deliver Trump the required delegates to officially become the party's nominee.

Georgia, along with Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington, are holding its presidential nominating contests on Tuesday, March 12.

This is Trump's first time back in Georgia since August when he turned himself in at the Fulton County jail on charges from District Attorney Fani Willis' case investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In January 2021, Trump allegedly asked Governor Brian Kemp and other Georgia state officials to add 11,780 votes that would overturn Biden's win in the state.

The Republican governor signed the bill into law last December, arguing the Biden administration's “deliberate inaction” forced the state to act.

“Four years ago, the United States had the fewest illegal border crossings in decades,” Abbott said at the time. “It was because of four policies put in place by the Trump Administration that led to such a low number of illegal crossings. President Biden has eliminated all of those policies and done nothing to halt illegal immigration.”

During a signing ceremony in Brownsville, Abbott said the law's goal is to ""stop the tidal wave of illegal entry into Texas.""

“It creates a criminal offense for illegal entry into Texas from a foreign nation for repeat offenders, that creates the events of illegal reentry with a potential prison sentence term of up to 20 years,"" Abbott noted. “The bill provides a mechanism to order an illegal immigrant to return to the foreign nation from which they entered."""

PolitiFact.com

The two 2024 presidential election front-runners traveled to Texas on Thursday to deliver vastly different messages about a key election issue: immigration.

Former President Donald Trump stoked fear about the people crossing the southern U.S. border, citing recent high-profile criminal cases in which authorities charged immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally. President Joe Biden blamed Republicans for sidelining a Senate immigration bill he said would have given his administration the resources and powers needed to reduce illegal immigration.

Speaking at Eagle Pass, the epicenter of a feud between the state and the federal government, Trump joined Gov. Greg Abbott, the Border Patrol union’s leader and Texas National Guard members.

A few minutes after Trump spoke and about 300 miles south, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-McAllen, and Border Patrol agents joined Biden as he spoke in Brownsville.

Trump spent the hours before his speech blasting Biden’s immigration policies over social media and in a Daily Mail article, seeking to position himself as the only person able to ""stop Biden’s illegal immigrant invasion.""

At the end of his speech, Biden asked Trump to join him in getting Congress to pass the Senate border security bill.

""Instead of playing politics with the issue, why don't we just get together and get it done,"" Biden said.

PolitiFact listened to both presidential candidates. Biden overstated the authority provided to him in the border security bill. Trump made broad, often unsubstantiated statements about the migrants entering the U.S. and his administration’s immigration successes.

Here’s the context behind some of their statements:

Biden overstates possible effect of emergency authority in border security bill

The Senate bill ""would also give me as president, or any of the next presidents, emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border between ports of entry."" — Biden in Brownsville

The Senate proposal, which failed 49-50, sought to enable the executive branch to block people from seeking asylum in between ports of entry if illegal immigration encounters reach certain levels.

That doesn’t mean people would stop coming to the border. A public health policy to mitigate COVID-19’s spread that was in place from March 2020 to May 2023 also largely blocked people from seeking asylum, but border encounters rose.

""There is this idea that we control how many migrants attempt illegal crossings. We do not,"" Theresa Cardinal Brown, the Bipartisan Policy Center’s senior adviser for Immigration and border policy, previously told PolitiFact. ""We control what happens once we encounter someone who has already crossed the border illegally.""

Under current immigration law, people on U.S. soil can seek asylum regardless of how they entered the country. The bill’s emergency authority tried to change that. But the government’s ability to quickly remove people from the U.S. would still hinge on its resources and other countries’ willingness to take back immigrants.

""In short, there is no authority that Congress could pass that would allow for a ‘complete and total shutdown of the border,’"" Brown told us in February. ""That's just not how borders work in any real sense. Especially not our border with Mexico.""

Trump leaves out context on migrants and crime, exaggerates his administration’s success

The person charged with a Georgia nursing student’s murder ""is an illegal alien migrant who was led into our country and released into our communities by ‘Crooked Joe’ Biden.'"" — Trump in Eagle Pass

Laken Riley, a 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student, was killed while on a run Feb. 22. Authorities charged Jose Ibarra with the murder.

Ibarra, a 26-year-old from Venezuela, was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection when he illegally crossed the border in September 2022, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Ibarra was paroled in, allowing him to be released in the U.S. to await further immigration proceedings.

There is conflicting information on whether he was arrested in New York City. ICE told PolitiFact the New York Police Department arrested Ibarra on Aug. 31, 2023, and charged him with ""acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 and a motor vehicle license violation."" ICE said the police released him before immigration authorities were able to issue a detainer request for him. But NYPD told PolitiFact there were no arrests under the name ""Jose Ibarra"" in 2023.

Despite high-profile cases of crimes committed by, or charged to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, research shows that immigrants aren't more likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born people. A 2023 Stanford University study found immigrants are 30% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Research published in 2024 by the libertarian Cato Institute found that in Texas, immigrants in the U.S. illegally have a lower homicide conviction rate than people born in the U.S.

""We ended catch and release."" — Trump in Eagle Pass

This is misleading and doesn’t reflect what happened. Republicans often use the term ""catch and release"" to describe immigration authorities stopping immigrants at the border and releasing them so they can await their court hearings outside of federal custody.

Both Democratic and Republican administrations have followed this practice for decades because there’s limited detention space and court rulings have capped how long someone can be held.

In January 2017, Trump signed an executive order to end ""catch and release."" But a few months later, his own attorney general testified to the Senate that the practice continued because of the long case backlog and a shortage of immigration judges.

""We built 571 miles of border wall, much more than I promised I'd build."" — Trump in Eagle Pass

During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a border wall along at least 1,000 miles of the nearly 2,000-mile U.S. southern border. He didn'o't fulfill that promise.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection data say the Trump administration built barriers along 458 miles. But even most of that construction replaced existing smaller, dilapidated barriers and didn't add to the total miles of southern border barriers.

The amount of new primary barriers built — 52 miles — is about 10 times less than Trump’s estimate. Primary barriers are the first impediment people encounter when trying to cross the border from Mexico; they can block people who are walking or driving.

Mar 04 2024,DOJ presses Supreme Court to stop Texas from creating its own immigration policy,Law & Crime,center,https://lawandcrime.com/immigration/doj-presses-supreme-court-to-stop-texas-from-creating-its-own-immigration-policy-before-greg-abbotts-law-goes-into-effect-in-days,"The Supreme Court has given the State of Texas until March 11 to respond to the federal government’s request to overturn an appellate court ruling that would allow Texas to put its own immigration policy into effect. Justice Samuel Alito extended the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit’s stay of its own order until March 13 in response to the Department of Justice’s Monday afternoon filing. The conservative Fifth Circuit vacated a lower court ruling Saturday, sided with Texas to uphold its controversial immigration law, then administratively stayed its order until March 9. Alito issued the solo order Monday evening, because he is the justice assigned to cover emergency filings in the circuit.

The law at issue is Texas S.B. 4, part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s “Operation Lone Star” — a set of anti-immigration laws that included the installation of razor wire and a floating barrier of buoys in the Rio Grande and the addition of thousands of state troopers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. Arguably the most legally severe portion of Abbott’s initiatives was the authorization for Texas law enforcement to arrest anyone suspected of illegal border crossing and charge them with crimes ranging from misdemeanors to felonies, then to prosecute and punish with jail time or return to Mexico.

On Feb. 29, Senior U.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra ruled against Texas on the law. Ezra, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said that the law is problematic for a litany of reasons. It violates both the Supremacy Clause and Supreme Court precedent, Ezra said. It also conflicts directly with key provisions of federal immigration law and offends American foreign relations and treaty obligations. Moreover, Ezra said, when the U.S. Constitution afforded states the right to protect themselves from “invasion,” it did not use the term in a way that would include border-crossers, even if the crossing was illegal. More generally, Ezra said, “SB 4 threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice.”

Ezra called Texas out for “mistak[ing] the figurative for the literal,” and said the Lone Star State’s argument that President Joe Biden had “abandoned” the task of border protection amounted to hyperbole. The judge found that Texas was unlikely to succeed on the merits of the lawsuit filed by advocacy groups Las Americas and American Gateways and issued an injunction that blocked Texas from enforcing SB4.

The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Ezra’s ruling late Saturday, then immediately issued a seven-day administrative stay of its ruling. When that stay expires next Saturday, the law will go into effect unless the Supreme Court reverses the Fifth Circuit’s order. The appellate court’s opinion has not yet been made public.

The Supreme Court struck down a state law similar to SB4 in 2012 — in that case, from Arizona — and said that regardless of any “under­standable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration,” Arizona was not authorized to create its own immigration laws that undermine federal immigration laws.

Although the makeup of the Court has changed significantly since 2012, many of the current justices have ruled against Texas when it has intruded into matters of immigration.

Opponents of SB4 have said hard-line immigration tactics like SB4 make things less safe in many ways and point to the recent death of a migrant woman and two children in the Rio Grande as just one example of results of Texas “cruel, dangerous, and inhumane” policies at the border. Abbott denied responsibility for the incident and said the three were already dead when Texas officers prevented Customs and Border Patrol officers from rendering assistance.

The Supreme Court has not said whether it will hear the case.

Mar 01 2024,Federal judge blocks Texas' SB4 immigration law that would criminalize migrant crossings,CBS News (Online),left,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-sb4-immigration-law-federal-judge-blocked/,"Eagle Pass, Texas — A federal judge in Austin on Thursday blocked Texas state officials from implementing a sweeping immigration law that would have allowed them to arrest, jail and prosecute migrants who cross into the U.S. illegally.

The Justice Department and the American Civil Liberties Union had challenged the law known as SB4, which was set to take effect on Tuesday, March 5.

In a 114-page order, Judge David Ezra of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas granted the challengers' request for a preliminary injunction preventing Texas officials from enforcing the state law.

Ezra wrote that the Constitution and Supreme Court precedent make clear that states cannot enforce immigration measures without federal approval, and that the Texas law conflicts with federal law. He rejected an argument from Texas that the state's authority to repel an ""invasion"" allows it to enforce SB4, writing that ""surges in immigration do not constitute an 'invasion' within the meaning of the Constitution."" Lastly, he said that allowing Texas to enforce the law would mean states could override federal statutes, a discredited constitutional theory known as nullification.

""[T]o allow Texas to permanently supersede federal directives on the basis of an invasion would amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War,"" Ezra wrote.

In a statement, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to ""immediately appeal this decision, and we will not back down in our fight to protect our state — and our nation — from President Biden's border crisis."" Attorney General Ken Paxton soon filed notice with the court that the state was appealing the ruling.

The appeal will come before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which could pause the district judge's decision while it reviews the case. Either party could ultimately ask the Supreme Court to review the appeals court's action.

Abbott noted that ""[e]ven from the bench, this District Judge acknowledged that this case will ultimately be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court."" The high court could agree to hear the case, or let the lower court's ruling stand as the final word on the issue.

What SB4 would do

Crossing into the U.S. outside of a port of entry is already illegal under federal law, but the Texas law would've criminalized the action at the state level. It would allow state law enforcement officials to stop and detain anyone suspected of entering Texas unlawfully and empower state judges to issue de facto deportation orders.

While Texas troopers have already been arresting some migrant adults who cross the U.S.-Mexico border on state trespassing charges, that effort has required the consent of private property owners. SB4 would not.

Under the law, crossing into Texas illegally from Mexico would be treated as a misdemeanor crime, punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a fine of up to $2,000. Illegal reentry into Texas would be a felony offense, punishable with up to 2, 10 or 20 years in jail, depending on whether the migrant in question had been previously deported or convicted of certain crimes.

SB4 includes a provision that bars state officials from arresting migrants in certain locations, including schools, places of worship and health care facilities.

The law would also allow Texas magistrates to order migrants suspected of committing the new illegal entry or reentry crimes to return to Mexico as an alternative to continuing their prosecution. Those found to violate those orders could be charged with a second-degree felony.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, signed SB4 into law, arguing it's needed to deter illegal border crossings. More than 2 million migrants were apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents along the southern border in both fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the highest levels on record.

But the Biden administration said the state law interferes with federal immigration enforcement. Other critics of the measure have also said it could lead to racial profiling and overwhelm county jails and public safety resources."
Mar 06 2024,SCOTUS blocks Texas immigration deportation law from going into effect — but only until March 13,The Oregonian,center,https://oregonlive.com/reckon/2024/03/scotus-blocks-texas-immigration-deportation-law-from-going-into-effect-but-only-until-march-13.html,"A roundup of conversations we're having daily on the site. Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.

The Supreme Court on Monday blocked the enactment of Texas Senate Bill 4, a controversial piece of legislation that will give state police the ability to arrest and deport people suspected of unlawfully crossing from Mexico.

The legislation was signed into law in December by Gov. Greg Abbott and was expected to take effect on March 5 but was blocked for a few days before the court took up the case. Justice Samuel Alito ordered a delay until March 13 to give Texas time to respond to the Justice Department’s request to stop the legislation.

“SB-4 makes our communities less safe,” Domingo Garcia, the League of United Latin American Citizens national president, said in a statement. “It will result in more harm than good because violations like racial profiling will occur more frequently, primarily because of appearance and the color of people’s skin.”

The Supreme Court’s decision comes after the Justice Department on Monday filed an emergency request asking the Supreme Court to intervene. The court issued a stay as it deliberates.

Advocates say the legislation is the “most extreme” anti-immigration law passed in the country. Advocacy groups filed a lawsuit late December, which was consolidated into a suit with the Department of Justice, stating the law was unconstitutional and contradicted federal immigration policy.

“We have long warned that this law will separate families and harm people across the state as Governor Abbott continues his relentless campaign against people who are immigrants,” according to a joint statement from the advocacy groups. “We urge the Supreme Court to undo the appeals court’s administrative stay and preserve the decision keeping this harmful law from going into effect.”

The situation could continue to rapidly change, the ACLU of Texas said on its SB 4 information page. Last week, U.S. District Judge David Ezra issued an injunction to prevent enforcement of SB 4 while legal procedures continue.

A district court in Texas previously blocked the law, but an appeals court reversed the decision. It would have gone into effect this weekend had President Joe Biden’s administration and civil rights groups like the ACLU, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, American Gateways, and El Paso County Commissioners not asked the Supreme Court to uphold the initial ruling.

Abbott reiterated his belief that “Texas has the right to defend itself” from the “invasion” at the border in a statement on Thursday.

Policy attorney and strategist of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC) Jennefer Canales-Pelaez said if SB 4 goes into effect it will “no doubt” act as a blueprint for anti-immigrant laws in other states.

On Tuesday, the Iowa senate voted down party lines to pass a law that criminalizes people attempting to enter the state after being deported or denied entry, a bill that analysts say is modeled after Texas’ legislation, according to the Des Moines Register.

The ILRC developed a travel advisory map which includes information on counties that have passed anti-immigrant policies in Texas and provides people with knowledge of their rights in the wake of recent legislation."

The presenters at the liberal-leaning news network took jabs at voters while discussing the results of early exit polls on Super Tuesday.

“I live in Virginia. Immigration was the No. 1 issue,” Psaki said, drawing laughter from Reid.

“Well, Virginia does have a border with West Virginia, a — very contested area,” Maddow sarcastically chimed in, setting off more chortles from her co-hosts.

Later in the discussion, Reid broadly painted Republicans as racists who vote against their own economic interests out of bigotry.

“They don’t vote based on economics, or based on the benefits they’re getting economically from the president,” she argued. “They are voting on race; they are voting on this idea of an invasion of brown people over the border, the idea that they can’t get the job they want.”

Reid, who is black, further claimed that GOP supporters want to “drive all the black out of the colleges” and get rid of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

“They’re just voting specifically on racial animus at this stage. It isn’t about economics,” the host of MSNBC’s “The ReidOut” proclaimed, with Psaki nodding along in agreement.

Despite the MSNBC crew’s snide remarks, voters cited immigration as the most important problem facing the US in a recent poll.

The monthly Gallup survey released in late February found 28% of Americans were most concerned about immigration, up from 20% in January.

It marked the first time in nearly five years that immigration topped the list of concerns among surveyed US adults.

The government was cited as the second-biggest problem and the economy as the third.

The group calling immigration the most critical issue included 57% of Republicans, 22% of Democrats and 10% of independents."
Feb 29 2024,"Miles apart, Biden and Trump visit Texas' southern border as the immigration debate intensifies",CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/texas/news/miles-apart-biden-and-trump-visit-texas-southern-border-as-the-immigration-debate-intensifies,"TEXAS - President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump toured different portions of the Texas border Thursday to discuss illegal immigration policies.

As the number of migrants at the southern border has surged to record numbers, the debate over illegal immigration has intensified.

Both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump, the two leading presidential candidates this November, are far apart on this issue.

Thursday afternoon, President Biden was in Brownsville meeting with border patrol agents, law enforcement officials, and local and state Democratic leaders.

He is still pushing for the bipartisan Senate border deal even though it recently fell apart.

The President says the measure would add border patrol agents, asylum officers, immigration judges, and detection equipment for the deadly drug fentanyl.

Former President Trump is 325 miles away in Eagle Pass.

He has also been meeting with border patrol agents, and law enforcement along with Governor Greg Abbott, who briefed him on the state's operations.

Trump and Republicans have criticized the bipartisan border security deal, saying it would allow as many as five thousand migrants to cross into the U.S. on any given day before the President could shut down the border.

President Biden though says the bill would discourage people from coming into the U.S.

""Persons thinking about entering the United States understands the cases to be decided in a few weeks or months instead of 5 to 7 years,"" Biden said. ""They are less likely to come in the first place to not going to pay the cartels thousands of dollars to make that journey.""

""Three years ago, we had the most secure border in history,"" said Trump. ""Brandon was saying it, the general was saying it. We had the most secure border and people weren't coming because they knew they weren't going to get in. And we weren't promising free education, free medical, free, everything.""

The former president has said he would crack down on illegal immigration on his first day if elected and ramp up mass deportation efforts.

The Border Patrol Union did come out in favor of the bipartisan Senate border security bill, but the union continues to sharply criticize President Biden's policies.

Democrats in Congress say Republicans just want to play politics and don't want to solve the problem.

Republicans in Congress say they believe they still have leverage to develop a better bill.

Katie Hobbs (D-AZ) vetoed a border bill Monday that would have made illegal border crossings punishable by law, her first veto of 2024.

Legislative analysis of the bill, SB-1231 or the Arizona Border Invasion Act, stated that illegal immigrants who cross the southern border illegally into Arizona “must be fined and imprisoned for not more than six months, or for not more than 2 years.”

“This bill does not secure our border,” Hobbs said. “On the contrary, it will be harmful for communities and businesses in our state and a burden for law enforcement personnel. I know there is frustration by the federal government’s failure to secure our border, but this bill is not the solution.”

Hobbs also cited constitutional concerns if the bill was signed into law.

Republican lawmakers in Arizona disagreed with the governor’s veto.

“The Legislature did its job to protect our citizens, but Governor Hobbs failed to do hers. Vetoing the Arizona Border Invasion Act is a prime example of the chaos Hobbs is unleashing in our state while perpetuating this open border crisis as Biden’s accomplice,” Republican state Sen. Janae Shamp, a sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. “Our local, county, and state law enforcement officers are pleading for help, and they support this legislation to protect our citizens.”

The veto comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to block a similar Texas law that would allow the state to arrest immigrants who enter the country illegally."

Health care is where Democrats have an actual advantage over Republicans. Still, the spike in violent crime nationwide, especially at the hands of illegals, has forced the Biden White House to tell sanctuary cities it’s time for them to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (via Fox News):

The White House is calling for ""sanctuary"" cities and jurisdictions across the U.S. to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in turning over criminal illegal immigrants for deportation, just as there is renewed scrutiny over such policies in the wake of several high-profile crimes committed by illegal immigrants who had previously been released by local law enforcement despite pleas from ICE. ""We welcome local law enforcement’s support and cooperation in apprehending and removing individuals who pose a risk to national security or public safety,"" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday in response to a question about its stance on sanctuary cities. ""When a local jurisdiction has information about an individual who could pose a threat to public safety, we want them to share that information with ICE."" ""Just since May 12, DHS has removed or returned more than 565,000 individuals — the vast majority of whom crossed the Southwest Border. 565,000 removals and returns is more than every full fiscal year since 2013,"" they said. Sanctuary cities either limit or outright forbid law enforcement from honoring ICE detainers, which are requests from the agency that ICE be notified ahead of their release from state custody and allowed to transfer illegal immigrant criminals into custody. This week it was revealed by ICE that the alleged killer of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley was previously arrested in New York City, but that he was released before ICE could issue a detainer. Separately, there have been other alleged crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including an arrest in connection to the murder of a 2-year-old in Maryland, who had detainers lodged against them but were not honored by authorities. ICE announced this week the arrest and conviction of a Guatemalan illegal immigrant for the sexual assault of a child in Boston. He has been released despite ICE lodging a detainer against him.

The illegal alien at the center of the Laken Riley murder, Jose Antonio Ibarra, was also arrested on shoplifting charges in Athens, Georgia, last fall, where a bench warrant was issued last December when he failed to show up for his court date. Ibarra entered the United States in 2022, where Biden officials tried laughably to declare the border secure and closed. In the meantime, illegal aliens continue to victimize, assault, rape, and murder American citizens because of Biden’s immigration policy. Remember, this is the man in 2020 who said that illegals should surge the border.

Will this reversal do much good? We'll see. The president is bound to catch fire from his left flank, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), a staunch opponent of immigration enforcement measures, being very vocal about this change in direction. In January, Mia wrote about New York City's refusal to honor ICE detainers.

Feb 29 2024,"Biden, Trump both head to border Thursday to talk immigration ahead of Super Tuesday",CBS Austin KEYE,center,https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/biden-trump-both-head-to-border-thursday-to-talk-immigration-ahead-of-super-tuesday-brownsville-texas-border-patrol,"Just five days away from Super Tuesday and the states' party primary elections, President Biden and former President Trump will each be traveling to the Texas border on Thursday to talk immigration.

When President Biden lands in Brownsville for his visit, he'll arrive in the middle of that border city's annual Charro Days Festival celebrating that region’s strong cultural, family and business ties between the U.S. and Mexico.

The local school kids will literally be dancing in the streets with a children's parade Thursday afternoon while President Biden is expected to be meeting with immigration officials and local authorities to discuss the impact of undocumented immigration in far south Texas.



Biden acted surprised after he was told former President Trump had similar travel plans. He told reporters, “I’ve been planning go Thursday, what I didn’t know is my good friend is apparently going.”

Asked about possibly meeting with migrants, Biden answered, “Well. I’m not going to announce ahead of time. Secret Service doesn’t like me announcing exactly where we’re going to be.""

President Biden is only expected to be in Brownsville for four hours, and the recent spike in undocumented immigration is expected to dominate most of the president's schedule. Still, Brownsville Mayor John Cowen, Jr., tells the Brownsville Herald he’s, “looking forward to showcasing — nationally and globally — the city’s successful model for keeping residents safe while humanely managing a high volume of migrants.”

Meanwhile, former President Trump will be 300 miles up the Rio Grande where Eagle Pass has become ground zero for the state's response to what conservatives are calling an ""invasion” and former President Trump has called much worse.

At a campaign rally ahead of the New Hampshire, he told the crowd, “They're poisoning the blood of our country. It's what they've done. Poisoned it. Mental institutions and prisons all over the world, not just in South America and not just the three or four countries we think about, but all over the world.""

In Eagle Pass and up and down the border, where the population is largely Hispanic, locals have staged small protests against how both the state and federal governments are handling of the mass migration they're seeing. And they're worried about racial profiling, especially of local Spanish-speakers.

The protests are calling for change, but to quote a in the Brownsville Herald ahead of the two candidates visits to the border today, “We aren't holding our breath."""
Feb 29 2024,"In clash over immigration, Biden and Trump both bound for the U.S.-Mexico border today",Louisiana Illuminator,left,https://lailluminator.com/2024/02/29/biden-trump-border-2,"Surrogates for President Joe Biden dismissed former President Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to the U.S.-Mexico border Thursday as a political stunt, adding that the likely Republican presidential nominee was exploiting an issue that he has shown no desire to fix.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia of California, both Democrats, told reporters on a Wednesday conference call organized by the Biden reelection campaign that Trump’s record — recently and throughout his public life — showed he was anything but serious about addressing the myriad issues resulting from a recent surge in migration across the southern border.

Trump is scheduled to visit the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, on Thursday to call attention to Biden’s record on border security.

Biden separately will pay a visit to Brownsville, about 300 miles southeast of Eagle Pass.

Trump has no credibility on immigration after tanking a bipartisan agreement to strengthen border enforcement, Pritzker and Garcia said Wednesday. Trump reportedly asked Republicans in Congress not to support the deal to avoid handing Biden a victory in an election year, they noted.

“Republicans frankly just do not care about solving the challenges facing this country,” Pritzker said. “They only care about saving their own skin. This could have been a press call touting a bipartisan path forward. Instead, Donald Trump wanted a campaign slogan.”

In a campaign statement Wednesday, Trump commended his own record on immigration, noting he signed executive orders calling for a wall on the southern border, declaring a national emergency on the border and sending police and military resources to the region.

Trump “created the most secure border in history,” the statement said, and would reinstate several policies that Biden dropped.

Trump would end a policy that allows migrants to live freely in a U.S. community as they await immigration hearings, cease birthright citizenship for the children of migrants in the country without legal authorization — even though an amendment to the U.S. Constitution is interpreted to guarantee that right — and use the military to combat drug cartels, the statement said.

Trump said in a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, on Saturday that he would seek to enact the “largest deportation in the history of our country” if elected.

“The first and most urgent action when we win will be the sealing of the border, stopping the invasion, drill baby drill, send Joe Biden’s illegal aliens back home,” Trump said. “We’ll do all of those things and we’re gonna have to do them fast because no country can sustain what’s happening in our country.”

Garcia, who immigrated to the country as a child, said Trump’s history of racist rhetoric showed he had misplaced priorities on immigration policy.

Trump has used what critics say are racist generalizations of immigrants since his entrance into national politics, a 2015 speech announcing his first White House run in which he made derogatory comments about immigrants from Mexico.

Trump believes “preying on immigrants is his path to reelection,” Garcia said.

“This is a cruel man with a cruel agenda,” he said.

Trump’s “extremism” on immigration would go even further than in his first term, Garcia said.

The former president has talked about returning to the family separation policy at the border, which attracted major controversy in his first term, has expressed support for ending birthright citizenship and said he would act as a dictator for the first day of a potential second term to enact extreme border policies, Garcia said.

Trump and other Republicans have harshly criticized the Biden administration’s approach to immigration, with House Republicans impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas this month over his supposed failure to enforce immigration laws.

Garcia called Trump’s approach to the issue “fearmongering.”

“Donald Trump doesn’t give a damn about border security,” he said. “All he cares about is stirring up pain, stirring up division.”"

U.S. district judge David Ezra sided with the Biden administration, which has argued that enforcement of immigration policies is the exclusive authority of the federal government.

In his order, Ezra explained that giving Texas the right to “permanently supersede federal directives on the basis of an invasion would amount to nullification of federal law and authority — a notion that is antithetical to the Constitution and has been unequivocally rejected by federal courts since the Civil War.”

Senate Bill 4 was set to take effect March 5.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the state is appealing the decision.

""Texas has a clear right to defend itself from the drug smugglers, human traffickers, cartels, and legions of illegal aliens crossing into our state as a consequence of the Biden Administration’s deliberate policy choices,"" he said.

Abbott was confident the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the case.

Feb 29 2024,'Grave irreparable harm': Judge blocks Texas’ draconian immigration bill from taking effect,AlterNet,left,https://alternet.org/judge-blocks-texas-bill,"Texas Senate Bill 4, a controversial immigration measure, was scheduled to go into effect on Tuesday, March 5. But the bill is being held up by a Ronald Reagan appointee.

U.S. District Judge David Alan Ezra, according to ABC News, has ""granted a preliminary injunction"" preventing SB 4 from taking effect. But SB 4 supporters are expected to appeal Ezra's ruling.

Ezra wrote, ""In the final analysis, it is clear that the Plaintiffs, particularly the United States, will suffer grave irreparable harm were SB 4 to take effect, especially where Texas has other aspects of Operation Lone Star in full force. The balance of equities unequivocally weighs in favor of denying the stay pending appeal.""

ABC News' Armando Garcia notes that the lawsuit against SB 4 was ""filed in December 2023 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project on behalf of El Paso County, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and American Gateways"" — and was ""consolidated with one filed by the Department of Justice.""

Passed by the GOP-controlled Texas state legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, SB 4 has inspired heated debates about immigration policy.

The Texas Observer's Gus Bova was highly critical of the bill in an article published on December 14.

""SB 4, passed in November during a dysfunctional fourth special legislative session, grants unprecedented powers to local and state police, judges and magistrates,"" Bova explained. ""For starters, the bill makes it a state misdemeanor crime for a non-U.S. citizen to improperly enter Texas from another country — say, by rafting across the Rio Grande from Mexico. To avoid prosecution, alleged crossers may agree to a judicial order to return to the country they came from; if prosecuted, they face up to six months in jail, after which they’ll be subject to an identical order anyway.""

Bova added, ""Refusal to comply with these state deportation orders constitutes a separate felony offense. The bill also makes it a crime to reenter or be 'at any time found' in Texas after having previously been removed from the country under SB 4 or by the feds. The law's language utterly ignores the fact that deportees can sometimes return legally to America.""

Feb 29 2024,'A pitched battle': Trump and Biden duel over 'broken immigration system' at Southern border,AlterNet,left,https://alternet.org/trump-biden-southern-border,"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are both planning to visit the U.S./Mexico border in Texas on Thursday, February 29. Biden is going to Brownsville, while Trump — the likely GOP nominee in the 2024 presidential race — is going to the town of Eagle Pass, which has become the epicenter of the border fracas between the Supreme Court and the GOP.

In a report for the Washington Post, journalist Arelis R. Hernández emphasizes that the presidential candidates' visits underscore their differences on immigration policy as well as the differences between Brownsville and Eagle Pass. Former Democratic Texas state representative Poncho Nevárez told the Post that the Southern border ""may be the fulcrum for who becomes the next president.""

""They benefit from this psychosis of the locals who say they are overwhelmed,"" Nevárez said. ""Trump sees that if there is going to be a pitched battle on this issue that he wants to be at the flash point.""

READ MORE:'Not welcome here': Texas residents slam Trump as 'traitor' ahead of border trip

Hernández describes Brownsville as a ""Democratic stronghold"" in a state that leans Republican on the whole. Brownsville, according to the Post reporter, is ""in sync with"" the Democratic Party's ""traditional approach to immigration, balancing border security with humanitarian considerations.""

Meanwhile, Eagle Pass, Hernández notes, symbolizes ""anxieties"" about the influx of migrants into Texas. And Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has responded to those concerns with his controversial Operation Lone Star program.

""Texas has filled the vacuum — with troops, razor wire, buses, border wall and Humvees,"" Hernández explains. ""But it has come at a cost: Eagle Pass, in essence, has become occupied territory. State troops seized Shelby Park — a critical stretch of riverfront land — and shut out U.S. Border Patrol agents. City leaders voted not to pursue legal action because they can’t afford it.""

The Post reporter notes that although ""Brownsville is friendlier territory for Biden,"" the Democratic president has ""kept in place many of his predecessor's policies and signaled a willingness to adopt more hardline measures that blur the distinctions between his administration and Trump's.""

READ MORE: FBI foils plot by militiamen to 'start a war' at the Texas-Mexico border

Venezuelan university professor Erick Camejo is among the migrants in Brownsville who is hoping to meet Biden during his visit. Camejo, according to Hernández, is ""seeking political asylum"" in the United States ""after defying"" leftist Venezuelan ""strongman Nicolás Maduro and losing his job.""

Camejo told the Post, ""What fault do I bear for a broken immigration system? I needed help, and this country gave me that chance.""

Jun 01 2023,Protests across the U.S. target Florida’s bigoted immigration law,MSNBC,left,https://msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-day-without-immigrants-protests-florida-rcna87343,"Across the United States, opponents of a newly signed immigration law in Florida chose June 1 as the day to collectively send a message to the state’s governor, Ron DeSantis, and his fellow conservatives: Florida’s economy is doomed without migrants.

Activist groups nationwide held “Day Without Immigrants” protests Thursday, essentially a labor stoppage by migrant workers and their allies in the business community who oppose the draconian law signed by DeSantis. There were also demonstrations against anti-immigrant laws in other states.

The Florida legislation, known as Senate Bill 1718, has been denounced by civil rights activists and religious groups that provide aid to migrants — and it has even garnered international condemnation.

If you caught the May 16 episode of “The ReidOut,” you know Joy highlighted the potential (read: likely) self-injury this law could cause for Florida’s economy. If you missed the segment, read Joy’s take in this blog post:

Joy highlighted the reports of undocumented construction workers walking off their jobs after DeSantis signed the bill, leaving local developers in a bind. She also noted the videos of Latino truckers that went viral on social media, in which the drivers call for fellow truckers to boycott Florida over SB1718.

Thursday’s demonstrations ought to remind Florida Republicans how real — and devastating — such a boycott could be.

Local news outlets reported that several businesses across Florida would be closing their doors June 1. Here’s a report from an ABC affiliate in South Florida. There’s also this report from the Fox affiliate in Tampa Bay, listing dozens of businesses that would be closed in support of the work stoppage.

Keep in mind that all of this backlash has coincided with the launch of DeSantis’ presidential campaign and as he’s pitching himself as a worthy leader of the Republican Party.

Meanwhile, activists are showing the country why DeSantis’ form of bigoted governance is so harmful. Black, Latino and LGBTQ advocacy groups have all issued advisories warning against travel to Florida. People are walking off their jobs and closing their businesses’ doors in protest.

Not exactly what presidential candidates usually want to be associated with.

And rest assured, the demonstrations against DeSantis are only getting started."
Jun 30 2023,Latino groups protest in Tampa on eve of new Florida immigration law,Tampa Bay Times,center,https://tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/06/30/new-immigration-law-tampa-protest-desantis,"TAMPA — Victoria Marin protested under the scorching Tampa sun again Friday, wearing a blue hat, jeans and a dark gray long-sleeve shirt that reads “Mi Familia Vota.” She works for the organization by that name, encouraging and helping Latino voters to go to the polls. She stood under a tent along the side of Dale Mabry Highway near Columbus Street, as she said she’s done at previous protests of immigration politics in Florida.

But there’s one problem: Marin can’t vote. She said she came to the United States from Venezuela seven years ago and is currently in the asylum process for immigrants without legal status. And as of Saturday, when SB 1718 takes effect as law, she will lose her job with Mi Familia Vota.

The new law cracks down on the ability of those who lack proper legal documents to work and live in Florida. The law’s most notable provisions include:

Making it a third-degree felony charge for someone who “knowingly and willfully” transports a person without legal status into the state.

Mandating that hospitals that accept Medicaid must ask about a patient’s immigration status when the patient fills out an intake form.

Requiring private businesses with 25 or more employees to use E-Verify, the online federal system run by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that checks the immigration status of workers.

Invalidating driver’s licenses issued by other states to people unable to prove lawful residency in the country.

Prohibiting local governments from offering IDs to those living in the U.S. without legal permanent status.

Marin said while the new law concerns her, she and others plan to continue protesting. While some without legal status are considering leaving Florida, Marin is not, for now. She pointed to the crowd and said they aren’t demoralized. It’s important to her, she said, to prove immigrants are not criminals.

“We have to demonstrate that immigrants are an important part of the community in Florida,” Marin said.

Marin was one of a few dozen people protesting in Tampa in the hours before the bill becomes law. The street corner was lined with Mexican, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan, El Salvadoran, Honduran, Columbian and American flags. Passing cars blared their horns in support. One woman sat in the bed of a passing pickup truck holding both Mexican and American flags. Others on the street corner held up signs criticizing the new law and Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Another protestor, Nancy Salegio, said she wasn’t fearful about how the new state law would affect her job because she is an American citizen. Still, she said she had attended other demonstrations opposing the law and plans to continue protesting.

“This is my people, this is my blood,” Salegio said.

Her father came to the United States from El Salvador and her mother from Mexico — both without proper legal paperwork — and Salegio was born in America. She wore a headband that said El Salvador, along with an image of that country’s flag, as she used a megaphone to chant with the crowd in English and Spanish.

Salegio said this new law affects everyone as some immigrants leave the state, leaving jobs unfilled.

“We come to work, and we get the job done,” Salegio said to the crowd. “It hurts, what they are doing is inhumane.”

Other speakers included Pastor Felipe Diaz of Tampa Para Cristo church. He spoke to the crowd in Spanish. He said it was important to be at protests like this to give people hope.

Diaz’s message was echoed by many at the protest. The law taking effect is among the strictest immigration laws in the nation, but protesters like Marin said she won’t give up hope.

Even if she can’t work with Mi Familia Vota, she said she’s going to keep protesting."

Daily Caller News Foundation

Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz will retire next month, according to a Tuesday internal agency email obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Ortiz’s retirement will take effect June 30, according to the email. The Border Patrol Chief has overseen the agency during record surges in illegal immigration.

TRENDING: Greatest Show on Earth: The Hur report hearing

“After a 32-year Border Patrol career spanning multiple Sectors, HQ tours, and overseas assignments in Afghanistan, I have decided to retire from federal service on June 30th,” Ortiz wrote in the email.

“Serving as your Chief has been one of the greatest honors and privileges I have had and please know I will always champion this agency, its mission, and the people who make the Border Patrol everything that it is,” Ortiz wrote.

Border Patrol agents recorded more than 2.2 million illegal migrant encounters in fiscal year 2022 at the southern border, according to agency data. So far in fiscal year 2023, agents have recorded more than 1.2 million encounters.

Border Patrol agents have also apprehended 196 individuals whose names appear on the terror watchlist between October 2021 and April 2023.

Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended Worrell this week. She’s a Democrat who was elected in 2020 with 66% of the vote.

In a press conference Wednesday , DeSantis said Worrell hasn’t been tough on crime and has avoided mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes and drug offenses.

In her own press conference, Worrell said her suspension was a political move and she labeled DeSantis “a weak dictator.” Worrell also said she would fight the suspension and run for reelection next year.

We examine how the governor has used his executive power during his tenure and talk about what this all means legally and politically.

Immigration Divide: A look at WMFE’s new multimedia series

Throughout Florida, there are many families of immigrants. Some of those families include members who are undocumented or in the process of obtaining permanent citizenship.

A new series from WMFE, Central Florida Seen and Heard: Immigration Divide , explores how Senate Bill 1718, which went into effect July 1, affects these families as well as its broader impact across over a dozen policy areas.

Jun 26 2023,DeSantis unveils border and immigration policy plan for his presidential campaign,Tampa Bay Times,center,https://tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/06/26/desantis-president-immigration-border-birthright-citizenship-wall,"Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday unveiled a sweeping plan to overhaul the nation’s immigration system and ramp up border enforcement, vowing to end birthright citizenship, “repel the invasion” at the U.S. southern border and use the “levers at our disposal” to ensure cooperation from Mexico.

The plan, which was unveiled during a campaign trip to the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, ushered in the beginning of a new, policy-focused phase of DeSantis’ presidential bid that his campaign has billed as a more direct effort to challenge President Joe Biden.

But the rollout also doubled as an attempt to criticize former President Donald Trump, the heavy front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 White House nomination whose political brand was built in large part on his hardline — and often inflammatory — rhetoric on immigration and border security.

“The reason why I’m really motivated to bring this issue to a conclusion is because I have listened to people in D.C. for years and years and years,” DeSantis told supporters on Monday. “Republicans and Democrats always chirping about this and never actually bringing the issue to a conclusion, never actually getting the job done.”

DeSantis pledged to end “catch and release” — the policy that allows migrants to be released into the U.S. while they await their asylum hearing — reimpose the so-called “Remain in Mexico” policy and finish Trump’s long-promised, though still incomplete, border wall.

DeSantis also said that Border Patrol agents should be able to “respond with force” if they catch drug smugglers attempting to sneak into the U.S.

“If the cartels are cutting through the border wall, trying to run product into this country, they’re going to end up stone-cold dead as a result of that bad decision,” DeSantis said during a news conference after his rollout speech. “And if you do that one time, you are not going to see them mess with our wall ever again.”

DeSantis’ proposals went even further, calling for the end of birthright citizenship, in which the United States automatically grants citizenship to anyone born within its borders. That right is granted under the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States … are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” The Constitution also says that “no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.”

Additionally, DeSantis said he would cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to so-called “sanctuary jurisdictions” that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration law, and deputize state and local governments to enforce immigration law.

“I think the states have a role to play,” DeSantis said. “I can tell you, as a president, we are fully going to deputize all state and local governments to be able to enforce immigration law, you will be able to have that authority.”

DeSantis’ record as governor

As governor, DeSantis has signed legislation that requires all Florida law enforcement officials that operate a county detention center to participate in a federal immigration program, known as the 287(g), designed to identify immigrants who are in the country illegally in county jail after they are arrested. Officers are deputized to work under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the training is paid for by Florida taxpayers.

The program is among a series of state actions DeSantis has taken as governor to have a role in enforcing federal immigration law. Some of the actions have been done with the help of the Republican-led Legislature, but others have been done through executive orders and emergency rules.

In his first term, DeSantis has spent at least $1.6 million to send state law enforcement officers to Texas to help secure the border, cracked down on Florida migrant shelters that care for migrant kids, asked the Florida Supreme Court to impanel a statewide grand jury to investigate immigration-related crimes and launched a strike force that mirrors a broader partisan effort promoted by national Republican groups.

Most prominently, DeSantis created a state-funded program that has allowed him to relocate migrants from Texas to other parts of the country, including Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, and Sacramento, California. The program has led to several lawsuits, including from migrants who say they were tricked into getting on the planes to Martha’s Vineyard, and a criminal investigation by the Bexar County sheriff in Texas.

Addressing supporters in Texas on Monday, DeSantis pledged that, if elected president, he would look to enact at the federal level a version of a sweeping immigration bill Florida lawmakers passed last month that requires businesses with more than 25 employees to use E-Verify, a federal electronic system, to check the immigration status of new hires. The state law he signed exempts independent contractors and those who hire people to do house work, such as housekeepers, maids and gardeners.

A ‘Day One’ Priority

DeSantis vowed on Monday to charge forward on his own whenever possible to impose his immigration agenda.

“When we go in on day one we’re gonna marshal every bit of authority that we have, will work with Congress when we need to, we’ll take executive action when we can, and it will be a day one priority, and you’re gonna see a big change very, very quickly,” DeSantis said.

Among his other proposals: raising pay for Border Patrol agents, restricting visas of countries that don’t accept deportees and defunding nongovernmental organizations and other groups “engaged in facilitating illegal alien processing, human smuggling, and encouraging mass migration.”

DeSantis also used the policy announcement to pivot to foreign policy, saying that as president of the United States, he would use all the “levers at our disposal” to “ensure better behavior” from Mexico.

“I think there is a lot of leverage we have over Mexico that a lot of presidents have not been willing to use,” he said. “I think that they think that somehow that will be bad politically. I don’t think so at all. I think you’ve got to do it.”

While DeSantis did not provide too many specifics on his plans, he seemed to agree with a supporter in the crowd who suggested that Mexico is committing an “act of war” because they are not doing enough to stop migrants from coming into the country.

“I think we should act,” DeSantis said. “I view taking action that is very forward-facing in terms of that because it’s violating our sovereignty and it’s killing Americans.”

DeSantis added that when he is president, he would give Texas law enforcement the authority to deport individuals.

“As president, under Article II of the Constitution, you have a responsibility and a duty to protect the country, and we are going to do that and we are going to do that robustly,” DeSantis said.

Little more than a month into his 2024 presidential campaign, DeSantis has struggled to close a yawning polling gap with Trump. The governor’s policy announcement on Monday — the first major rollout of his White House bid — seized on an issue that Republicans, particularly Trump, have used for years to energize their conservative voter base.

Yet DeSantis still faces tough competition on the immigration front, most notably from Trump, who has sought to elevate the issue in his own presidential bid. Speaking at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s annual conference in Washington, D.C. over the weekend, Trump pledged to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history” and finish building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Jun 23 2023,Supreme Court hands Biden a narrow win on immigration enforcement plan,"""USA Today"" Contributor",left,https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/06/23/supreme-court-hands-biden-narrow-win-on-immigration-enforcement/11412238002,"WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court handed President Joe Biden a rare win Friday in a major immigration case, ruling that Republican officials in two states who challenged the president's effort to prioritize some unauthorized immigrants for arrest and detention over others did not have standing to sue.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for a five-justice majority that included Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett, wrote an opinion that agreed with the final outcome but for different reasons.

Justice Samul Alito dissented.

The states, Kavanaugh wrote, ""want a federal court to order the executive branch to alter its arrest policies so as to make more arrests. Federal courts have not traditionally entertained that kind of lawsuit; indeed, the states cite no precedent for a lawsuit like this.""

What was the latest Biden immigration case about?

◾ At issue in U.S. v. Texas was a Biden memorandum from 2021 that focused enforcement on immigrants who pose a threat to national security, public safety, or who recently crossed the border. The administration says it wanted to prioritize those immigrants because it doesn't have the resources to remove everyone in the country illegally. Texas and Louisiana said federal law gives Biden less discretion to pick and choose enforcement targets.

◾ Kavanaugh wrote that states don't have a stake in whether the federal government prosecutes more or less immigrants. ""After all,"" he wrote, ""the executive branch must prioritize its enforcement efforts. That is because the executive branch invariably lacks the resources to arrest and prosecute every violator of every law.""

◾ In his dissent, Alito wrote that Biden's policy ""inflicts substantial harm on the state and its residents by releasing illegal aliens with criminal convictions for serious crimes.""

Potential implications beyond immigration

Though the policy was at the heart of the case, the justices spent just as much time during the November oral arguments debating whether the states were able to sue and what power lower courts have to block such policies − and that more technical matter wound up deciding the case.

Biden's attorneys questioned whether Texas and Louisiana should be allowed to sue. The states claim the immigration policy forced them to spend more money but critics have said the states have sought to increase their populations and that the same costs – such as for public education – would rise with an influx of non-immigrants as well.

Case trackerRace, religion and debt. Here are the biggest cases pending at the Supreme Court

The decision could have implications for when states may sue a presidential administration over federal policies, which is common. Kavanaugh stressed that the impact of the decision Friday would not give future administrations ""some freestanding or general constitutional authority to disregard statutes."" But Alito wrote that he worried that in future cases, ""presidential power may be extended even further.""

How did the immigration case arrive at the Supreme Court?

Biden laid out his immigration priorities in a Department of Homeland Security memorandum in 2021. But the states said federal immigration law demands more than Biden's approach: It requires the government to arrest and detain immigrants who have committed certain crimes, such as aggravated felonies or human trafficking.

A federal district court in Texas sided with the states and halted the policy's enforcement. A three-judge panel of the New Orleans-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit – all three of whom were nominated by GOP presidents – declined to put the district court's ruling on hold. Biden then filed an emergency request in July asking the Supreme Court to pause the 5th Circuit's decision.

In July, a 5-4 majority of the court declined Biden's request, barring his ability to carry out the policy.

The high court had been set to hear another immigration case in March about whether the government could continue to rapidly expel migrants under the pandemic-era Title 42 program. But after Biden announced he would end the emergency declarations tied to COVID-19, the court removed the case from its calendar.

Biden's lawyers argued the administration doesn't have the resources to do what the states are asking: DHS has about 6,000 interior enforcement officers to deal with more than 11 million people in the country illegally. The administration's priorities don't reduce enforcement, the government argued, but rather focus it on the worst offenders.

Reaction: What experts say about the immigration decision

◾ DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas praised the decision, saying the administration's guidelines will allow immigration officials to ""effectively accomplish its law enforcement mission with the authorities and resources provided by Congress.""

◾ “This decision soundly rejects the misguided attempt by Texas and Louisiana to force the government to implement the most draconian immigration enforcement policy,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants' Rights Project.

◾ Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry accused the Biden administration of ""ignoring Congress and releasing violent criminal aliens into our communities."" Landry called on Congress to pass legislation that would allow states to ""hold federal government officials accountable for their unlawful conduct.""

◾ Brent Webster, first assistant attorney general in Texas, said officials were ""extremely disappointed"" by the decision. ""The state of Texas and our citizens are disproportionately affected by the Biden administration's unlawful immigration policies,"" Webster said. ""And Texas has played a key role in forcing accountability through the court system.""

◾ Stephen Yale-Loehr, a professor and immigration expert at Cornell Law School, noted that the Supreme Court ""refused to issue sweeping proclamations"" and instead ""ruled as narrowly as possible."""
Aug 22 2023,Migrant encounters at southern border on the rise again after Biden touted immigration policy reforms,Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/migrant-encounters-southern-border-rise-again-biden-touted-immigration-policy-reforms,"Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on Friday announced that there were 183,503 migrant encounters at the southern border in July — lower than the same period last year but significantly higher than June’s lower numbers, which the Biden administration had touted as a sign that its policies were working.

There were 183,503 encounters along the southern border in July, which marks a decrease from the 200,162 encountered last July, but an increase from the 144,566 seen in June.

""We remain vigilant and continue to adjust our operational plans to maximize enforcement efforts against those individuals who do not use lawful pathways or processes, knowing that smugglers continue to use disinformation to prey on vulnerable individuals,"" acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said in a statement.

BORDER PATROL SECTORS NEAR OR OVER CAPACITY AS MIGRANT NUMBERS SURGE AT THE BORDER

Numbers had dropped after the end of Title 42 on May 11, before which Border Patrol agents had been encountering record numbers of up to 10,000 a day. While there had been expectations of a new surge, numbers instead went down from May into June.

The Biden administration tied that drop to a slew of new policies, including expanded programs to parole migrants into the U.S. at ports of entry and elsewhere, efforts to tackle root causes in the Hemisphere, the restoration of punishments for illegal entry and a new asylum rule limiting asylum to some illegal entrants. That rule is currently facing multiple legal challenges, including from left-wing groups who say it limits a right to asylum.

""Our approach to managing the borders securely and humanely even within our fundamentally broken immigration system is working,"" Mayorkas said at a House hearing last month. ""Unlawful entries between ports of entry along the southwest border have consistently decreased by more than half compared to the peak before the end of Title 42.""

In July, the number of those entering illegally between ports of entry also increased from 99,545 encounters in June to more than 132,000 in July. Officials noted, however, that the number is still 27% lower than July last year.

The latest release comes after numerous signs that numbers have surged at the border, in both July and August. Fox News reported last week that all four main Border Patrol sectors were either nearing full capacity or are already over capacity. Agents have encountered around 6,000 migrants a day.

Fox has also reported how DHS has put out requests for additional agency volunteers to potentially be deployed to the border, and has also increased the number of ICE special agents at the border.

The administration also included $4 billion for border processing and migration in its $40 billion supplemental budget request.

DHS CALLS FOR MORE AGENCY VOLUNTEERS TO HELP PROCESS MIGRANTS AT SOUTHERN BORDER

Republicans have hammered the administration for its handling of the crisis, blaming its rollback of Trump-era border security measures for the ongoing surge in migrants seeking entry to the U.S. Republican 2024 candidates have rallied around a number of stricter policies, including resuming wall construction, restoring the Migrant Protection Protocols and additional efforts to crack down on human smuggling. Recently, some Republicans have called for a freeze in DHS funding until efforts are made to secure the border.

The Biden administration has pushed back against the criticism, claiming that it is working within a ""broken"" system that Congress has failed to fix — and has called for both additional funding and a comprehensive immigration-reform bill to be passed.

Apr 22 2020,Immigration Suspended,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration-suspended,"From the Left

The left opposes the ban, arguing that immigration is beneficial to the economy and does not harm American workers.

“The coronavirus crisis is proving just how much we depend on immigrants… while immigrants constitute 17 percent of the U.S. workforce, they are ‘more than one in four doctors, nearly half the nation’s taxi drivers and chauffeurs and a clear majority of farm workers.’ Roughly a third of all nurses in California, New York and New Jersey — three of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus — are immigrants. In all… we rely on nearly 1.7 million foreign‐​born workers to provide medical and health care, 900,000 to grow our food, and 1.5 million more to deliver and distribute food and supplies…



“We are in desperate need of immigrants to fill both high-end and low-end jobs. The National Science Foundation reports that more than half of the United States’ doctorate holders in engineering, computer science and mathematics are foreign-born. These are the brainiacs whose innovations are powering our information economy… there is no justification for stopping the immigration process.”

Max Boot, Washington Post

“If there is something that will be needed more than ever to return unemployment to normal levels after the covid-19 pandemic ends, it is more, not less, immigration. Immigrants, roughly 15 percent of the U.S. population, are responsible for about a quarter of U.S. start-ups and patents each year, and that percentage has been increasing for decades. Moreover, through a number of different measures, we now know, too, that employment growth is faster for businesses started by immigrant entrepreneurs as opposed to those launched by the native-born over three- and six-year horizons…



“In the midst of an economic collapse that will more significantly affect small and medium enterprises (SMEs) than established large firms with enough cash flow and resources to survive, the policy prescription should go in line with creating an environment to boost the creation of productive SMEs that would foster competition within industries. Halting immigration, and with it business investment and creation, is doing exactly the opposite.”

Dany Bahar, Washington Post

“Is it reasonable to declare a short-term hiatus? Perhaps. But that has already been put into effect by the shuttering of government offices that process visa applications, by the restrictions on travel, and by the collapse of the labor market (economic migrants tend not to travel for jobs that don’t exist)… It’s no coincidence that his call for a ban on new immigrants dovetails with one of his signature campaign issues at a time when the vibrant economy he had planned to campaign on has cratered. This is about saving one job — the president’s.”

Editorial Board, Los Angeles Times

“Travel bans and closed consulates mean immigration is already at historic lows. Even if this wasn’t the case, the US has the most coronavirus cases in the world, and the job market is in ruins because a pandemic has shuttered many people inside their homes — not because of immigrants. So Trump’s immigration ban announcement was widely seen as an effort to toss some red meat to his base.”

Mar 28 2023,39 die after fire in immigration lockup in Mexico,The Oregonian,center,https://oregonlive.com/nation/2023/03/39-die-after-fire-in-immigration-lockup-in-mexico.html,"Migrants fearing deportation set mattresses ablaze at an immigration detention center in northern Mexico, starting a fire that left 39 dead, the president said Tuesday following one of the the deadliest incidents ever at an immigration lockup in the country.

Hours after the fire broke out late Monday, rows of bodies were laid out under shimmery silver sheets outside the facility in Ciudad Juarez, which is across from El Paso, Texas, and a major crossing point for migrants. Ambulances, firefighters and vans from the morgue swarmed the scene.

Thirty-nine people died and 29 were injured and are in “delicate-serious” condition, according to the National Immigration Institute. There were 68 men from Central and South America held in the facility at the time of the fire, the agency said. A Guatemalan official said many may have been from that Central American country.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the fire was started by migrants inside the facility in protest after learning they would be deported.

“They never imagined that this would cause this terrible misfortune,” López Obrador said, adding that the director of country’s immigration agency was on the scene.

Tensions between authorities and migrants had apparently been running high in recent weeks in Ciudad Juarez, where shelters are full of people waiting for opportunities to cross into the U.S. or who have requested asylum there and are waiting out the process.

More than 30 migrant shelters and other advocacy organizations published an open letter March 9 that complained of a criminalization of migrants and asylum seekers in the city. It accused authorities of abuse and using excessive force in rounding up migrants, complaining that municipal police were questioning people in the street about their immigration status without cause.

The high level of frustration in Ciudad Juarez was evident earlier this month when hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants acting on false rumors that the United States would allow them to enter the country tried to force their way across one of the international bridges to El Paso. U.S. authorities blocked their attempts.

The national immigration agency said Tuesday that it “energetically rejects the actions that led to this tragedy” without any further explanation of what those actions might have been.

In recent years, as Mexico has stepped up efforts to stem the flow migration to the U.S. border under pressure from the American government, the agency has struggled with overcrowding in its facilities. And the country’s immigration lockups have seen protests and riots from time to time.

Mostly Venezuelan migrants rioted inside an immigration center in Tijuana in October that had to be controlled by police and National Guard troops. In November, dozens of migrants rioted in Mexico’s largest detention center in the southern city of Tapachula near the border with Guatemala. No one died in either incident.

Mexico has emerged as the world’s third most popular destination for asylum-seekers, after the United States and Germany, but is still largely a transit country for those on the way to the U.S. It holds tens of thousands of migrants in an expansive network of detention centers and attempts to closely monitor movements across the country in cooperation with American authorities.

Karla Samayoa, spokeswoman for Guatemala’s Foreign Ministry, said that Mexican authorities had informed them that more than two dozen of the migrants who died appeared to be from the country.

Asylum-seekers must stay in the state where they apply in Mexico, resulting in large numbers being holed up near the country’s southern border with Guatemala. Tens of thousands are also in border cities with the U.S., including Ciudad Juarez.

The Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas at Austin has estimated there are more than 2,200 people in Ciudad Juarez’s shelters and more migrants outside shelters from Venezuela, Nicaragua, Colombia, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, and El Salvador.

Capital Bureau | USA TODAY NETWORK – FLORIDA

TALLAHASSEE – Gov. Ron DeSantis railed against President Joe Biden over the influx of migrants across the nation’s southern border before signing a new state law Wednesday imposing tough penalties and new restrictions on undocumented immigrants in Florida.

DeSantis, expected soon to announce his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, spoke in Jacksonville from a podium with a sign proclaiming, “Biden’s Border Crisis.”

The measure, approved last week by the Florida Legislature, has been condemned by critics as cruel and potentially leading to law enforcement profiling. It’s considered among the toughest steps taken by any state to deter illegal aliens from arriving.

“We have to stop this nonsense, this is not good for our country,” DeSantis said, adding “this is no way to run a government.”

A new surge of migrants is gathering at the U.S.-Mexico border in advance of the looming end of Title 42, a COVID pandemic policy that enabled authorities to quickly oust many migrants who entered the country without permission, rather than letting them stay while courts considered their cases.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

From USA TODAY:Biden says border will be `chaotic for a while' when Title 42 ends

Title 42 expires Thursday, as part of the end of the official COVID health emergency.

“We’re bracing for some turbulent times ahead,” DeSantis said. “And I think when you have a president who has turned a blind eye to what’s gone on at the border... you’re likely to see it get a lot worse. We’re protecting Floridians, to the full extent of our ability.”

The federal Department of Homeland Security has unveiled plans aimed at dealing with the border, post-Title 42, including setting up additional facilities along the border to process migrants, bolstering transportation and leaning on a fast-track deportation process.

Steps called cruel by advocates

But immigrant advocates said Florida’s approach targets with new criminal penalties and restrictions a community already struggling to survive. Immigrants, legal and illegal, represent a huge share of the state’s workforce, leaders added.

“The immigrant community in Florida is facing an unprecedented attack on our ability to live, work and take care of our families,” said Pastor Omar Johnson, a co-founder of Mission Talk, which is among faith and social service organizations united under the name, Evangelicos for Justice.

Evangelicos had urged DeSantis to veto the measure.

“This legislation would harm the immigrant community by placing unnecessary and cruel obstacles to participation in nearly every part of daily life,” he added.

The bill (CS/SB 1718) signed by DeSantis strengthens employment requirements and allows state law enforcement officials to conduct random audits of businesses suspected of hiring undocumented workers.

It also gives DeSantis an additional $12 million for a migrant relocation program similar to the one used by the governor last year to lure almost 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard off the Massachusetts coast.

More:Immigration checkpoints: Are there any in Florida?

That program already had $10 million set aside for it in a special legislative session earlier this year. Now, the state’s Division of Emergency Management under DeSantis has already selected three companies to carry out future rounds of migrant relocation.

Such relocations, also deployed by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, drop ill-prepared migrants in blue state enclaves in a clearly political move aimed at embarrassing Biden and other Democratic leaders who the GOP blames for the immigration crisis.

Voters say immigration system is broken

A recent poll conducted for the immigrant advocacy groups Immigration Hub and Voto Latino showed that more than eight-in-10 voters believe the immigration system is broken. But the measure is especially animating among Republican voters.

Under the new law, which takes effect July 1, criminal penalties are increased for human smuggling, with third-degree felony charges imposed on anyone caught “knowingly” and “willingly” transporting anyone illegally in the country across state lines into Florida.

Transporting a minor or more than five undocumented people into the state carries a second-degree felony penalty. Illegal migrants also could face felony charges by displaying a false ID to obtain employment.

In addition, all businesses with 25 or more employees would be required to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new workers.

'What are we going to do?'Two migrants share fears for the future in Florida crackdown

Under the legislation, local governments also would be banned from contributing money to organizations that create identification cards for undocumented immigrants and driver’s licenses issued to non-citizens in other states would be barred from use in Florida, a provision critics say may cause confusion and law enforcement profiling, especially in a diverse, visitor-filled state.

Hospitals receiving state and federal Medicaid reimbursements would be required to track how much money is spent on undocumented immigrants in emergency rooms.

Hospitals also would be required to ask patients about whether they are in the country legally, a standard opponents say will discourage many people from seeking health care – even those who have been living for years in Florida cities.

A 2014 law allowing undocumented immigrants to be admitted to practice law in Florida also would be repealed.

Republican supermajorities clear the way for DeSantis

Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate did balk at including a DeSantis call for repealing a 2014 law extending in-state tuition to “Dreamers,” undocumented students who grew up in Florida. But almost every other requirement, penalty or limit on undocumented immigrants that DeSantis had called for in February, also during an appearance in Jacksonville featuring the “Biden’s Border Crisis” placard, has been included in the legislation.

“This bill is politically driven and it’s an anti-immigrant bill that will hurt and even kill undocumented immigrants,” said Rep. Susan Valdes, D-Tampa, during debate on the legislation last week in the House.

The left opposes the executive order, arguing that immigrants are vital to the success of the US economy.

“Of all American-based Nobel Prize winners, over 40% have been immigrants… The most recent government data shows that in 2018 almost 135,000 scientific doctoral students, about 31% of the total, and over 20,000 postdoctoral researchers -- 53% of all scientific postgrad researchers -- were in the US on temporary visas…



“Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) pipelines have not been sufficient to kindle the interest of American students. While our educational system and colleges and universities need to do better at building the kind of talent we need, we have come to rely on immigrant ingenuity. Without their work, we risk both the intellectual and the economic decline of our academic scientific labs.”

Ushma S. Neill, CNN

“Tech executives tell me the order couldn’t come at a worse time… ‘My gut reaction was, I cannot believe that that the administration is doing this at this time,’ Doug Merritt, chief executive of the big data company Splunk, told me in an interview. Merritt warned the order could have a detrimental impact on innovation at a critical time during the pandemic, possibly impacting improving technology in health care… Amazon slammed the move as ‘short-sighted’…



“More than half of the top American tech companies were founded by immigrants or the children of immigrants, tech investor Mary Meeker said in her 2018 report on the future of the Internet.”

“The administration seems to be using the virus to justify an existing anti-immigration agenda, given that it was targeting people coming to the United States on temporary work visas before the coronavirus hit… ‘This is not a COVID-19 response or an economic response,’ Andrea Flores, deputy director of immigration policy for the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement following the announcement. ‘It’s the exploitation of a pandemic to institute divisive policies and reshape immigration law, while superseding Congress.’“

Noah Lanard, Mother Jones

“The new order also undermines the president’s repeated claims that he wants the most qualified foreigners, particularly international students, to contribute to the U.S. Even some of his allies highlighted the inconsistency: ‘Legal immigration is a positive for the American economy,’ Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote on Twitter. ‘Like all Americans, I want to recreate the strong economy we had before coronavirus… President Trump built it once and he can build it again, but not if the tools that helped create the strongest economy in generations are not available.’”

The growth comes as the federal government makes a push to address its labor shortage and manage a wave of retiring baby boomers by raising its 2025 immigration targets almost 25 percent.

During a townhall on the Upper West Side on Wednesday, a visibly frustrated Adams said the arrival of 110,000 border crossers and illegal aliens since the spring of last year will lead to the destruction of New York City as waves of illegal immigration have continued unabated under President Joe Biden’s watch.

“Let me tell you something New Yorkers: Never in my life have I had a problem that I did not see an ending to. I don’t see an ending to this. I don’t see an ending to this. This issue will destroy New York City, destroy New York City. We’re getting 10,000 migrants a month,” Adams said:

One time we were just getting Venezuela, now we’re getting Ecuador, now we’re getting Russian-speaking coming through Mexico, now we’re getting Western Africa, now we’re getting people from all over the globe have made their minds up that they’re going to come through the southern part of the border and come into New York City. [Emphasis added] And everyone is saying, ‘It’s New York City’s problem.’ Every community in this city is going to be impacted. We have a $12 billion deficit that we’re going to have to cut every service in this city is going to be impacted. All of us. [Emphasis added]

Adams said no New York City neighborhoods, from Staten Island to Queens, will be spared from illegal immigration.

“It’s going to come to your neighborhoods. All of us are going to be impacted by this,” Adams said. “I said it last year when we had 15,000. I’m telling you now with 110,000. The city we knew, we’re about to lose.”

The remarks come as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) has effectively cheered on illegal immigration to the region, suggesting repeatedly that it is a boon for employers who are looking to hire foreign workers.

Most recently, Hochul announced a workforce initiative to connect recently arrived border crossers and illegal aliens with employers.

Hochul, along with her corporate donors, is also lobbying the Biden administration for a federal bailout that would have American taxpayers subsidize housing, healthcare, and public transit for border crossers and illegal aliens in New York.

For New York City, illegal immigration is set to cost $12 billion by mid-2025.

New Mexico legislators rejected a proposal Tuesday to prohibit state and local government agencies from contracting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain immigrants as they seek asylum in the U.S.

The bill failed on a 17-21 vote of the state Senate. It also would have phased out local government participation in three-way agreements with private detention facilities and federal authorities.

The bill held implications for three privately operated detention facilities in New Mexico — and would have effectively ended migrant detention in early 2025 at the privately operated Otero County Processing Center at Chaparral in southern New Mexico on the outskirts of El Paso, Texas.

Legislatures in Colorado and New York are considering similar bills that would restrict local government contracts with federal immigration authorities or with private contractors through intergovernmental service agreements.

Proponents of the New Mexico bill highlighted reports of prison-like discipline, poor sanitation and suicide attempts at immigrant detention facilities, urging lawmakers to take action on humanitarian grounds.

“We’re talking here about those immigrants who’ve come into the country in accordance with our laws and applied for asylum,” said Democratic Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino of Albuquerque, cosponsor of the bill. “We found that many of them ... are being detained under conditions that are far from adequate.”

During debate, Republican senators downplayed the severity of living conditions at the Otero County migrant detention center run by Utah-based Management & Training Corporation and said that terminating the government contract there would deliver a serious financial blow to the community.

Republican state Sen. Ron Griggs, whose district includes the Otero County Processing Center, said Otero County borrowed money to build the migrant processing and detention center in 2007, hoping to eventually pay off bonds and create an enduring source of revenue to support public services.

He called the bill a “direct attack on facilities in some of our poorer rural areas.”

The Otero County Processing Center typically holds about 600 male and female migrants.

Five Democratic senators joined with Republicans to defeat the bill. Four other Democratic senators were excused or absent from the vote.

Griggs also argued that a local detention ban in New Mexico wouldn’t necessarily improve conditions for migrants who wind up at detention centers in other states awaiting asylum proceedings.

Jazmin Irazoqui-Ruiz, senior attorney with New Mexico Immigration Law Center, disputed that and said migrants might be released out of cost considerations to live temporarily with relatives or other sponsors, or find themselves transferred to states such as Colorado that take a different approach by underwriting legal representation for indigent immigrants.

In recent years, California, Illinois and New Jersey have enacted legislation aimed at reining in migrant detention centers within their territory."
Jan 30 2020,Immigration Restrictions,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration-restrictions,"Finally, regarding the rule targeting ‘birth tourism,’ “The administration hasn’t clarified how a consular officer would have any ‘reason to believe’ that an applicant will imminently give birth. Since they can’t ask outright, they might infer based on looks alone, which has no basis in immigration law, said Ur Jaddou, former chief counsel at US Citizenship and Immigration Services and the director of the watchdog group DHS Watch… “More broadly, the policy could impose new hurdles on anyone of childbearing age. Since some B visas are valid for up to 10 years, a consular officer could theoretically weigh whether someone is likely to give birth over the course of the next decade. A 30-year-old, married applicant could therefore suddenly face more scrutiny, without any means of recourse or appeal… Imposing these kinds of disproportionate burdens runs afoul of the US Constitution, which protects against sex discrimination. But since these consular interviews involve noncitizens and are taking place on foreign soil, the US Constitution doesn’t protect them .” Anna North, Nicole Narea, and Alex Ward, Vox

Regarding Gorsuch’s opinion, “It wasn’t so long ago that liberals tended to rail against [nationwide] injunctions as conservatives eagerly sought them from federal district judges… Now the shoe is often on the other foot. The Trump administration announces a policy that is anathema to Democrats, a liberal litigant files a lawsuit, and a judge somewhere in the country issues a nationwide injunction blocking that policy… “It’s working in Democrats’ favor — for now. But in the long term, nationwide injunctions are likely to be a much bigger thorn in the side of Democratic presidents than they are for Republican presidents. The Supreme Court, after all, is controlled by Republicans. So liberal nationwide injunctions tend to be wiped away quickly, while conservative injunctions may last forever… Now is the time for the court’s liberals to form an alliance with Gorsuch .” Ian Millhiser, Vox

Some, however, argue that the rule “is not, contrary to many comments, a drastic change in immigration policy. Like much that is Trumpian, the new rules, and the Supreme Court order allowing them to go forward, build logically on the last few decades of the American political conversation on immigration, race, and class… “The ‘public charge’ exclusion in immigration law goes back to the middle of the nineteenth century… The immediate precursor of the Trump Administration rule is the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, the welfare-reform law signed by Bill Clinton, in 1996… Trump’s spin on these long-standing policies and fears takes them to an entirely new level of hatred and cruelty. But, t o reverse them, we will have to do much more than return to the way things were before Trumpism .” Masha Gessen, New Yorker

“Under the new rules, even legal immigrants who haven't yet received any public assistance but are determined to be ‘more likely than not’ to do so at some point in their lifetimes could be denied entry into the U.S. or denied permission to remain as permanent residents. This gives enormous discretion to officials in determining who is a ‘public charge.’ One Trump administration guidance includes any immigrant whose current family income is below 125 percent of the federal poverty level. Of course, such a criterion would result in [racially] disparate impacts, as many immigrants of color come from nations with low wage levels… “Nothing in the Supreme Court's decision addresses the merits or the morality of Trump's immigration policy. This decision was entirely a matter of legal jurisdiction, as the conservative justices saw it. They derided the idea of district courts imposing nationwide injunctions on Trump administration policy… ‘What in this gamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?’ Gorsuch asked… [But] true chaos is caused not by the technicalities of judicial review but by an administration that is attempting to radically disrupt determinations that have guided immigration policy for more than a century.” Sophia Tesfaye, Salon

“[The rule will] exclude a large number of immigrants seeking entry from abroad, who face the daunting task of proving total self-sufficiency, not just now but indefinitely. This extraordinary burden might be legally tolerable if Congress had demanded it. But Congress did no such thing. Instead, the Senate refused to implement a version of the new rule as recently as 2013. But Trump’s Department of Homeland Security would not let a little thing like congressional inaction stand in the way of its nativist goals… “The 5–4 decision is both a humanitarian catastrophe and an act of rank hypocrisy : The same conservative justices who rail against executive lawmaking by federal bureaucrats approved a policy written by bureaucrats that radically alters the laws passed by Congress.” Mark Joseph Stern, Slate

From the Right

The right is generally supportive of both the public charge rule and the restrictions on birth tourism.

The right is generally supportive of both the public charge rule and the restrictions on birth tourism.

Dated But Relevant: The public charge rule “is a long-standing principle of U.S. immigration law, first implemented at the federal level in 1882. It is common sense — and a smart choice in the best interests of the country as a whole — to try to ensure that new, legal immigrants to our country are self-sufficient individuals who will be a net plus for our economy, rather than a drag on expensive medical, housing, welfare, and other public assistance programs paid for by the American taxpayer at both the state and federal level…



“The administration’s new rules simply define the public charge requirement to reflect today’s system of government benefits.”

Hans von Spakovsky and David Inserra, Heritage Foundation

Nevertheless, “We ought not overstate the problem or pretend that immigrants rather than the native-born drive the costs of these social programs… It’s true that immigrants are more likely to be poor. But among poor people in the U.S., it turns out that immigrants aren’t the drain on public services that the administration is making them out to be… [According to a study by the Cato Institute] the native-born make use of means-tested welfare and entitlement programs at significantly higher rates than their foreign-born counterparts…



“[Furthermore] the assumption that people who arrive poor will stay that way is ahistorical. Immigrants are self-selecting. The poorest of the poor can’t afford the trip, and the ones who do come tend to be more motivated and less risk-averse than nonimmigrants. Class-warfare liberals have been insisting in recent years that social mobility in [America] is now a ‘myth.’ I’ll believe that when people no longer want to come here.”

Jason L. Riley, Wall Street Journal

The decision’s “real import is the way Justice Neil Gorsuch puts a torch to the proliferation of universal injunctions by the lower courts. His concurrence, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, is a much-needed rebuke to what he calls ‘the increasingly common practice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the cases before them’…



“Justice Gorsuch doesn’t point out, as he might have, that these [injunctions] have become rife in the last three years as judges seek to block Trump policy even at the risk of being overturned on appeal. But he lays out the many legal, and practical, problems with rule-by-injunction. ‘By their nature, universal injunctions tend to force judges into making rushed, high-stakes, low-information decisions,’ he writes. They encourage forum shopping as plaintiffs file suit in several of the 94 federal district courts and 12 appellate courts to stop a policy. ‘A single loss and the policy goes on ice,’ he says. ‘What’s in this gamesmanship and chaos can we be proud of?’”

Editorial Board, Wall Street Journal

Regarding birth tourism, “[The new rule] addresses a real, if hard to quantify, problem. Some companies openly advertise birth-tourism services abroad, and there have been numerous cases in which providers of these services have resorted to fraud and other illegal activities. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates births to women on tourist visas at 33,000 annually…



“The rule still allows pregnant women to come for the purpose of giving birth in U.S. hospitals for medical reasons, so long as they are doing so because of the quality of care and proximity to their home countries — and didn’t, for example, select the U.S. over another destination because doing so would win the child citizenship… Like much of our immigration policy, it depends on consular officers’ asking hard questions and judging the truthfulness of the replies… But as far as the rule goes, it’s entirely correct: If the primary purpose of someone’s visit is to give birth in the U.S. and gain citizenship for the child, that person should not be given a B visa.”

The Editors, National Review

“Consular officers have every right to ask about medical conditions from both males and females. For instance, they have a duty to try to determine if someone who wants to come to the United States is sick. They ask about financial status. They ask about criminal intent. And they have the right to ask about a pregnancy when it’s suspected someone is using our visa program to cheat our system. No foreign citizen has an unrestricted right to come here.”

Jun 26 2023,DeSantis unveils an aggressive immigration and border security policy that largely mirrors Trump’s,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/desantis-border-immigration-republican-president-policy-33e73877fe029705ca6c8246f97a560d,"EAGLE PASS, Texas (AP) — Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis promised to end birthright citizenship, finish building the southern border wall and send U.S. forces into Mexico to combat drug cartels as part of an aggressive — and familiar — immigration policy proposal he laid out Monday in a Texas border city.

The sweeping plan, the Florida governor’s first detailed policy release as a 2024 contender, represents a long-established wish list of Republican immigration proposals that largely mirrors former President Donald Trump’s policies. Much of DeSantis’ plan faces tall odds, requiring the reversal of legal precedents, approval from other countries or even an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Still, DeSantis projected confidence on Monday, excoriating leaders in both political parties for failing to stop what he called an immigrant “invasion.” He addressed his plans while touring Eagle Pass, a community that has emerged as a major corridor for illegal border crossings during Joe Biden’s presidency.

“I have listened to people in D.C. for years and years and years, going back decades — Republicans and Democrats — always chirping about this yet never actually bringing the issue to a conclusion,” DeSantis told an audience of roughly 100 residents, including local Democratic officials, school teachers and mothers of children lost to fentanyl overdoses. “What we’re saying is no excuses on this.”

He likened illegal border crossings to home break-ins and warned that drug traffickers trying to bring their product into the United States could wind up “stone cold dead.”

“If somebody were breaking into your house to do something bad, you would respond with force. Yet why don’t we do that at the southern border?” DeSantis asked. “So if the cartels are cutting through the border wall, trying to run product into this country, they’re going to end up stone cold dead as a result of that bad decision.

“And if you do that one time, you’re not going to see them mess with our wall ever again,” he said.

The DeSantis campaign has promised to release more detailed policy rollouts in the coming weeks. But in leading with immigration, the two-term Florida governor is prioritizing a divisive issue that has long been a focus of the GOP’s most conservative voters. The pro-immigrant group America’s Voice condemned DeSantis for making “invasion” references that have been used by white supremacists.

Yet voters in the political middle have warmed to more aggressive immigration policies in recent months as illegal border crossing surged. Overall, 6 in 10 adults in the U.S. disapprove of Biden’s handling of immigration, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.

Still, it may be difficult for DeSantis to separate himself on immigration from the many other Republicans seeking the 2024 presidential nomination — especially Trump, the front-runner.

That didn’t stop him from trying.

Speaking from a podium emblazoned with the words, “No Excuses” and “Stop the Invasion,” DeSantis noted that there were more immigrants deported in the first four years of the Obama administration than in Trump’s first term.

He made repeated references to the unfinished border wall, an indirect knock on the former president, who is now his chief rival in the crowded Republican presidential primary. Trump tried and ultimately failed to finish a border wall along the entire 1,950-mile (3,140-kilometer) U.S.-Mexico border during his four years in office.

Before the Monday announcement, the DeSantis campaign released new merchandise bearing the words, “Build The Wall. No Excuses.”

Trump apparently watched DeSantis on television, describing his trip to the border as “a total waste of time.”

“He is a failed candidate, whose sole purpose in making the trip was to reiterate the fact that he would do all of the things done by me in creating the strongest Border, by far, in U.S. history,” Trump wrote on social media.

The fierce feud between Trump and DeSantis, which includes clashes over policy and personality, will continue on Tuesday as both men are scheduled to campaign in New Hampshire. But immigration has been central to their messages no matter where they are.

Trump emphasized immigration while delivering the keynote address to hundreds of enthusiastic religious conservatives at the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s conference in Washington over the weekend. He promised to carry out “the largest domestic deportation operation on the border” and boasted about completing more than 300 miles (or 480 kilometers) of wall along the southern border during his administration while promising to build even more should he win another term.

Trump’s policies worked to constrict immigration, but the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border still swelled during his time in office before dropping during the COVID-19 pandemic.

And his policies caused clogs in the system that led to massive overcrowding; for instance, the immigration court case backlog alone grew from roughly 500,000 in June 2016 to 1.3 million cases by the end of 2020. There were massive human rights concerns, too, particularly with the Remain in Mexico program and the separation of children from their families at the border.

Facing reporters on Monday, DeSantis said he would be more “aggressive” than Trump in implementing strong immigration policies if elected president.

“I think a lot of the things he’s saying, you know, I agree with,” he said of Trump. “But I also think those are the same things that were said back in 2016.”

Like Trump, DeSantis vowed to end the practice, as outlined in the Constitution, that grants citizenship to all babies born on U.S. soil. The 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside.”

DeSantis promises to end the United States’ so-called catch-and-release policy, which currently allows for the release of immigrants in the country illegally until their court dates. That’s because federal immigration authorities have the money for just 30,000 beds, making it impossible to detain everyone who is arrested.

DeSantis also wants to reinstitute the Remain in Mexico policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Such a plan would need Mexico’s approval.

He’s calling for closing the “Flores loophole,” which, among other things, requires families to generally be released from custody in 20 days. It is part of a federal court order, so it’s unclear how he could close it.

DeSantis is also promising to use military force against drug cartels if necessary. He would “reserve the right to operate across the border to secure our territory from Mexican cartel activities,” according to the plan, which also calls for the U.S. Navy and the Coast Guard to block precursor chemicals from entering Mexican ports if “the Mexican government won’t stop cartel drug manufacturing.”

DeSantis’ plan says little about the millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally, aside from promising to deport those who have overstayed their visas. Deporting such people has been a challenge that has eluded authorities for decades.

In September, the small border city of Eagle Pass made international headlines when nine people drowned in their attempt to swim through the Rio Grande.

DeSantis was supportive of one audience member who suggested that the situation at the border constituted an “act of war.”

“I think the state of Texas has the right to declare an invasion,” DeSantis told the man. “You’re going to see as president under Article 2 of the Constitution, you have a responsibility and a duty to protect the country. We are going to do that and we are going to do that robustly.”

Jul 23 2023,"Canadian immigration policy luring tech workers should be a warning to U.S., lawyers say",CBC News,left,https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-immigration-tech-workers-1.6914675,"The popularity of a new Canadian program meant to attract American tech workers north of the border should serve as a warning to U.S. immigration officials and lawmakers, American immigration lawyers say.

Earlier this week, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada opened up an application portal for immigrants in the United States who hold H1-B visas that allow them to work in the tech industry there.

The portal was designed to draw these visa holders to Canada on three-year open work permits. It worked — the program reached its 10,000-applicant cap within two days.

""It's a smart move by Canada. They see a need to fill in their own economy and available workers who are not being properly used ... by the United States,"" said Sharvari Dalal-Dheini, head of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

""This [policy] was really directly targeted at our program and our failures at our program, and really giving an opportunity to H1-B workers who may not have that opportunity in the United States anymore.""

Sharvari Dhalal-Deini of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said Canada's policy is a smart move that takes advantage of the United States' failure to reform its immigration policies. (Submitted)

Up to 600,000 immigrants in the States may hold H1-B visas. These documents are directly tied to employment and immigration advocates there say they provide poor pathways to permanent residency.

An H1-B holder in the U.S. who loses their job would have to leave the country within 60 days — unless they find new employment within that time period.

Dhalal-Deini said immigration advocates in the U.S. have been asking for reform of the immigration system for years, but lawmakers are stuck in a political deadlock over the issue.

""It's a big talking point for the [political] parties to say, 'Oh we support immigration,'"" she said — but undocumented migration from Mexico has turned the idea of reforming immigration policy into a highly partisan brawl.

""At the very least, Canadians have brought to light the fact that there are other, smarter countries with better immigration policies that actually value science, technology, engineering and math,"" said immigration lawyer Ashwin Sharma of the Sharma Law Office in Jacksonville, Fla.

""Perhaps the U.S. will start doing the same.""

Will the tech workers coming to Canada stay here?

Sharma also acknowledged that the open nature of the Canadian work permit, coupled with the higher salaries generally on offer in U.S. tech industries, may mean that not all applicants are looking to move to Canada on a long-term basis.

""It could be that the H1-B workers are coming over for a short period of time to perhaps kill off some unemployment period of time,"" he said.

""It remains to be seen how many will remain in Canada.""

He said the speed with which the program hit its application cap is still remarkable.

Immigration Minister Sean Fraser said Canada has other advantages that make up for lower salaries.

""Tech workers who are here on a work permit have a unique opportunity to transition to permanent residency,"" he said.

He said his department would follow up on the application process over the next few months before deciding whether it would expand this policy or others — part of what he calls Canada's ""digital nomad"" strategy.

""We're going to want to see whether people are in fact landing jobs in the sector with companies who are looking to experience growth,"" Fraser said.

The minister said he expects to see the first applicants arrive in Canada this summer or fall.

He said he has not heard from U.S. immigration officials since starting the program.

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to a CBC News request for comment.

The Canadian online portal has faced criticism for glitches that prevented some applicants from completing their entries.

Fraser said the government will address those problems if it decides to relaunch the program."

“The city is being destroyed by the migrant crisis,” Adams said during a panel discussion at the African American Mayors Association Conference in Washington, D.C.

Earlier in the week, Adams pointed out the massive cost of dealing with the situation.

The city is already out $817 million because of it, said Jacques Jiha, his budget director. And it’s staring down a $1.4 billion price tag for the fiscal year that ends June 30. There’s also a looming $2.9 billion for the next year, not to mention the impending lapse of Title 42, a restrictive Trump-era immigration policy. Adams said it’s still unclear why the federal government — the White House in particular — hasn’t allocated more dollars to help the city respond to the crisis, which he insisted would help stave off cuts at the local level that are drumming up controversy around City Hall. “The president and the White House have failed this city,” he said, adding that a less-than-punctual state budget is only adding to the stresses.

Jun 23 2023,Top US court rules Biden immigration enforcement policy can stand,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/23/top-us-court-rules-biden-immigration-enforcement-policy-can-stand,"The United States Supreme Court has ruled to uphold an immigration policy set by the administration of President Joe Biden, which narrowed the scope of those prioritised for deportation.

The ruling on Friday addressed a challenge brought by Texas and Louisiana, two states that argued the more relaxed enforcement would encourage migration and thus stretch their resources thin.

The Biden administration has argued that, with an estimated 11 million people living in the US without documentation, it is common for presidential administrations to set enforcement priorities.

Under the Biden policy, authorities were ordered to prioritise apprehending and deporting non-US citizens deemed to be a threat to national security, public safety or border security. Those who had lived in the US over the long term without issue were de-prioritised.

Announced shortly after Biden took office in 2021, the approach represented a departure from the hardline enforcement policies pursued by former President Donald Trump.

The Southern Poverty Law Center, a legal and rights advocacy group, called the ruling was a “welcome step in the process to reimagine our immigration enforcement priorities”.

“Immigrants of all nationalities, backgrounds and walks of life are contributing members of our communities,” said Efrén Olivares, deputy legal director of the organisation’s Immigrant Justice Project, in a statement. “With finite resources, the federal agencies tasked with enforcing immigration laws should be allowed to set common-sense, reasonable and lawful priorities.”

A federal judge in Texas had previously ruled in favour of Texas and Louisiana and briefly suspended the Biden administration policy.

The Supreme Court’s 8-1 ruling, however, said the states did not have the authority to make the challenge. The states had alleged the federal government was making insufficient arrests or prosecutions in cases of irregular migration.

Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that lawsuits “run up against” the authority of the executive branch to enforce federal law.

“The executive branch — not the judiciary — makes arrests and prosecutes offenses on behalf of the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote.

Conservative Justice Samuel Alito was the sole dissent in the case.

In a separate immigration-related ruling on Friday, the Supreme Court also rejected a challenge to a federal law that makes it illegal to “encourage or induce” a non-citizen to enter the country irregularly.

The 7-2 ruling invalidated a lower-court decision that said the law was unconstitutional. It had been challenged on free speech grounds.

“Properly interpreted, this provision forbids only the intentional solicitation or facilitation of certain unlawful acts. It does not ‘prohibit a substantial amount of protected speech’ — let alone enough to justify throwing out the law’s ‘plainly legitimate sweep’,” conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote in the majority opinion.

Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.

Biden has faced Republican criticism for his immigration policies since taking office. The issue is expected to factor prominently in the upcoming 2024 elections.

Still, while Biden has generally softened enforcement for undocumented people already living in the US, rights groups have criticised his border policies.

In May, the Biden administration implemented new measures that made many migrants and refugees arriving at the US border with Mexico ineligible to seek asylum. The rule requires most asylum seekers to apply first in the countries they pass through or get pre-approval via the government-administered CBP One app.

Rights groups called the policy, which contained some exceptions, a return to a similar “safe third country” rule imposed under the Trump administration. Such policies, they argued, fly in the face of the US’s asylum obligations under international law and force migrants to seek more dangerous routes to enter the country.

The Biden administration has said the policy has so far proven effective, resulting in a steep drop in irregular border crossings since going into effect."
Sep 21 2022,Both Parties Are to Blame for the Immigration Crisis,Jonah Goldberg,right,https://thedispatch.com/p/both-parties-are-to-blame-for-the,"When it comes to immigration, and especially at this moment in our politics, I’m a “bothsides-er.” These days, complaining about both sides—Democrats and Republicans—invites a lot of scorn and ridicule, usually from people on one side. On some issues that scorn might be deserved. But on immigration, I am happy to seethe with contempt on the sidelines.

Consider the brouhaha over Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sending 50 migrants to the tiny liberal enclave of Martha’s Vineyard. I’m against using poor, desperate people as political props. The fact that DeSantis may have misled some migrants about what they were signing up for is even worse—though cries of “human trafficking” and “kidnapping” strike me as ridiculous, partisan-fueled nonsense.

DeSantis’ cynical stunt did everything he hoped it would. He upped the ante on Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has been sending busloads of (apparently consenting) migrants to liberal cities like New York and Chicago. Abbott’s efforts have a high quotient of “owning the libs” to them as well, as he has not coordinated with local officials, preferring to drop them off by surprise, most recently at Vice President Kamala Harris’ residence. Arizona’s Gov. Doug Ducey, another Republican, has been more responsible, coordinating with local officials to ensure migrants find support when they get off the bus.

But it was DeSantis’ move that sent Democrats and much of the media into a frenzy of outrage—which is exactly what he wanted. No wonder Donald Trump is reportedly furious that DeSantis is stealing the limelight from him. I will be surprised if DeSantis doesn’t get a bump in the polls among Republicans. Many Democrats won’t be surprised either, because they’ve convinced themselves that “the cruelty is the point” of Republican policies.

What neither side will admit—even after the furor over the Martha’s Vineyard stunt dies down—is that immigration is a very hard problem. But we have two parties dominated by voices that claim otherwise. On one side are the Republicans who agree it’s a problem, just not a very hard one. Simply build a wall, close the border, and deport those who are here. On the other side are the Democrats who have trouble admitting that immigration is a problem at all.

Just last week, Harris insisted “the border is secure.” You don’t have to be a partisan Republican to find that insulting to your intelligence. In the last 11 months, nearly 2 million migrants have been apprehended at the border. Thousands of migrants have died on both sides of the border precisely because they rightly believe it’s not secure. A majority of Americans—including 4 in 10 Democrats—believe it’s at least partly true that America is “experiencing an invasion.” That sounds like a problem to me.

Whether you dislike their tactics or not, DeSantis and the GOP have a legitimate point. For years, Democratic politicians, particularly mayors of “sanctuary cities,” have pandered to immigration activists by proclaiming “no one is illegal” and everyone is welcome and that people who complain about immigration are just bigots who can’t handle diversity. Obviously, some bigoted Republicans have made such charges very easy for Democrats.

But New York Mayor Eric Adams made it seem like his city was overwhelmed by a humanitarian crisis when some 6,000 migrants were bused up from Texas over the course of weeks. Texas gets almost that many every few days. Moreover, the federal government has been transporting migrants around the country for years under the Obama, Trump, and Biden administrations—for administrative and security purposes.

When DeSantis and Abbot do this, the media calls it an outrage, and yes, it’s meant to spark outrage—but it also calls attention to a national crisis. If you tuned in to media reports, you’d think the crisis is what Republicans are doing with a tiny number of migrants, not the millions of migrants who’ve been arriving at the border for years.

We got to this point because about a decade ago, both parties decided it was in their interest to have the issue to rally around rather than solve the problem via some compromise. Both parties benefited from demonizing the other and both shared the same faulty assumption that Latinos were somehow destined to vote for Democrats. Both sides have preferred to exploit the dysfunction they caused.

For years, when asked what my preferred immigration policy would be, my standard answer has been “to have one.” I agree with Sen. Elizabeth Warren when she says, “It is cruel to treat human beings like pawns in a political game.” But that is precisely what Republicans and Democrats have been doing for a long time."

Apr 24 2020,Immigration Hawks Unhappy With Details Inside Trump’s Immigration ‘Ban,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/22/immigration-ban-failed-donald-trump-coronavirus/,"President Donald Trump will soon sign an immigration “ban” that will largely limit the number of foreign nationals allowed into the United States for the next 60 days.

The details of the order came after the president teased an immigration ban on Twitter, saying action needed to be taken while millions of Americans are left out of work from the coronavirus pandemic.

However, the order leaves major exemptions for guest workers and others, leaving some immigration hawks disappointed and arguing more needs to be done.

The executive order placing limits on immigration into the United States has many immigration hawks disappointed, arguing that the order will not do enough to protect American workers.

President Donald Trump excited his conservative base when he announced late Monday that he would be signing an executive order to ban immigration amid a dramatic economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. However, when more details about the order were revealed the following day, it seemed that the order had more bark than bite.

The president said Tuesday that the upcoming order will block foreign nationals for 60 days from obtaining a permanent residency visa, otherwise known as a green card.

However, the order will not stop the federal government from processing hundreds of thousands of temporary employees. Exceptions are also expected to be made for essential employees — such as those in the health care industry — and migrants who enter the United States via immediate family members.

The carve-outs were not well received by immigration hardliners.

“That’s an awful lot of exceptions,” Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Tuesday shortly after the president’s press briefing. “So if the point of this executive order was to protect American jobs — maybe there was another point, but if it was to protect American jobs, it failed.”

This sentiment was echoed elsewhere in circles that favor less immigration into the United States.

Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said it would be “absurd” to continue immigration at record levels when 15% of the workforce is losing their jobs. The order would limit some immigration, but not a lot, he said.

“The reason it’s not going to have that much effect isn’t only because it excludes guest workers — that’s part of it. Also, since most green card recipients already live and work in the United States under some other status, it’s not going to have that much effect,” he told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

Krikorian surmised that after former Attorney General-turned-Alabama Senate candidate Jeff Sessions went on Tucker Carlson’s show and became the first to propose an immigration ban amid the coronavirus pandemic, Trump was spurred to issue a similar decree.

Pressure to limit foreign workers came as roughly 22 million U.S. citizens have lost work due to coronavirus-induced lockdowns across the country.

However, as the administration scrambled to come up with a solution, the pro-business faction of the White House clashed with the administration’s immigration hawks, and Trump’s Monday night tweet is believed to have been an action to force the two sides to finally reach a consensus.

While the order falls short of a blanket ban, other pro-enforcement figures say the order is better than nothing.

“I think the decision was good,” former ICE chief Tom Homan told the DCNF. “[Trump] said during his briefing that there’s going to be room for expansion as we move down the road. He should,” he said, adding that guest workers should be included in the order.

Homan continued: “It was a great decision because it’s going to save some jobs, but if he’s going to expand it, he needs to expand it to non-immigrants.”

While lauding the Trump administration for the order, the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) said a “wholesale” moratorium would be the most ideal approach while so many U.S. citizens are out of a job.

“The administration is to be commended for its efforts to help displaced American citizens looking for work,” Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel of IRLI, told the DCNF.

“The reality is that temporary guest workers, whether through H-1B visas or other programs, are exploited by employers as a source of cheap labor to undercut American workers. A wholesale suspension of foreign worker programs would be most effective to help Americans looking for work,” Wilcox said.

It’s still not entirely clear what will be inside Trump’s executive order, and he has also teased a second one down the road. The upcoming order is set to last for 60 days, and can be renewed.

However, immigration experts noted that, even when the United States lifts the lockdown orders that are in place, many Americans won’t simply be able to return to the jobs they once had. The economy has been deeply affected, and the ramifications could last for years.

“The economy isn’t going to be up and running like it was before,” Krikorian said. “This is going to be years to re-absorb the millions who have been thrown out of work back into a very different-looking economy.”

“Millions of people had jobs that are not going to exist. It doesn’t mean that the world ends, it just means that the process of re-integrating tens of millions of people thrown out of work by this virus is going to be a project of years, and not months,” he said.

Jun 19 2019,Immigration Crackdown,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/immigration-crackdown,"From the Left

The left opposes increased deportations but does not believe ICE is capable of carrying them out, and argues that the outrage against Ocasio-Cortez is obscuring the real issue.

“One of the first immigration actions Trump took as president was to eliminate a system of priorities President Barack Obama created for deportations. The system prioritized the deportation of people with serious criminal records or who otherwise posed a threat to public safety, and its creation was an acknowledgement by the Obama administration that it’s simply not possible to deport the 11 million people who live in the United States without proper legal documents… “By all measures, a plan to deport ‘millions’ of people is an astounding exaggeration — even beginning to deport millions, as Trump pledged ICE would do, stretches the truth to a breaking point… ICE has deported an average of 90,000 people from the interior of the United States in recent years. The largest number of people ICE deported overall — from the interior as well as recent border crossers — was about 420,000 people in 2012.”

Maryam Saleh, The Intercept

“More to the point, perhaps, doing so would necessarily entail shattering large numbers of families, including ones well established over a decade or more of residency and whose children, born in this country, are citizens. As Mr. Trump and his administration discovered a year ago, Americans are rightly appalled at the sight of government agents wrenching apart parents and their children; they would likely react just as badly to a rerun involving their neighbors as they did to the original iteration, in which agents focused on families who had recently crossed the border.”

Editorial Board, Washington Post

“Trump tweeted about ‘the millions of illegal aliens… they will be removed as fast as they come in.’ This does not make sense. The asylum seekers at the border cannot be immediately removed because they have a legal right to apply for humanitarian relief… What we see here is a chief executive who is well aware of his vulnerability to a Democratic challenger, desperately trying to rile up his followers by bashing immigrants. After several years of draconian immigration policies and optics, including images of children separated from their families and kept in pens, it is unlikely to persuade voters in 2020.”

Raul A. Reyes, CNN

“Trump seems convinced that draconian immigration policy is good politics. But evidence is mounting that he’s wrong… a Fox News poll released this week indicates that Trump’s fixation on curtailing all forms of immigration isn’t resonating with voters. Half of American voters who responded to the poll said they think the Trump administration has gone too far with immigration enforcement — more than double the percentage who said they don’t think Trump has gone far enough… It’s unclear whether his announcement was meant as anything beyond an empty show of strength. But either way, the mere fact that Trump views using the power of the state against immigrants and their communities as a winning reelection strategy is a dark omen 15 months ahead of the next presidential election.”

Aaron Rupar, Vox

“The administration’s efforts at deterring asylum families through displays of toughness and force have failed spectacularly, because they are fleeing conditions at home that are also terrible. There is a legitimate policy dispute here — Trump wants to detain families for far longer, so they can’t evade hearings, while Democrats favor addressing root causes of migrations and reforms to humanely manage the influx — but one thing that’s inescapable is that toughness as deterrence has been unmasked as total folly.”

Greg Sargent, Washington Post

Regarding Ocasio-Cortez's comment, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) tweeted, “One of the lessons from the Holocaust is ‘Never Again’ - not only to mass murder, but also to the dehumanization of people, violations of basic rights, and assaults on our common morality. We fail to learn that lesson when we don’t callout such inhumanity right in front of us.”

FLORIDA — LGBTQ and immigration advocacy groups have joined the NAACP in issuing a travel warning for Florida.



Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, warns visitors “of the risks posed to the health, safety and freedom of those considering short- or long-term travel or relocation to the state,” according to a news release. “The move comes in response to a wave of safety inquiries Equality Florida has received following the passage of laws that are hostile to the LGBTQ community, restrict access to reproductive health care, repeal gun safety laws, foment racial prejudice, and attack public education by banning books and censoring curriculum,” the organization said.

Also Read: Transgender People Called 'Demons,' 'Imps,' 'Mutants' By FL Lawmaker The Florida Immigrant Coalition, a statewide immigrant rights coalition of 65 member organizations and more than 100 allies, also issued an emergency travel advisory this week, urging visitors “to reconsider travel to Florida due to unconstitutional laws targeted at immigrant communities which abuse civil liberties.” According to the coalition’s advisory poster, “Every county in Florida represents a high risk of unlawful detainment and potential family separation.”

At a statewide conference in Orlando last month, NAACP member organizations unanimously supported a recommendation to the national NAACP board to issue a travel advisory to Florida because of state policies and “anti-Black legislation,” according to News Nation. The suggested travel advisory is a response to a push by Gov. Ron DeSantis to ban diversity and inclusion initiatives in schools and the workplace, as well the banning of a new AP African American studies course from the College Board, among other policies, reports said.

DeSantis called the travel warning “a joke” and “a stunt,” according to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune. ""Our country, you know, it goes through all these — we get involved in these stupid fights,"" the governor said. ""This is a stunt to try to do that. It's a pure stunt, and fine if you want to waste your time on a stunt, that's fine. Look, I mean, I'm not wasting my time on your stunts. Okay. I'm gonna make sure that we're getting good things done here. And we're gonna continue to make this state a great state.""

“We fought very hard to get diversity, to get inclusion,” Isaiah Rumlin, NAACP Jacksonville chapter president, told News4Jax. “We fought very hard for voting rights. All of these policies and laws are trying to revert back to where we were in the past.” ""The recommendation from our Florida State Conference is a clear indication of just how egregious Governor DeSantis' actions are. Any attempt to intentionally erase or misrepresent Black History is a direct attack on the foundation of comprehensive education,” Leon W. Russell, Florida NAACP board chair, said in a statement after the vote. ""Be clear — Black history is American history. We are proud of our Florida State Conference for meeting this moment with the equal aggression and intention that is a necessary response to these attacks. Any location in America where our history has been erased does not offer us, or our children, a bright future."" The national NAACP board will begin its review of the suggested travel advisory, submitted as a resolution by the Florida board, in May, according to a news release from the organization. In an email to supporters, Nadine Smith, Equality Florida’s executive director, referred to recent laws passed in the Sunshine State and other decisions made by state officials as “Gov. DeSantis’ Slate of Hate.”

According to Equality Florida’s travel warning, these include:

the passage of a six-week abortion ban,

moves to strip diversity, equity and inclusion programs at colleges and universities,

book challenges and bans in classrooms,

the prohibition of classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity,

the repeal of gun safety laws and

policies banning access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. “As an organization that has spent decades working to improve Florida’s reputation as a welcoming and inclusive place to live work and visit, it is with great sadness that we must respond to those asking if it is safe to travel to Florida or remain in the state as the laws strip away basic rights and freedoms,” Smith said. “While losing conferences, and top students who have written off Florida threatens lasting damage to our state, it is most heartbreaking to hear from parents who are selling their homes and moving because school censorship, book bans and health care restrictions have made their home state less safe for their children.”"

Ron DeSantis, dozens of immigrants were bused from the Texas border area to Los Angeles and dropped off on Wednesday, June 14, at downtown’s Union Station, at the behest of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, prompting a swift rebuke from L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, who slammed the action as a “cheap” political stunt using humans as “pawns.”

All told, 42 immigrants — among them said to be eight children, including babies and toddlers — were dropped off at the depot, said Jorge-Mario Cabrera, director of communications for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA). They were taken to St. Anthony’s Croatian Catholic Church in nearby Chinatown, where they were expected to stay the night. Los Angeles Fire Department crews responded to ensure none of them had any medical issues.

Cabrera said they were on the bus with no food or water for 23 hours, but their conditions were unclear late Wednesday. Police and fire officials were directing all such inquires to the mayor’s office. Bass’ office said they were in the process of documenting the group’s conditions.

In a statement, Abbott said this was the “1st bus of migrants” dropped off by Texas in Los Angeles.

“Texas’ small border towns remain overwhelmed and overrun by the thousands of people illegally crossing into Texas from Mexico because of President Biden‘s refusal to secure the border,” Abbott said in the statement. “Los Angeles is a major city that migrants seek to go to, particularly now that its city leaders approved its self-declared sanctuary city status. Our border communities are on the front lines of President Biden’s border crisis, and Texas will continue providing this much-needed relief until he steps up to do his job and secure the border.”

It was unclear if additional buses might be en route.

Bass said her office was aware of the bus’ arrival and was ready to greet the migrants when they arrived. She said her office had been preparing for such a moment, given similar recent actions across the country at the order of Republican governors.

“It is abhorrent that an American elected official is using human beings as pawns in his cheap political games,” Bass said in a statement.

“Shortly after I took office,” she added, “I directed City Departments to begin planning in the event Los Angeles was on the receiving end of a despicable stunt that Republican Governors have grown so fond of. This did not catch us off guard, nor will it intimidate us. Now, it’s time to execute our plan. Our emergency management, police, fire and other departments were able to find out about the incoming arrival while the bus was on its way and were already mobilized along with nonprofit partners before the bus arrived.”

Lindsay Toczylowski, with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, explained lawyers are still trying to piece together what documents the migrants have and what their path to asylum will look like.

“We are meeting their hopes for safety and protection here at this welcome center, and by providing them with legal information, including a “Know Your Rights” presentation — giving them the information they need to protect themselves,” Toczylowski said.

But much about the migrants, including what information they had in hand that led them on to the bus, was not clear.

“We don’t know the information they were given to get on the bus,” Cabrera said.

Even confirming their identities appeared difficult, given little documentation.

The Los Angeles City Council last week approved a motion directing various city departments to take the steps required for Los Angeles to officially become a sanctuary city for immigrants.

In April 2022, Abbott directed the Texas Division of Emergency Management to charter buses to transport migrants from Texas to Washington, D.C. Since then, Abbott has also sent migrants to Denver, New York City, Chicago and Philadelphia. The governor’s office has said that about 20,000 migrants have been transported to cities who have passed measures embracing sanctuary status for immigrants. Abbott’s office has said that such moves have offered “much-needed relief to Texas’ overwhelmed border communities.”

Earlier Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office sent public records requests to DeSantis’ office and the Florida Division of Emergency Management seeking information about the recent transport of two groups of immigrants from Florida to northern California.

Bonta said his office is investigating whether any laws were broken by Florida in shipping the three dozen migrants to Sacramento. Gov. Gavin Newsom has suggested DeSantis could potentially face kidnapping charges for transporting the migrants to California, although Florida officials have insisted the migrants went to Florida voluntarily and signed documents agreeing to the travel.

“Contrary to what some may want to think – California is also a border state but instead of demonizing asylum seekers, we focus on working with local communities to support and humanely welcome people,” said Daniel Lopez, the governor’s communications director. “Regarding the recently arrived families, the state is in close communication with the County and City of Los Angeles, and our community partners. Together, we will make sure that the children and families who arrived are safe and welcomed.”

As news spread of the latest transport, other elected officials were chiming in.

“As the author of California’s Sanctuary State in 2017 and son of an immigrant mother, I can tell you that Governor Abbott’s heartless exploitation of asylum seekers is not shocking and reflects a tremendous lack of leadership,” said Councilmember Kevin de Leon. “Callously trafficking vulnerable human beings around for cheap political points reflects a moral bankruptcy that has no place in politics and Los Angeles will not allow this repugnant display of political opportunism to undermine our commitment to ensuring that every person, regardless of origin, is treated with dignity and respect.”

U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) issued a statement late Wednesday.

“Once again, Republicans exploit vulnerable migrants for cynical political gain instead of choosing to work with Democrats to fix our broken immigration system. California will not play Republican’s cowardly games and will treat asylum seekers with the dignity and humanity they deserve.”

Last week’s L.A. City Council action to set in motion sanctuary status for the city was previously OK’d by the council’s Civil Rights, Equity, Immigration, Aging and Disability Committee and the Public Safety Committee. It instructs the city attorney to prepare a draft ordinance within 60 days to prohibit “any city resources, property or personnel from being utilized for any federal immigration enforcement.”

Councilwoman Nithya Raman, who introduced the motion with council members Eunisses Hernandez and Hugo Soto-Martínez, thanked “all the advocates, lawyers and organizations” who work to educate and protect the rights of immigrants.

“For many people in Los Angeles who have been advocating for the city to become an official sanctuary city for many years, this is a long overdue process,” Raman said.

Then-Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an executive directive in 2019 that offered protections to the immigrant community, but it lacked the permanence of a city law, according to Raman.

The council in a 12-0 vote, with council members Bob Blumenfield and John Lee absent, supported the motion Friday to create an official ordinance and codify existing protections set forth in the executive directive.

Last week, DeSantis’ administration said that three dozen migrants whom the state flew from the U.S. southern border to California on private planes all went willingly, disputing allegations by California officials that the individuals were coerced to travel under false pretenses.

The admission of responsibility — five days after the first flight touched down in California’s capital — only served to heighten tensions between DeSantis and Newsom, his frequent political sparring partner.

Two planes arrived in Sacramento, each carrying asylum-seekers mostly from Colombia and Venezuela. The individuals had been picked up in El Paso, Texas, taken to New Mexico and then put on charter flights to California’s capital of Sacramento, said Bonta. He is investigating whether any violations of criminal or civil law occurred.

On Wednesday, Bass added: “Los Angeles is not a city motivated by hate or fear and we absolutely will not be swayed or moved by petty politicians playing with human lives. We are a city that seeks to treat all people with dignity and compassion and we will continue to work closely with non-profit organizations, including the L.A. Welcomes Collective, as well as with our County, State and Federal partners.”

FLORIDA — In response to the Biden administration letting Title 42 expire, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that he is deploying 1,100 personnel, including National Guard troops, to Texas to ""defend the southern border.""



DeSantis said Florida stands ready to aid Texas’ border security crisis by sending 101 Florida Highway Patrol troopers, 200 Florida Department of Law Enforcement officers, 20 Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission officers, 800 National Guard soldiers and 20 radio technicians, mechanics and planners from the Division of Emergency Management to Texas.

Additionally, DeSantis announced he's sending five aircraft with monitoring equipment and downlink capabilities along with two aviation crew teams, two mobile command vehicles, 17 drones and 10 airboats, shallow-draft boats and mid-range vessels.

DeSantis said personnel will deploy to Texas within the next 24 hours. Related: Latino Advocacy Group Issues Travel Advisory For Florida

“The impacts of Biden’s border crisis are felt by communities across the nation, and the federal government’s abdication of duty undermines the sovereignty of our country and the rule of law,” said DeSantis. “At my direction, state agencies, including law enforcement and the Florida National Guard, are being deployed to Texas, with assets including personnel, boats and planes. While Biden ignores the crisis he created, Florida stands ready to help Texas respond to this crisis.”

Title 42 is a pandemic-era policy that shut down virtually all avenues for migrants to seek asylum in the U.S. In March 2020 then-president Donald Trump invoked the rule as a public health emergency measure, and called for the immediate expulsion of migrants at the border.

The Biden administration ended the COVID public health emergency nationally, which let Title 42 expire May 11. Tens of thousands of migrants fleeing poverty, violence and political instability now fall under former U.S. immigration laws that allow them to stay in the country while their cases make their way through immigration court. However, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said the end of Title 42 is already causing ""unprecedented"" chaos at the border. On Tuesday, he announced that he sent letters to each of his fellow governors requesting support through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which allows states to provide resources, including personnel, to other states to assist in times of emergency.

“The flood of illegal border activity invited by the Biden administration flows directly across the southern border into Texas communities, but this crisis does not stop in our state,” said Abbott in his letter. “In the federal government’s absence, we, as governors, must band together to combat President Biden’s ongoing border crisis and ensure the safety and security that all Americans deserve.""

Eight hundred Florida National Guard soldiers are preparing to deploy to the southern border in Texas to stem the tide of immigrants attempting to cross the border. Noting that Texas has spent more than $4.5 billion since 2021 on border security operations with the Texas Legislature currently seeking an additional $4.6 billion for the next two years, he asked fellow governors ""to send all available law enforcement personnel and resources to the Texas-Mexico border to serve alongside our thousands of Texas National Guard soldiers and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers.” In the past 72 hours, the U.S. Border Patrol said three agents have been assaulted while apprehending 14,752 undocumented immigrants. Although 4,316 people attempted to cross the border escaped authorities, the border patrol said those apprehended included five sex offenders and a wanted felon. Border patrol agents confiscated 4 pounds of marijuana, 1 pound of cocaine, two firearms and seized $58,758.

Abbott sent a special note of thanks to Idaho and Florida, the two states that have stepped up to help to date. “We stand with Texas as they work to repel illegal aliens at the border,” said Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie. “We are prepared to assist however needed.”

Through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, DeSantis said states that deploy resources and personnel for emergency situations are eligible for FEMA reimbursement. This isn't the first time Florida has deployed personnel to the southern border. On June 16, 2021, DeSantis sent support and reinforcements following a letter from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas and Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona requesting immediate assistance with the security crisis that was overwhelming law enforcement at the southern border."
