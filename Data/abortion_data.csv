Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin certified a referendum proposal that, if passed, would guarantee a limited right to an abortion, provided supporters can garner enough signatures to get it on the ballot.

In an opinion issued Tuesday, Griffin greenlit pro-choice supporters to get signatures for the Arkansas Abortion Amendment of 2024, having previously rejected the proposal twice for assorted technical reasons, which have since been rectified.

While approving the referendum, Griffin, a Republican, gave ""a cautionary note"" to the petitioners, noting that ""experience has shown a correlation between the length and complexity of initiated measures and their susceptibility to a successful ballot-title challenge.""

""Any ambiguity in the text of a measure could lead to a successful court challenge. Significant changes in law often have unintended consequences that, if known, would give voters serious ground for reflection,"" stated Griffin.

Arkansans for Limited Government, the group behind the proposed amendment, noted in a statement Wednesday that the next step in its efforts will be to gather enough signatures from state voters, with the official kickoff for the effort being on Sunday.

""AFLG invites Arkansans across the state and political spectrum to come together and restore reproductive rights in Arkansas,"" stated the group. ""Everyone is encouraged to volunteer for signature collection and donate to the campaign.""

""This is a crucial step forward in restoring reproductive freedom for Arkansans. AFLG is especially grateful to the AG's staff, whose professionalism and expertise emblematizes true public service.""

The proposed amendment seeks to legalize abortion for up to 18 weeks after conception or under special circumstances, including rape, incest, a diagnosed fatal fetal anomaly or if the mother is facing a life-threatening emergency.

The Arkansas Family Council President Jerry Cox, whose organization is based in Little Rock, said in a statement that the proposed measure was ""a radical amendment legalizing abortion in a way Arkansas has never seen before.""

""It writes abortion into the Arkansas Constitution. It erases virtually all of Arkansas' pro-life laws, and it allows abortion on demand without restriction through the first eighteen weeks of pregnancy,"" Cox said.

""As many as three thousand unborn children could be aborted in Arkansas each year because of this amendment, and the State of Arkansas would be powerless to prevent it.""

Arkansas law prohibits abortion unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother, and the state constitution does not put any limits on the state government to restrict abortion access.

Griffin twice refused to certify the proposed amendment due to issues regarding the measure's language, arguing that certain phrases were too partisan or poorly defined.

In a letter outlining his second rejection, Griffin had said that the way the proposed amendment had misleadingly defined the term ""physical health.""

The amendment language at the time had defined ""physical health"" as ""a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury … caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, or when continuation of the pregnancy will create a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.""

""It defines 'physical health,' not as the absence of disorder, illness, or injury, but as the presence of those things,"" wrote Griffin. ""That is the opposite of the common meaning of 'health.'""

""I suspect you intended something like this: to permit 'abortion services' when, among other things, they 'are needed to protect the pregnant female from a physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury.'"""

Jan 20 2024,Thousands Attend March For Life Hoping To Make Abortion 'Unthinkable',The Federalist,right,https://thefederalist.com/2024/01/20/thousands-of-pro-lifers-attend-march-for-life-hoping-to-make-abortion-unthinkable,"“With every woman, for every child.”

This was the slogan for the 51st annual March for Life in Washington, D.C. on Friday where thousands of pro-life Americans gathered despite snow and frigid temperatures. The annual march marks the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide for nearly 50 years.

Americans of all ages and faith backgrounds gathered at the rally before the march began with a view of the Capitol building in front and a view of the Washington Monument behind them. Young high school students built a snowman while others of all ages gathered in joy to witness and celebrate the beauty of life.

While thousands gathered to hear a variety of speeches, a video played on repeat, speaking to how the death and darkness of abortion will only end with an approach of hope and love. Those gathered were invited to be the light in the darkness, and a voice for unborn babies who have no voice.

The video also referenced, as did many speakers at the rally, that the overturn of Roe v. Wade was a big step but that much is still to be done, promising to “not stop marching until abortion is unthinkable.”

“We are not done. We will keep marching every January at the national level, as well as in our states, until our nation’s laws reflect the basic truth that all human life is created equal and is worthy of protection,” said March for Life President Jeanne Mancini.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave the opening remarks. He spoke about how the birth certificate of America, the Declaration of Independence, bluntly references the fact that our rights do not come from the government but from our Creator.

Johnson also noted that his existence was the result of an unplanned pregnancy. His parents were teenagers when they found out they were pregnant. Johnson showed gratitude to his parents for choosing life, expressing just how blessed he was for that decision.

Jean Marie Davis, executive director of Branches Pregnancy Resource Center, and single mom and author Aisha Taylor, both spoke at the rally about how pregnancy resource centers saved the lives of their children. When they needed help and had nowhere to go, they reached out to one of these centers and were given a similar message: “How can we help you and support you?”

Both women noted that those conversations helped them to have the courage to keep their baby and not get an abortion. Now they could never consider life without their unplanned children.

There are over 2,700 pregnancy centers around the country. While the Biden administration desires to decrease their funding, these centers save lives every year and support mothers with over $300 million of donations in diapers, clothing, baby formula, and other necessities. Keeping these facilities open and available while championing the good they do was a clear message from the rally.

University of Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh, who just clinched the national college football championship a few weeks ago, also shared some words at the rally. “This is a great day for a march. It is football weather,” Harbaugh said, before noting what a great witness to the sanctity of life is being set by the thousands gathered.

Once the walk to the Capitol building and Supreme Court began, thousands of pro-lifers filled the streets. Along the route, you could visibly see groups wearing color-coordinated scarves and hats. There were groups from Michigan, New Jersey, Texas, Indiana, New York and countless others who had traveled across the country to march.

Along the way, you could hear some groups praying the rosary while others sang songs and some led chants in support of the pro-life cause. Not long into the route, a bright yellow sign caught my eye: “Caution genocide content ahead.”

Soon there was a massive television in sight showing pictures of aborted babies. There was even a recording of a baby crying during an abortion. As a father of two, this was the most jarring part of the event. It was explicit and real. But it was true.

The reason why so many made their way through the bitter cold and snow to walk the streets of the nation’s capital was encapsulated by the chants, songs, and images of the day. Those who marched love life. They love families and they love babies.

Speaking to some participants on this cold day their messages were similar. “We come to give voice to the voiceless. We march out of love for life. Protecting their right to life is why we march.”

May the goal of the March for Life come true: let’s make abortion unthinkable because every life has infinite value.

Jan 25 2024,N.D. judge won’t block part of abortion putting doctors at risk,Minnesota Lawyer,center,https://minnlawyer.com/2024/01/25/n-d-judge-wont-block-part-of-abortion-putting-doctors-at-risk,"Listen to this article Listen to this article

BISMARCK, N.D. — A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.

State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.

The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.

In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”

The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.

The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

Soon afterward, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state’s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed in April.

In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine."

Jan 29 2024,Pennsylvania high court revives case challenging limits on Medicaid coverage for abortions,WHYY,center,https://whyy.org/articles/pennsylvania-supreme-court-abortion-limits-medicaid,"The justices who did agree also noted that, while the government was not constitutionally obligated to provide public funding for any medical care, if the state did so, it would be required to provide patients access to abortions “to maintain neutrality so as not to intrude upon the constitutional right to full reproductive autonomy, which includes the right to terminate a pregnancy.”

The ruling does not mean that abortions will automatically be covered by the state’s Medicaid disbursement program. Rather, the court sent the case back to the lower court which will have to grant the petitioners their request for a hearing and resolve the issue under the new framework set by the higher court.

A group of Pennsylvania abortion providers filed the lawsuit in 2019, arguing the state’s Medicaid abortion coverage ban violated the Equal Rights Amendment and equal protection provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Eventually, they petitioned the state Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in October of 2022, leaving the petitioners waiting for the decision until today.

Local pro-choice activists expressed elation after the decision was announced.

“The Court gave our clients an enormous victory this morning,” Women’s Law Project co-executive director Susan J. Frietsche, one of attorneys who argued the case before the Court on behalf of the providers, told WHYY News. “The handling of this matter by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was deep, scholarly, thoughtful, complex and very connected to the reality of women’s experience.”

Advocates on the other side lamented the decision, such as Maria Gallagher, Legislative Director for the Pennsylvania Pro-Life Federation, who accused the Supreme Court of activism.

“This is a tragic development in Pennsylvania,” Gallagher told WHYY News. “There used to be a time when they just kept their opinions on certain issues out of their court rulings. I fear that with this ruling we’re seeing ideology trumping justice.”

The ruling means the Commonwealth may soon become the 18th state in the Union to provide Medicaid funding for abortions beyond the restrictions imposed by the federal government. The Hyde Amendment, first passed in 1977, bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion, except to save the life of the woman, or if the pregnancy arises from incest or rape. However, states are empowered to use Medicaid funds for the procedure if they so choose.

The laws in the 32 other states, along with Washington, D.C., currently follow or parallel the federal standard. Fourteen of those states, such as Alabama, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Texas, outlawed abortion following the Dobbs v. Jackson U.S. Supreme Court decision overturned Roe V. Wade. Several others have placed severe restrictions, making abortion almost completely inaccessible.

National pro-choice advocates also see the ruling as the latest development in a nation deeply divided by the question.

“These Medicaid bans have harmed the most vulnerable the stakeholders, people of color, poor people, rural people,” Lizz Winstead, founder of Abortion Access Front told WHYY News. “Thank God, that’s a right in the Pennsylvania constitution. And thank God the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said you cannot be discriminated against because you need help from your government. If that help means access to abortion, you deserve that.”

Chief Justice Debra Todd dissented overall, arguing that the court is bound by its unanimous 1985 decision that originally affirmed the 1982 law. Justice Sallie Updyke Mundy added that there wasn’t a right to taxpayer money to pay for abortions. However, enough justices agreed that a review is in order and the ruling lower court must decide whether Medicaid can indeed cover the procedures in Pennsylvania."

Jan 24 2024,Measure to temporarily halt North Dakota abortion ban denied by courts,WZFG The Flag,center,https://am1100theflag.com/news/regional-news/72361-measure-to-temporarily-halt-north-dakota-abortion-ban-denied-by-courts,"(Bismarck, ND) -- An effort to temporarily block a ban on abortions in North Dakota has been denied by the courts.

The decision comes from the case between the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Red River Women's Clinic vs North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley, with the plaintiffs arguing the abortion ban is in violation with the state constitution's protection of life and health.

“Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans,” says Meetra Mehdizadeh, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights.

This only impacts the denied temporary pause, and the case will continue to move forward.

""North Dakotans can’t be granted even temporary relief as the court hears our case?” said Tammi Kromenaker, Director of Red River Women’s Clinic, a plaintiff in the case. “I hate to think that someone is harmed as a result of this denial. Abortion is a medical procedure. It is not a crime. No one should be denied health care they are entitled to.”"
Jan 24 2024,ND judge denies request to lift state ban on lifesaving abortions,Valley News Live,center,https://valleynewslive.com/2024/01/24/nd-judge-denies-request-lift-state-ban-lifesaving-abortions,"FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - The Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) is currently embattled with the North Dakota Supreme Court over the state’s abortion ban. The ban, put in place last April, denies women access to abortions within the state, and makes it a crime for any healthcare professional to perform the procedure.

The Center for Reproductive Rights argues that the laws are unconstitutional, especially when it comes to individuals who might need an abortion in order to save their lives. While that case is being pursued, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a request to the Court to temporarily block the law entirely. That request has been denied, with the judge giving a preliminary ruling that the request for an injunction was not appropriate at the time of the proceedings.

This is part of a legal battle that the Center for Reproductive Rights began almost two years ago when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned “Roe v. Wade” in June of 2022. That decision resulted in so-called “trigger bans” in multiple states which immediately restricted access to abortions in almost all circumstances. In March of 2023, North Dakota’s trigger ban was deemed unconstitutional by the North Dakota Supreme Court for not making exceptions for those experiencing medical emergencies and for whom an abortion would a life-saving procedure.

One month later, this ban was signed into law by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum. The new ban imposes strict restrictions on all abortions, with an exception for pregnancies up to 6 weeks. In those cases, an exception will only be made if the pregnancy occurred as a result of rape, incest or would risk the health of the individual. This is the ban which the Center for Reproductive Rights is currently engaged in a legal battle about. The lawsuit is attempting to clarify these exceptions, as they claim “. . . Doctors are unclear who qualifies for the exceptions, and they are terrified to perform any abortions as they face years in prison for violating the bans.”

The ruling to keep the ban in place is preliminary, and the court is awaiting evidence and testimony in the trial before it makes a final decision.

Dec 12 2023,Texas Supreme Court's decision blocking abortion seems to solidify statewide abortion ban,CBS Austin KEYE,center,https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/texas-supreme-courts-decision-blocking-abortion-seems-to-solidify-statewide-abortion-ban,"With the Texas Supreme Court's decision on Monday to block a woman's access to an abortion due to a medical emergency, the state's Republican-led ban on abortions, with few exceptions, seems solidified, despite another case still before the court.

With the national spotlight on Texas, once again, for its abortion policy, the state's highest court rejected a request from a Dallas-area woman named Kate Cox for a court-approved abortion, after she was diagnosed with an unviable pregnancy that could put her future fertility at risk. Cox ultimately left the state to seek an abortion, according to her lawyers.

“This ruling should enrage every Texan to their core. If Kate can’t get an abortion in Texas, who can? Kate’s case is proof that exceptions don’t work, and it’s dangerous to be pregnant in any state with an abortion ban,” Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights which represented Cox, said in a statement on Tuesday. “No one in Texas is taking responsibility for the human suffering abortion bans are causing: not the courts, not the medical board, and certainly not the Attorney General.""



Cox's expedited case moved rapidly in the Texas judicial system: less than a week after filing a lawsuit, her request had reached and been denied by the highest court in the state, a process which normally takes several weeks or months.

Much of the question in her case revolved around what qualified as a ""medical emergency."" In the law passed by the Texas legislature in 2021, the ban on abortions does carve out an exception for medical emergencies, without greatly clarifying what that meant. A separate lawsuit before the Texas Supreme Court, which was argued just two weeks ago, seeks clarification on that question.

Despite that, in its ruling, the wholly-Republican Supreme Court wrote that, ""A pregnant woman does not need a court order to have a lifesaving abortion in Texas. Our ruling today does not block a life-saving abortion in this very case if a physician determines that one is needed under the appropriate legal standard, using reasonable medical judgment. If Ms. Cox’s circumstances are, or have become, those that satisfy the statutory exception, no court order is needed. Nothing in this opinion prevents a physician from acting if, in that physician’s reasonable medical judgment, she determines that Ms. Cox has a 'life-threatening physical condition' that places her 'at risk of death' or 'poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.'""



Since the Supreme Court decided to stay the previous court's ruling granting the abortion, the issue has garnered national attention, and sparked nationwide polarization, even among Republicans.

“I think once a reasonable rule is adopted in a state it should be it should be applied,"" former William Barr, former U.S. Attorney General for the Trump Administration, told CBS Austin in an interview. ""I'm worried about the pro-life forces trying to force restrictions on people that they don't accept and don't agree with and ultimately it creates a backlash that could end up producing more abortions.""



""The idea that Republicans in the state might tack a little bit and even slightly moderate their position, now that they've implemented what is clearly a very limiting and restrictive law, is not coming to pass at this point,"" James Henson, the director of the Texas Politics Project, said. ""Now, we knew that from what we saw in this past legislative session. The legislature, and to some degree the Governor, have had virtually all of 2023 and a largely perpetual legislative session to revisit this issue if they wanted, and they have not.""

Jan 23 2024,Wyoming Democrats introduce bill affirming right to pre-viable abortion,Oil City News,center,https://oilcity.news/community/2024/01/23/wyoming-democrats-introduce-bill-affirming-right-to-pre-viable-abortion,"CASPER, Wyo. — A coalition of Democratic lawmakers in Wyoming has introduced a bill affirming the right to get an abortion before the fetus is viable or to protect the health of the woman.

House Bill 0076, also called the Reproductive Freedom Act, was introduced Jan. 22, the anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. That decision was overturned in summer 2022, removing federal protections for abortion and leaving the issue to the states.

Wyoming had a near-total ban on abortions in place to take effect in the event of that U.S. Supreme Court decision. Pro-choice advocate groups filed suit against the state over the ban in Teton County District Court, asserting a state constitutional right to access healthcare.

That legislation and two other pro-life bills passed by legislature are currently blocked from taking effect as the matters of law are explored in the Ninth Judicial District.

The Life is a Human Right Act asserts that “abortion as defined in this act is not health care” and that a fetus is subject to the interests and protections of the state from conception. There are exceptions for rape and incest, or where there is mortal risk to the woman or to a vital organ.

The Democrats’ bill introduced Monday would prohibit the state from “denying or interfering with a person’s right to have an abortion prior to viability of the fetus or to protect the person’s life or health.”

“‘Viability’ means there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’s sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures,” the bill states.

Jackson Representative and House Minority Floor Leader Mike Yin celebrated his caucus’s bill.

“Reproductive freedom is currently threatened by an unconstitutional abortion ban that represents vast overreach into the lives and medical decisions of individuals,” Yin said in the release. “The introduction of this Act is a crucial step towards protecting and preserving the reproductive rights of all Wyomingites.”

The bill’s authors referenced the case of Kate Cox, a Texas woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a chromosomal disorder at 20 weeks into the pregnancy. She filed suit against the state and eventually left to obtain an abortion after the attorney general indicated it would enforce prosecution on medical providers who violated the law.

Abortion rights advocates have also pointed to findings of the peer-reviewed Turnaway Study, which posits that denying women access to abortions results in worse financial, health and family outcomes.

Anti-abortion advocates have told Oil City News in the past that they believe human life should have legal protections beginning at conception. The Human Right bill also cites the state’s interest in preventing discrimination and “fetal pain.” Moral positions on both sides were previously explored at a Casper rally in fall 2021.

The Reproductive Freedom Act would be expected to face an uphill battle in the Wyoming state legislature, particularly due the focus of the upcoming budget session."

(AP) — A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.

State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.

The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.

In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”

The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state last year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.

The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

Soon afterward, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state’s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed in April.

In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine."

What they're saying: ""... The revised Arkansas Abortion Amendment carefully addressed each concern the Attorney General expressed in his November opinion,"" the group said in a statement after Griffin rejected the second attempt.

""We are pleased that the AG largely agrees with the proposed changes. Our group will work with the drafter to make the singular correction requested in today's opinion.""

Details: The latest version of the Arkansas Abortion Amendment would not allow the state government to ""prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion services (A) in cases of rape, (B) in cases of incest, (C) in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or (D) when, in a physician's good medical judgment, abortion services are needed to protect a pregnant female's life or to protect a pregnant female from a physical disorder, physical illness or physical injury.""

What's next: If Griffin approves the title and language, ALG will have until July 5 to gather nearly 91,000 signatures from registered voters."
Dec 12 2023,"Texas Judges, Abortion, and 2024",Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/12/12/2208766/-Texas-Judges-Abortion-and-2024,"This decision by the Texas Supreme Court — mandating that a pregnant woman carry a dying fetus to term — encapsulates everything that is wrong with the anti choice movement. There is no compassion to be found anywhere in connection with this ruling. I don’t see how people who tout themselves as compassionate Christians would want their friends or family to experience what that poor woman has been forced to endure,

It appears that cracks have begun to emerge in the former monolithic Republican stance on abortion. Republicans should be overrun with joy since the Dobbs decision. After fifty years of incessant political pressure and dissemination of right wing propaganda, they achieved exactly what they have been fighting for. But the Republicans are not happy. They don’t want to talk about it — “it” being the new Republican scarlet letter “A”. Abortion. But talk about it they must.

For the past five decades, the conservative anti-choice right has incessantly trumpeted their belief that human life begins at conception, and to terminate a pregnancy by medical intervention is an act of murder. Not tantamount to, equivalent to, similar to murder — but murder, plain and simple. But now, after the Dobbs decision, it is suddenly morally permissible to commit murder, just so long as it the murder is committed within a fifteen week grace period?

The Republican hypocrisy on the abortion issue is truly astounding when looking at it from this perspective. But in overturning Roe, they finally got what they fought for. And they don’t know what to do. With respect to the issue of abortion, Republicans no longer want the moral high ground for the simple fact that the moral high ground no longer translates into votes. The irony would be laughable if the consequences weren’t so dire.

Truth be told, five years ago I couldn’t have imagined a world in which Republicans kept their mouths shut about abortion. But I’ve come to the conclusion that Republicans don’t really care that much about unborn children. They loved speaking down from their lofty moral high ground on us secular humanists. They judged us as godless, morally bankrupt heathens who sanctioned the extermination of “unborn children”.

But now, at least according to some Republicans like Governor Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, abortion is okay — just so long as the procedure is carried out within the fifteen-week-post-conception time frame. Apparently, the whole “life begins at conception” thing is no longer a Republican talking point.

For the record, I am firmly, 100% pro-choice. Unlike the narrow view of many right wingers, I believe that in many circumstances, abortion is oftentimes the morally preferred course of action. As a male human being, I have little doubt that, if men were the people who carried a pregnancy to term and gave birth, abortion would be legal without restrictions and without a second thought. I don’t think abortion would not be a politically viable issue.

But abortion will be an issue in 2024, because Democrats will make it so. On every abortion rights ballot initiative since the June, 2024 Dobbs decision, the Democractic pro-choice position has emerged victorious in every instance --even in the deep red state of Kansas.

In my experience, people don’t talk about the the personal decision to have an abortion that much — even among very close friends and family members. But abortion procedures are carried out, and many of the women that decide to have abortions are Republicans. Based on the results of ballot initiatives since June, 2024, many conservative women (and perhaps the people they associate with) are not too keen on identifying themselves as ethically compromised.

Two issues must dominate this upcoming presidential election cycle — the preservation of democracy and abortion. The democracy issue will no doubt be front page news all day, every day starting with Trump’s first trial in March. The media coverage of Trump’s January 6, 2021 assault on our democracy will be impossible to ignore.

But I fear that, amid the sensational drama of the Trump’s trials, the abortion issue will be forgotten. That would be a huge mistake in my view. It is essential that democratic candidates force their Republican foes to address the issue. Their political livelihood, as well as our country’s future, depends on it."
Jan 08 2024,The Supreme Court Allows Idaho to Block Emergency Abortions,Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/the-supreme-court-allows-idaho-to-block-emergency-abort-1851148572,"The Supreme Court Allows Idaho to Block Emergency Abortions Idaho can now criminalize doctors who provide emergency, stabilizing abortion care, at least until the Supreme Court hears the case in full this spring.

Late on Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that Idaho can enforce its total abortion ban even when it’s necessary to save a pregnant person’s life, lifting a lower court’s injunction from 2022 that blocked this part of the law. Now, the state can criminalize doctors for offering abortion care during medical emergencies, at least until the Supreme Court hears the case against Idaho’s abortion law in full in April.

The lower court ruling from August 2022 came after the Biden administration filed a lawsuit against Idaho’s abortion law for violating the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). EMTALA, passed in 1986, requires doctors to provide stabilizing, emergency care to patients, including those experiencing pregnancy-related complications. Currently, Idaho’s ironically named “Defense of Life Act” makes it a crime to “perform or attempt to perform an abortion” even when someone’s life would be severely endangered by continuing their pregnancy. The law ostensibly allows an exception only when the state deems that an abortion is “necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman”—which the Biden administration has argued is much narrower than EMTALA.

The Supreme Court’s ruling on Friday is the latest development through months of legal back-and-forth in the state. In October, a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals briefly overturned the lower court’s injunction from 2022. But almost immediately after this, the full Ninth Circuit reversed the panel’s ruling and upheld the injunction.

The decision came just days after another blow to the Biden administration’s attempts to invoke EMTALA to try and protect pregnant people from the rigidity of state abortion bans. In Texas, on Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals similarly ruled that emergency rooms in the state aren’t required to perform life-saving abortions under EMTALA. The Fifth Circuit decision was in response to Biden’s July 2022 guidance to hospitals that, under EMTALA, they’re required to provide emergency abortion care—even if doing so is at odds with state laws.

Rabia Muqaddam, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in Texas “shows a complete disregard for the lives of pregnant people.” She continued, “It suggests that everyone who goes to an emergency room in Texas is entitled to stabilizing care under EMTALA—unless they happen to be a pregnant person who needs an emergency abortion to be stabilized.”

In a statement responding to the Supreme Court’s decision on Friday night, President Biden maintained that his administration “will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law.”

Idaho has one of the most aggressively anti-abortion legal landscapes in the country. Last spring, Idaho Republicans passed a law making it a crime to help a minor travel across state lines for an abortion without their parents’ consent, though the law was blocked by a federal judge in November. Over the summer, Northwest Public Broadcasting obtained a letter from a group of Idaho Republicans sent to hospitals in the state, questioning the accuracy of abortion data that they’ve reported to the government as required by state law and threatening doctors with criminal charges for failing to report abortions.

In June, Idaho ended its maternal mortality review committee, even as the U.S. maintains the highest maternal mortality rate among wealthy nations, and states with more abortion restrictions have disproportionately high maternal mortality rates. At least one hospital in a rural area with limited access to health care shuttered its entire labor and delivery department in March, following a mass exodus of OB/GYNs who feared that continuing to do their jobs in Idaho could land them in prison. Now that the state can render criminal charges against doctors for providing emergency, stabilizing abortion care, these bleak figures are likely to get worse."
Dec 22 2023,Let people decide abortion laws,WIZM,center,https://wizmnews.com/2023/12/22/let-people-decide-abortion-laws,"Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Robin Vos may be on to something. He actually wants to let the people be able to make a decision on an issue important to them. Vos is suggesting Wisconsin hold a referendum on the issue of abortion. You and I and every other eligible citizen would get to cast a ballot, and once and for all decide how the medical procedure should be regulated. Many expect the issue to ultimately be settled by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, but why not let average Wisconsinites have a say? Current state law outlaws abortions after 20 weeks. Under Vos’ plan that would be changed to somewhere between 12 and 15 weeks. So he wants to let voters decide, but the only option is that abortions should be illegal after somewhere between 12 and 15 weeks? Not 16 weeks? Not 17? Not return things to the way they were before? Perhaps that question should be more open ended. Marquette University Law School polls consistently show a majority of Wisconsin residents support legalized abortion. How about asking if abortion should be legal just like it was before the decision to overturn Roe v Wade? That would be letting the people decide."
Jan 07 2024,Florida Abortion Ballot Initiative Reaches Signature Requirement,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/07/florida-abortion-ballot-initiative-reaches-signature-requirement,"Left-wing activists working to put abortion on the ballot this year in Florida have surpassed the number of signatures required by the state to move forward, data from the Florida Division of Elections shows.

As of Sunday, the main sponsor of the initiative, called Floridians Protecting Freedom, collected 911,169 signatures — more than the 891,523 needed to qualify the initiative for the ballot. The total is not official until the secretary of state determines the requisite signatures have been obtained and issues a certificate of ballot position, according to the elections office.

Floridians Protecting Freedom is a coalition of left-wing groups including Planned Parenthood and ACLU of Florida. The language of the initiative states: “Except as provided in Article X, Section 22, no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.” The cited provision allows the state legislature to require parental notification before a minor has an abortion, with the option of a child asking a judge to grant permission.

The measure, if it makes it to the 2024 ballot, would require 60 percent of voters to approve in order to take effect.

In Florida, abortion is legal up to 15 weeks of pregnancy, although the state Supreme Court is expected to determine the future of that law. If it stands, a six-week abortion limit signed in April of 2023 would go into effect.

Whether the abortion measure makes it on the ballot will also be determined by the state’s Supreme Court, which has until April to decide whether to approve the language after a challenge from Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody. The Florida Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case on Feb. 7.

Florida is one of roughly a dozen states where abortion could be on the ballot this year.

The Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, which had invented a federal “right” to abortion in the Constitution, and returned power to individual states and their elected representatives, changing the nature of the struggle between the pro-life movement and the abortion industry. Pro-abortion organizations and activists, backed by the affiliates of large left-wing organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, have stealthily turned to ballot measures in the hopes of shoring up and even growing the abortion complex in the shift from federal to state power.

And so far, their plan is working — every single abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. During the 2022 special elections, Kansans rejected a ballot measure that would have established that the state Constitution does not include a right to abortion. During the 2022 midterms, voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont codified abortion into their Constitutions. At the same time, voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have given rights to babies born alive in botched abortions. Voters in Kentucky also rejected an amendment similar to the one in Kansas. On November 7, Ohioans also voted to codify the supposed “right” to abortion in their state Constitutions via Issue 1.

Anna Hochkammer, executive director of the Florida Women’s Freedom Coalition and a campaign organizer for the ballot initiative, credited their success in getting signatures in part to Ohio’s Issue 1 in an interview with Politico.

“What Ohio did was, it took a lot of people who were doubtful and … didn’t really want to believe what the numbers were telling them and gave them permission to believe that this was possible,” Hochkammer said."

Mr. Biden took the stage last, surrounded by supporters with signs monikered ""Defend choice"" and ""Restore Roe,"" but less than a minute into his remarks, he was interrupted by the protesters.

""How many babies have you killed?"" shouted the first protester before being escorted out by Secret Service agents.

As Mr. Biden continued his speech, he was faced with more than a dozen interruptions. ""Genocide Joe has to go,"" one chanted. ""Ceasefire now!"" another yelled.

Each time protesters were drowned out by Mr. Biden's supporters chanting, ""Four more years!""

Mr. Biden hardly acknowledged the protests, but at one point he said, ""they feel deeply.""

He later added, ""This is going to go on for a while, they've got this planned.""

The exchange underscores the intense political landscape Biden is facing as he vies for a second term.

A CBS News poll conducted in early December revealed that 61% of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

""Across our nation, women are suffering and let us be very clear about who is responsible. Former President Trump hand picked three Supreme Court justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said on Tuesday at a campaign rally in Manassas, Virginia.

The message is a part of a larger strategy of the Biden-Harris campaign's reelection bid as they attempt to connect restrictive abortion laws to Trump and contrast themselves as candidates with an agenda of restoring abortion protections provided under Roe v. Wade. Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden each spoke briefly, espousing their support for reproductive rights.

Currently, abortions are only allowed in Arkansas to save the life of the mother. The proposed amendment would add fatal fetal abnormalities, rape and incest.

In November of 2022, voters rejected an amendment that would have raised the percentage for Constitutional Amendments for passage to 60%. This echoes the situation in Ohio, where the initial attempt to increase the margin failed, allowing the Abortion Rights amendment to pass in the next election cycle.

Arkansas is far from a progressive state, but this can only be good news.

~90K signatures are required by July 5.

Jan 23 2024,Biden rallies for abortion rights in Virginia on same day as New Hampshire primary,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/2813613/biden-abortion-rights-virginia-new-hampshire-primary,"MANASSAS, Virginia — President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris rallied in support of abortion rights in Virginia on Tuesday as New Hampshire voters took part in the unofficial first Democratic primary of the 2024 cycle.

Biden is not on the ballot in New Hampshire after the state declined to abide by a Democratic National Committee decision from last year that elevated South Carolina to first in the nation status. New Hampshire’s primary results will not award any delegates at the national nominating convention this summer, though the president’s supporters have launched an extensive write-in campaign in the hope of helping him secure victory despite not spending a single day campaigning in the Granite State.

Instead, Biden, Harris, first lady Jill Biden, and second gentleman Doug Emhoff held the campaign’s first joint rally of the year at George Mason University, where the president and vice president stressed the need to ensure abortion rights federally and warned of the threats former President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, poses to women’s reproductive freedom and other civil liberties.

Emhoff, who enjoys some of the highest favorability numbers in the entire Biden administration, and the first lady commenced Tuesday’s rally.

“I have an 83-year-old mother, and we also have a 24-year-old daughter, so how is it possible that my mother will have enjoyed more rights than our daughter,” Emhoff declared.

“Reproductive freedom is not a woman’s issue. It’s an everyone’s issue,” he continued. “What they’re doing is immoral. What they’re doing is wrong. We need to stand up for the dignity and freedom of all Americans.”

“We need men in this fight too, so Doug, thank you,” Jill Biden added. “This will not be the legacy we leave to our daughters and granddaughters, will it? The choice this election is clear. Women put Joe and Kamala in the White House, and we will do it again.”

Harris, who has effectively become the face of the Biden administration’s abortion rights push, took the stage immediately after the first and second spouses.

“We have in Joe Biden a courageous fighter for our most fundamental freedoms as Americans, including the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body,” the vice president opened. “Across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and clinics and women. Laws that make no exception, even for rape and incest, and let us all agree, one does not have to abandon their faith, their deeply held beliefs to believe the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.”

“Former President Trump handpicked — handpicked — three Supreme Court Justices because he intended them to overturn Roe. Intended them to take your freedoms. He is the architect of this healthcare crisis,” she continued. “And he is not done. Extremists are not done. In the United States Congress, extremists are trying to pass a national abortion ban in every state. What they need to know is that we will not allow it.”

Finally, Joe Biden took the stage and introduced himself as “Jill Biden’s husband,” a mainstay of his 2020 campaign, yet was repeatedly interrupted by pro-Palestinian protesters.

Joe Biden has been heckled by activists calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for weeks, but Tuesday’s outbursts appeared to be a much more coordinated effort. Fourteen different protesters, located in different parts of the auditorium, interrupted the president thirteen separate times from start to finish.

Still, the president, buoyed by chants of “four more years” and “let’s go Joe” from supporters, powered through and sought to attack Trump for the overturning of Roe.

None of the speakers on Tuesday made any mention of the New Hampshire primary.

Joe Biden’s decision to alter Democrats’ long-adhered-to election calendar stemmed from his want to reward black voters in South Carolina for effectively saving his 2020 campaign, as well as pick a state that better reflected the demographics of America.

Still, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and author Marianne Williamson are looking to throw a speed bump at Joe Biden’s likely nomination by outperforming expectations in New Hampshire, pressing voters on why they should support a man more interested in a “coronation” than an election.

Phillips has said that Joe Biden earning anything less than 80% would be a major failure for the president and could undercut his support ahead of South Carolina’s Feb. 3 primary. For comparison, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, the last two Democrats to seek a second term in the White House, pulled 81% and 84%, respectively, in their reelection New Hampshire primaries.

“If his numbers are below that,” Phillips told reporters over the weekend, “I think it’s just more evidence of the fact that Democrats are deluded and we need a real competition, not a coronation.”

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who is limited by the Hatch Act from discussing the upcoming election, did not bite when asked Tuesday about Joe Biden’s decision to rally in Virginia rather than New Hampshire and referred questions about any scheduling back to the campaign.

“They’re going to be speaking about reproductive healthcare and the importance of that. Yesterday would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade before the Supreme Court overturned Roe, and we have seen the devastating effects that that overturning of Roe have had across the country,” she said before stating that she had not spoken to Joe Biden about his write-in campaign.

“I think the president’s concern right now is making sure that we continue to deliver for the American people,” Jean-Pierre continued. “That’s his focus.”

(Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune via AP, File)

A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.

State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.

The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.

In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”

The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.

The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

Soon afterward, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state’s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed in April.

In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine.

Attorney General Austin Knudsen of Montana stopped an abortion ballot proposal from going through on Tuesday, claiming it was “legally insufficient,” according to the Montana Free Press.

Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana launched the ballot initiative in November 2023, which would prevent “the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability,” according to the Idaho Capital Sun. Knudsen dismissed the proposal, arguing in a memorandum that it was “legally insufficient” and “logrolls multiple distinct political choices into a single initiative,” the Montana Free Press reported.

“Ballot Measure 14 creates an express right to abortion but denies voters the ability to express their views on the nuance of the right,” Knudsen wrote.

Knudsen also claimed that the proposal as written would prevent state lawmakers from imposing any restrictions on abortion if it’s deemed “medically necessary,” according to the Montana Free Press.

“This clause makes it so even regulations that serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest cannot survive,” Knudsen wrote, the Montana Free Press reported.

In addition to prohibiting the government from making laws limiting abortion before “viability,” the ballot initiative would also prevent state officials from enacting any law that would ban abortions in cases deemed necessary to protect the life and health of the mother, according to the Montana Free Press. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a 15-week abortion ban into law in May 2023 that prohibited dilation and evacuation abortions, which typically take place after that point in the pregnancy.

Advocates of the proposal said that they were prepared to take “legal action” if necessary.

“In an attempt to keep an abortion rights initiative out of the hands of voters, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has used the power of his office to put personal politics before a fair process to allow Montanans the opportunity to secure their reproductive rights,” Attorney Raph Graybill told the Montana Free Press Wednesday evening. “Make no mistake: We will do everything we can, including taking legal action, to ensure Montanans have the opportunity to vote to secure their rights to make decisions about their own pregnancies, including the right to abortion care, in 2024.”

Knudsen’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: For America's ruling elites, nothing is more precious, wonderful and life-giving to their great cause than the Jan. 6, 2021 ""insurrection"" at the U.S. Capitol. It's irrelevant that the events didn't come remotely close to constituting an actual ""insurrection,"" or that both police and over 200 undercover FBI assets provoked the riot – which Tucker Carlson calls a ""set-up."" Yet Vice President Kamala Harris still insists the minor riot was just as horrific as the 9/11 terror attacks and Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

WHY are the elites doing this?

It's not just because convicting, imprisoning, torturing and destroying the lives of hundreds of Trump supporters is meant to terrify and intimidate millions of Americans into submission. And it's not just because activist judges and bureaucrats in over 30 states are absurdly trying to keep Trump off their state's election ballots by citing the 14th Amendment's prohibition against anyone who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding elective office.

It's because the elites' destruction of America is so rapid, horrendous and obvious that they feel compelled to turn their opponents into monsters – or lose power at the next election. But that doesn't mean just calling conservatives and Christians ""racists,"" ""white supremacists,"" ""radical extremists"" and ""domestic terrorists"" as they do continually. They know much more is needed.

Question: What if, far from being horrified by a half-baked riot they absurdly claim is worse than any domestic disturbance since the Civil War, the left actually LOVES the idea of violence on the right – the worse the better – since it perfectly serves their agenda? Increasingly, all the evidence strongly suggests today's power-mad leftist elites not only intend to intimidate and discredit their political opponents by calling them terrorists, they mean to provoke actual violence.

The secret strategies and shocking tactics of today's ascendant far-left elites are exposed as perhaps never before in the January issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, headlined ""INCITING VIOLENCE: DEMS' SECRET STRATEGY FOR STAYING IN POWER.""

Jan 23 2024,North Dakota judge won’t temporarily block part of abortion law for doctors,KFYR,center,https://kfyrtv.com/2024/01/23/north-dakota-judge-wont-temporarily-block-part-abortion-law-doctors,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.

State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.

The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.

In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”

The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for the treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.

The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Jan 12 2024,Kansas Republicans introduce House bill prohibiting abortion procedures,WIBW 13,center,https://wibw.com/2024/01/12/kansas-republicans-introduce-house-bill-prohibiting-abortion-procedures,"TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - A piece of legislation has been introduced to the Kansas legislature from Kansas Republicans placing a ban on abortions.

HB 2492 was introduced into the Kansas House on Wednesday, Jan. 10, and referred to the Committee of Health and Human Services. The Kansas Legislature site explains if the bill is enacted, it will “[prohibit] abortion procedures except when necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman and providing a private cause of action for civil enforcement of such prohibition.”

In 2022, Kansas voters rejected a proposed state constitutional amendment that would have denied the right to abortion in the state.

Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee Communications Director Abhi Rahman provided a statement about this latest development:

“Kansas voters made it crystal clear in 2022 that they want abortion rights protections to stay, and Kansas Republican legislators are flying directly in the face of the will of Kansans. This dangerous proposal is insulting to the Kansas voters who showed up in 2022 to affirm their support for the protection of fundamental freedoms and once again shows the importance of winning state legislatures, where most legislation that affects your day-to-day life gets done.

“The DLCC is focused on building Democratic power in Kansas to protect fundamental freedoms in the state. Breaking the Republican supermajorities is crucial to protecting Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s veto power and the reason why Kansas remains on our 2024 target map. To protect fundamental freedoms, Kansas needs to elect Democratic legislators. The DLCC will be partners with allies on the ground every step of the way to make that a reality.”

The National Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) officials listed what other states are doing related to abortion legislation:

New Hampshire proposed a 15-day abortion ban

Florida introduced a ban that would make performing an abortion a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison

Missouri proposed allowing homicide charges for people who have abortions

The U.S. Supreme Court allowed an abortion ban to go into effect in Idaho

Representative Michael Murphy of District 114 is one of eight representatives sponsoring the bill. In a statement, Rep. Murphy said to 13 NEWS:

“The bill was filed on behalf of Students for Life. I explained to them the unlikelihood it would receive a hearing but they are passionate and I did not want to dampen their enthusiasm. SB286 was introduced in 2023 and is identical to this bill and it has not been heard either. This is no different from bills that would restrict gun owners that are introduced every year, such as HB2413 was earlier this session. Most bills that are introduced never receive a hearing, but the filing does start a conversation. I don’t believe people should be silenced just because what they believe might be unpopular with some people. More speech, as long as it’s civil, is always better.”

Jan 18 2024,Abortion rights group begins signature collection campaign with tight deadline,Springfield News-Leader,center,https://news-leader.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/18/missouri-abortion-rights-group-launches-signature-collection-campaign/72261770007,"Abortion rights coalition Missourians for Constitutional Freedom has launched its signature collection campaign to allow voters to decide whether to legalize abortion.

Following a lengthy legal battle that culminated in November, the group spent time deliberating which of its initiative petitions it would pursue in this campaign.

It decided upon a petition that guarantees the right to reproductive care, which encompasses abortion, birth control, prenatal, childbirth, postpartum and miscarriage care, as well as respectful birthing conditions.

In addition, it allows for government regulation of abortion after fetal viability, which refers to the point at which a fetus could survive outside the womb without extraordinary medical intervention. It would also allow regulation if those rules would improve the health of the patient without infringing on their autonomy.

The group is made up of the ACLU of Missouri, Abortion Action Missouri, Planned Parenthood Great Plains Votes and Advocates of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri.

Missouri was the first state to enact a trigger law banning abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, making almost all abortions illegal in the state.

Dr. Iman Alsaden, advisor to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said the decision by the state’s elected officials is out of touch with the needs and desires of Missourians.

""Politicians in Jefferson City are endangering the lives and wellbeing of the patients I care for, plain and simple,” Alsaden said in a release. “Missouri's cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care. Today, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.""

Advocates of the proposed constitutional amendment say decisions surrounding pregnancy, including abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care, are best handled by patients and their families, rather than taken into the hands of legislators.

""I have always trusted all patients to make decisions that are best for their unique situations and lives,” Alsaden said. “As a Missourian, I’m proud to join with other providers, advocates, and patients to end the harm caused by Missouri’s abortion ban.""

The group must collect over 171,000 signatures before early May in order for the initiative petition to be eligible for placement on either the August or November ballot. While it should usually take no more than 54 days to certify a ballot measure, legal battles over the ballot language and fiscal note dragged on for more than eight months.

Ballotpedia estimates it costs about $9.38 per signature collected nationally in 2023. That means it could cost more than $1.6 million to gather the necessary signatures to get the proposal on the 2024 Missouri ballot.

More:Many groups support abortion in Missouri, but no single petition has unanimous backing

Another group is seeking to restore limited access to abortions in Missouri, but it is facing its own legal challenges. However, that isn’t stopping their efforts to collect signatures.

Jamie Corley, in conjunction with the Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, launched a signature collection in November on one of the six ballot initiatives filed.

The petition that Corley's group is circulating would allow abortions to be performed until 12 weeks of gestation, or before fetal viability in the case of rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormality or risks to the health of the mother, although victims of rape of sexual assault must have reported the incident to a crisis hotline.

Corley’s petition has been positioned as a middle-ground to the petition from Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, but it has received criticism from both anti-abortion and pro-abortion advocates."
Jan 18 2024,Coalition launches campaign to reverse Missouri’s near-total abortion ban,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,center,https://stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/coalition-launches-campaign-to-reverse-missouri-s-near-total-abortion-ban/article_0bd5d3e6-b5a0-11ee-92d3-ffaf5e8464f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A coalition of abortion rights supporters launched a campaign Thursday to reverse Missouri’s near-total abortion ban, an effort that could place the issue front-and-center for voters this election year.

A group including the ACLU of Missouri, Abortion Action Missouri and both of the state’s Planned Parenthood chapters announced they had gotten behind an initiative petition that would create a right to an abortion in the Missouri Constitution.

The effort promises to generate national attention as a state-by-state fight plays out in the aftermath of the reversal of Roe v. Wade by the U.S. Supreme Court.

After its announcement Thursday, the campaign, Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, reported 20 large contributions totaling more than $1.1 million to the Missouri Ethics Commission. The donations flowed to the campaign in the two days leading up to the announcement.

The largest — $500,000 — came from the Fairness Project, a dark-money nonprofit group that has contributed to progressive Missouri ballot initiatives in the past.

Individuals and groups listing Missouri addresses gave a combined $512,025 to the effort. Sixteen of the 20 donors listed Missouri addresses.

All but one Missouri donation came from either St. Louis or St. Louis County.

The largest donors listing St. Louis addresses included the ACLU of Missouri ($100,000); Abortion Action Missouri ($100,000); and Laura Cohen of St. Louis ($100,000).

Planned Parenthood Great Plains, listing an Overland Park, Kansas, address, gave $75,000.

The campaign faces a pressing May 5 deadline to submit the roughly 180,000 signatures needed to make the ballot.

“We are so excited to have come together in this fight on this initiative to end Missouri’s abortion ban. And I believe that we can win,” said Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri.

Currently, abortions in Missouri are only allowed in medical emergencies — the result of a state law that took effect in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.

The measure supporters are collecting signatures for would allow the state to restrict or ban abortion after fetal viability, unless the life or health of the mother is at risk.

The proposed reversal is similar to a constitutional amendment Ohio voters approved in November protecting abortion rights in that state.

It had been an open question as to whether a Missouri campaign would get off the ground.

Courtroom fighting between Republicans delayed signature collection last year. State courts finalized wording for six potential ballot measures in November. But activists still had not settled on which version to pursue.

Five of the six measures state courts finalized would allow the state to restrict abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy or fetal viability; one plan would not have any such limit.

Activists ultimately settled on allowing the state to restrict abortions after fetal viability. Under the measure, a treating health care professional would determine whether there is a “significant likelihood of the fetus’s sustained survival” outside the uterus without extraordinary measures.

“Today, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room,” Dr. Iman Alsaden, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. “As a Missourian, I’m proud to join with other providers, advocates, and patients to end the harm caused by Missouri’s abortion ban.”

Not everyone was satisfied with the fetal viability limit. Pamela Merritt, executive director of Medical Students for Choice, referenced the Roe decision, which allowed states to prohibit abortion after viability unless it was needed to protect the life or health of the mother.

“Codifying the most problematic components of Roe is a tactic that completely rejects the reproductive justice framework, placing greater importance on the rights of some while sacrificing abortion access for people most impacted by abortion bans,” Merritt said in a statement.

“There is no test that definitively determines viability,” she said. “Viability should never be used to restrict access to care, and it absolutely should not be enshrined in state constitutions as a requirement to access abortion.”

Groups such as Planned Parenthood and Abortion Action Missouri had refused to get behind a more moderate alternative by the Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, which would allow abortion within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Thursday’s launch followed the recent formation of Missouri Stands with Women, a campaign by abortion opponents to counter the abortion rights initiative.

That group says it will help lead the fight against initiative petitions aimed at “reversing Missouri’s pro-life laws and enshrining extreme abortion initiatives to the state’s constitution.”

Missouri Stands with Women reported two large contributions Thursday: $10,000 from the Senate Republicans campaign fund, and $10,000 from the House Republican Campaign Committee.

Republicans in the Missouri Legislature, meanwhile, have sought to make it more difficult to amend the constitution.

House Speaker Dean Plocher said this month that he wants initiative petition changes on the Aug. 6 primary ballot.

If approved, that could complicate any path to passage for an abortion constitutional amendment in November.

JoDonn Chaney, spokesman for Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, said in 2022 that if voters raise the threshold in August 2024, the new requirement would be in effect for the November 2024 elections.

Chuck Hatfield, a Jefferson City attorney, said at the time an August 2024 vote to increase the threshold “likely would” affect questions on the November 2024 ballot, though he said “the law is not completely clear” and that there would likely be litigation on the question.

“This initiative petition campaign to legalize abortion in the state of Missouri makes initiative petition reform even more important,” Sen. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, said Thursday on the Senate floor."

Jan 05 2024,Supreme Court upholds Idaho abortion ban law,KBOI 2,center,https://idahonews.com/news/local/supreme-court-upholds-idaho-abortion-ban-law,"The Supreme Court has ruled on Idaho's strict abortion ban law, and they have decided to allow it to stick around.

The Justices have put a hold on a lower court ruling that blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies. Arguments will be heard in April on that part of the bill.

The Biden administration argues that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by Federal Law to provide emergency care, no matter what state law says.

The president also said the ban is forcing doctors to leave the state because it interferes with caring for patients.



Idaho's law makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion. A judge in Idaho agreed with the Biden administration's argument. A Texas judge sided with the state.

While the courts continue to hear the finer points and caveats to the ruling, for now at least, Idaho's abortion ban stands as is.

The Idaho Democrat Party Chair Lauren Necochea has issued a statement in light of the Supreme Court's decision.

Idaho’s abortion ban, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature and signed by Governor Brad Little, endangers the lives of pregnant Idahoans and undermines the duty hospitals have to treat and stabilize sick patients. Simply preserving the patient’s health is considered a criminal act. It is unconscionable that the U.S. Supreme Court is now allowing Idaho to block abortion care even in medical emergencies.

Necochea reaffirms the IDP's plan to continue fighting the abortion ban.

Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador praised the decision.

We are very pleased and encouraged by the Supreme Court’s decision today. The federal government has been wrong from day one. Federal law does not preempt Idaho’s Defense of Life Act. In fact, EMTALA and Idaho’s law share the same goal: to save the lives of all women and their unborn children. Today, the Supreme Court’s decision is a big step in stopping the administration’s lawless overreach. The people of Idaho have spoken with clarity on the issue of life."
Jan 17 2024,Abortion-rights coalition launches campaign to put amendment on Missouri ballot,Missouri Independent,left,https://missouriindependent.com/2024/01/17/abortion-rights-coalition-viability-campaign-amendment-missouri-ballot,"After months of court battles and internal squabbles, a coalition of Missouri abortion-rights organizations plan to officially launch an effort Thursday to put a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to legalize abortion up until the point of fetal viability.

Despite reports of discord within the coalition, the campaign has the support of Abortion Action Missouri, the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kansas City and St. Louis.

Missouri has one of the most restrictive laws in the country, banning all abortions except in the case of medical emergencies. A political action committee called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom announced Thursday it would begin to gather signatures to put an initiative petition on the statewide ballot rolling back that ban.

The coalition estimates it will need to raise $5 million to successfully gather enough signatures to meet the May deadline.

The organization has settled on a version of its 11 initiative petitions that would allow the legislature to “regulate the provision of abortion after fetal viability provided that under no circumstance shall the government deny, interfere with, delay or otherwise restrict an abortion that in the good faith judgment of a treating health care professional is needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.”

The proposed constitutional amendment won out over other versions, including one that would have sought to make abortion legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and another that would have removed any gestational limits on abortion completely.

“Missouri’s cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care,” Dr. Iman Alsaden, advisor to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a statement. “Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.”

The coalition has until May 5 to gather more than 171,000 valid signatures from across the state. If they succeed in this expensive endeavor, the amendment will appear on the statewide ballot.

A competing Republican-led ballot initiative, which started collecting signatures in November, is seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution up to 12 weeks. It would also allow exceptions for rape and incest.

Dr. Selina Sandoval, who works as a full-time abortion provider in Kansas, said that practically every day she sees patients traveling from Missouri to Kansas for care. She said after the “devastating” news that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she’s hopeful change may be on the horizon.

“We’re very optimistic. We know that the majority of Americans and the majority of Missourians feel that abortion should be legal and accessible,” said Sandoval, who is also associate medical director at Planned Parenthood Great Plains. “They are risking financial security, they’re having to travel across state lines. And it’s just a very unnecessary, cruel, very unjust ban that we’re facing.”

Viability language

In the nearly 19 months since the June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision put abortion laws in state’s hands, voters in seven states have approved ballot measures to preserve or expand abortion access.

Abortion-rights advocates have said they are confident an attempt to expand access would also pass in Missouri. But they were less sure of just how far to go in a state that has veered from a swing state to staunchly Republican over the last two decades.

Proponents settled on viability language, defined in the initiative petition as the point in pregnancy when “there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’s sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.”

Viability language is also drafted into proposed ballot measures this year in Arizona, Florida, Nebraska and Nevada. Last fall, Ohioans voted to legalize abortion up to the point of viability.

Viability can be difficult to define, though it’s usually determined to be between 20 and 25 weeks gestation. Despite the language being somewhat common in state laws, it’s also controversial. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has dissuaded the use of viability limits in legislation, as there is no single clinical definition of viability.

“Legislative bans on abortion care often overlook unique patient needs, medical evidence, individual facts in a given case, and the inherent uncertainty of outcomes in favor of defining viability solely by gestational ages,” the college wrote in a statement online. “Therefore, ACOG strongly opposes policy makers defining viability or using viability as a basis to limit access to evidence-based care.”

Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said the coalition believes the viability language meets most Missourians where they are.

“Many members of our coalition are out talking about abortion with Missourians every day, and we know that Missourians often have complex or nuanced positions on abortion, but there is one thing that they are aligned in, and it’s that they want to end the abortion ban,” Schwarz said. “That they do not support the abortion ban we are living under today, and we are confident this is our best path forward.”

Race to gather signatures

Abortion-rights groups around the state have blamed Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft for the delay in getting a petition off the ground.

In November, Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, backed by the Missouri ACLU, won a legal battle over the ballot summary language, giving the coalition the green light to move ahead with signature gathering.

“Any campaign that would move forward is left to contend with a myriad of challenges, including a severely constricted timeline,” Schwarz said following a November court ruling. “At the same time there is incredible opportunity and there’s hope here because we continue to see abortion rights and access remain a top priority for voters across the country.”

Now Schwarz said she is confident they can raise the money to get the signatures they need despite the short timeline, though she didn’t provide clarity on how much money has been raised, or how soon signature gathering will begin.

In Ohio, more than $70 million was spent on both sides in the fight over enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution, the Associated Press reported. This included several million in donations toward the pro-abortion movement from national funders.

The question remains for both of Missouri’s coalitions: Is there enough time and financial support to successfully gather the necessary signatures by May?

As of their January quarterly fundraising report filed to the Missouri Ethics Commission on Tuesday, the group had no cash on hand. They raised just shy of $13,500 in 2023, mostly in in-kind donations from the ACLU of Missouri for legal representation.

In mid-November, Jamie Corley, a longtime GOP Congressional staffer, launched a campaign effort for an initiative petition that would add rape and incest exceptions to Missouri’s abortion ban and legalize the procedure up to 12 weeks.

Like Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, Corley’s initiative also seeks to protect doctors and pregnant patients from prosecution. Currently, any health care providers who violate the law can have their medical licenses suspended or revoked and face a class B felony, and five to 15 years in prison.

As of Tuesday, Corley had raised more than $61,000, and had spent little of it, according to the Missouri Ethics Commission. The majority of the donations were given by Corley herself.

Experts have called Missouri’s signature gathering process costly and “tortuous.”

Jack Cardetti, who helped run a number of successful initiative petition campaigns in Missouri, previously told The Independent that high dollar donations can be an indicator of success as the deadline to collect signatures from six of Missouri’s eight congressional districts draws near.

Anti abortion group mobilizes against ballot efforts

Last week, a political action committee called Missouri Stands with Women was launched to “push back against the Big Abortion Industry.”

The committee, whose president is veteran anti-abortion activist Sam Lee, was formed to fight any abortion initiative petitions that make it to the ballot.

“Out-of-state extremists pushing Big Abortion’s agenda are intent on using the initiative petition process to reverse all the pro-life work our state has undertaken to protect the dignity of life, safety of women and parental rights,” Stephanie Bell, a spokeswoman for Missouri Stands with Women and a lawyer based out of Jefferson City, said in a news release Tuesday.

As of Thursday morning, the group had received one donation of just over $5,000, from the Missouri Catholic Conference.

In the December issue of The Messenger, a publication by the Missouri Catholic Conference, a letter from Missouri bishops encouraged Missourians to vote against any abortion initiatives that make it to the ballot.

“Even with legal protections for the unborn, as we have in our state today, more can still be done to build a culture of life,” the bishops wrote.

Missouri has long been a national example of what a state might look like post-Roe.

Since 2018, Missouri was already down to just one abortion clinic. Prior to the trigger law, abortion was banned after eight weeks in Missouri.

Missouri anti-abortion lawmakers for years have been making abortion access more difficult.

Before abortion became illegal, Missouri law required doctors to have admitting privileges at close hospitals before performing abortions. Patients sought abortions first had to receive state-mandated counseling from the doctor which discouraged abortion. If the woman still wanted to proceed, she then had to wait 72 hours to get the procedure, which had to be done by the same doctor who issued the counseling.

As a result, the number of abortions performed in Missouri dropped dramatically. In 2021, only 150 abortions were performed in Missouri, according to state health department data.

But many thousands of Missouri women are still getting abortions. In 2020, more than 3,200 Missourians received abortions in Kansas, according to the state health department. The same year, more than 6,500 Missourians received abortions in Illinois.

Thursday’s news release from the coalition also highlighted Missouri’s alarming rates of maternal mortality and morbidity, in part due to pregnancy complications.

“OBGYNs and maternity practices are packing up and moving away to avoid political harassment and criminalization,” the release read. “We don’t have time to wait. Together, we are going to end Missouri’s cruel abortion ban.”"
Jan 05 2024,Florida Officially Has the Signatures to Put Abortion on the Ballot,New Republic,left,https://newrepublic.com/post/177901/florida-has-signatures-abortion-ballot-2024,"That has Republican leaders running scared. State Attorney General Ashley Moody, a DeSantis ally, has asked the Florida Supreme Court to disqualify the amendment. She argues the language is misleading, claiming that the use of the word “viability” could have multiple meanings. The state’s high court will hear arguments on February 7.

In November, state Republican Representative Rick Roth quietly introduced a measure to raise the threshold for ballot initiatives to 66.7 percent of votes—just above the definite level of support for abortion access in Florida. The measure has not left the committee, and it’s unclear how far it will actually go. Roth introduced a similar measure in 2022 that easily passed the state House, but it failed in the Senate.

But even if Roth’s bill fails again, it’s a sign of just how far Republicans are willing to go to block people from voting on abortion access. Ballot initiatives have led to multiple major abortion rights wins, even in otherwise deep-red states. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, multiple Republican-led states have put the question of abortion on the ballot—and every single time, voters choose to dramatically increase protections."
Jan 22 2024,Vice President Kamala Harris voices support for abortion access at Wisconsin visit,Wisconsin Public Radio,center,https://wpr.org/news/vice-president-kamala-harris-wisconsin-support-abortion-access,"On the 51st anniversary of the monumental Roe v. Wade decision, Vice President Kamala Harris took to Waukesha County to discuss the importance of protecting abortion rights in post-Roe America.

The visit — which was the first stop on her “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour — comes days after Wisconsin Republicans unveiled a bill that would ban abortions after 14 weeks.

During a speech in Big Bend, Harris said she and President Joe Biden will work to defend abortion rights from “extremists” who want to see it banned.

“In a state whose motto is ‘Forward,’ these extremists are trying to take us backwards,” Harris said. “But we’re not having that. We’re not having that.”

Harris said a health care crisis was created when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, removing federal abortion protections. The June 2022 decision pushed abortion regulations back to the states. In Wisconsin, the procedure essentially ceased until late 2023 when a Dane County judge ruled a state law enacted in 1849 bans feticide and not consensual abortions.

“Just look at what the fallout has been, the reproductive care clinics across the state that had to close, the women that hospitals had to turn away,” Harris said.

On Monday, state lawmakers discussed the the GOP bill that would ban abortions unless the mother is at risk of dying or incurring irreversible injuries. The Republican bill, introduced Friday, would shorten Wisconsin’s abortion ban from 20 weeks to 14 weeks after fertilization.

The legislation would not go into effect without the support of voters via an April referendum. It would also require support from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has promised a veto.

Harris also promised to protect abortion access at the national level.

“What they need to know is that if Congress passes a national abortion ban, President Joe Biden will veto it,” Harris said.

The visit comes just one day after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis dropped out of the presidential race, almost ensuring the 2024 election will be a rematch of the 2020 election. This, as Biden’s job approval rating in November was 40 percent, according to a Marquette University Law School Poll. That poll found former president Donald Trump was leading Biden among registered voters in the 2024 race for president.

The Marquette poll also found that 40 percent of registered voters said abortion was one of the most important issues to them.

Biden also stated his support for abortion rights on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.

“On this day and every day, Vice President Harris and I are fighting to protect women’s reproductive freedom against Republican officials’ dangerous, extreme, and out-of-touch agenda,” Biden said in a statement. “We stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman’s right to choose, and continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe in federal law once and for all.”

Harris’ visit is another reminder of the key role Wisconsin will play in the upcoming election. Waukesha County, where she spoke, has been a Republican stronghold for decades. In 2020, Trump received nearly 60 percent of the vote there.

During a call with reporters before her visit, Wisconsin GOP Chair Brian Schimming said Harris was in Wisconsin for political reasons.

“They’re (Biden and Harris) losing this election,” Schimming said.

He also said the trip was a way to distract voters about the administration’s record.

“For the Vice President to jet into Wisconsin now with this trail of problems this administration is facing, from a policy perspective and from a political perspective, is disgraceful,” he added.

Monday’s visit was Harris’ fifth to the state since taking office. In August, she visited Kenosha to praise plans from Nokia to manufacture broadband network electronics in Kenosha County.

Biden also visited Wisconsin three times last year, most recently in December when he appeared at the Wisconsin Black Chamber of Commerce to tout investments his administration has made for small, Black-owned businesses.

Biden will again travel to Wisconsin on Thursday to discuss his economic agenda for the nation, which his administration has labeled “Bidenomics.” He’ll be in Superior touting a more than $1.05 billion investment to replace the Blatnik Bridge.

Jan 10 2024,Republican debate: Haley and DeSantis tangle over abortion stances,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/2791349/republican-debate-haley-and-desantis-tangle-over-abortion-stances,"Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) battled over who had the most anti-abortion rights stance during a CNN primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Wednesday night.

DeSantis slammed Haley over her often-repeated statements that she doesn’t support jailing women who receive abortions.

“When she says things like, ‘Pro-lifers need to stop talking about throwing women in jail,’ that’s a trope. No one I’ve ever met thinks that that’s something that’s appropriate,” DeSantis said of Haley. “I think when she starts bringing that in, that’s using the language of the Left to try to attack pro-lifers.”

Haley hit back at DeSantis when given the chance to respond.

“These fellas don’t know how to talk about abortion,” Haley said. “I have said over and over again: The Democrats put fear in women on abortion, and Republicans have used judgment. This is too personal of an issue to put fear or judgment.”

The overturning of Roe v. Wade in June 2022 proved to give conservatives a long-hoped-for policy win while costing them key electoral races during the 2022 midterm elections and 2023 off-year elections. The losses have prompted some soul-searching in the GOP over how to message on abortion.

As DeSantis courts evangelical voters in Iowa, a group known for its opposition to abortions, he has often touted signing a six-week abortion limit, similar to an abortion restriction Gov. Kim Reynolds (R-IA), a DeSantis supporter, has also signed into law.

Haley stated she was “unapologetically pro-life,” a phrase she has often repeated while running for office. She has also called for compassion from both sides of the abortion access debate, given the sensitive nature of pregnancy.

DeSantis and Haley did agree on at least one matter as they argued over abortion. “At the end of the day, I do agree with her on this: Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you, here in Iowa, to explain this change he’s had in this positioning.”

The Florida governor previously said he didn’t believe Trump was sufficiently anti-abortion rights after the former president criticized his six-week abortion ban."
Jan 10 2024,Supreme Court to hear case regarding Idaho abortion ban,The Biblical Recorder,not-yet-rated,https://brnow.org/news/supreme-court-to-hear-case-regarding-idaho-abortion-ban,"Baptist Press photo by Brandon Porter.



NASHVILLE (BP) – The Supreme Court will rule on a case involving an Idaho law that bans nearly all abortions in the state.

The high court agreed to hear a challenge to the law, known as the Defense of Life Act, which makes it a felony for doctors to perform most abortions, with an exception for procedures performed when necessary to save the life of the mother.

Last Friday (Jan. 5), the Supreme Court ruled Idaho can enforce the law while the case involving the legislation is being resolved. The court is expected to hear the case in April, and a decision is expected by early summer.

The Friday ruling put on hold a lower court ruling which blocked the Idaho law, based upon a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration.

The U.S. Department of Justice has argued that Idaho’s ban on abortion is preempted by a federal law passed in 1986 called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which requires hospitals that receive Medicare funds to provide emergency medical care. The DOJ’s challenge to Idaho’s abortion ban argues that abortion is implied as a necessary component of emergency medical care.

Brent Leatherwood, president of the SBC’s Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (ERLC), said the lawsuit filed by the Biden administration against the state of Idaho is a wrongful “twist” of federal law seeking to “thwart” the state’s legislation.

“Despite what some activists and parts of culture want you to believe, abortion is not health care,” Leatherwood said.

“In fact, it turns the entire notion of health care on its head. Equally alarming are those who, in the furtherance of abortion, seek to twist federal law to mandate that doctors violate their conscience in the medical care they provide. All of this is preposterous, and the Supreme Court should see through this backdoor attempt by the Biden Administration to thwart Idaho’s ‘Defense of Life’ state law.

“Emergency room doctors are more than capable of quickly managing life-threatening situations for mothers like ectopic pregnancies with the utmost care. But they should never be forced to perform elective abortions that terminate the life of a preborn child. The Supreme Court’s decision to review this case is potentially a positive step to both uphold a state’s action to protect life and rebuke the federal government for doing Planned Parenthood’s bidding.”

In a statement released last Friday in response to the high court’s announcement, President Joe Biden said his administration will continue to “defend a woman’s ability” to seek an abortion under federal law.

“Today’s Supreme Court order allows Idaho’s extreme abortion ban to go back into effect and denies women critical emergency abortion care required by federal law,” Biden said in a statement released Jan. 5.

“The overturning of Roe v. Wade has enabled Republican elected officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans like this one that continue to jeopardize women’s health, force them to travel out of state for care, and make it harder for doctors to provide care, including in an emergency. These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America.

“The Vice President and I believe that health care decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law.”

Idaho’s Defense of Life Act was originally enacted in 2020 and took effect after the Supreme Court’s historic overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Under the law, emergency room doctors who illegally perform an abortion are potentially subjected to:

jail time ranging from two to five years

fines

temporary suspension or permanent revocation of a medical license

They are also subject to Idaho’s civil law, which allows immediate and extended family members to sue for up to $20,000 over an abortion procedure.

In August 2022, a U.S. District judge agreed with the U.S. Department of Justice that Idaho’s law violated EMTALA and issued a temporary injunction, partly blocking the law from taking effect.

The Idaho Legislature appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and a trio of judges from that court reversed the previous injunction with an order issued in September 2023, allowing the state’s ban on abortion to stay in effect.

Yet that decision only remained effective for approximately two weeks. The injunction was subsequently reinstated when the full panel of appellate judges opted to reexamine the case en banc, meaning a new, randomly selected group of judges would reconsider the case and deliver a fresh verdict. This rehearing was planned for Jan. 23, but it has since been rendered unnecessary as the Supreme Court has decided to review the case.

In a similar case, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently determined that ER physicians in Texas were not required to perform emergency abortion care under EMTALA, in a decision announced just days before the high court agreed to rule on Idaho’s law barring abortion.

Leatherwood noted the importance of continuing to fight for the pro-life cause amid these ongoing legal battles.

“It is imperative for all of us who care about the lives of preborn children, their mothers and families to make it clear that abortion is wrong, and the ability to end a defenseless life is no freedom at all,” Leatherwood said.

Feb 02 2024,"Wyoming Supreme Court: Anti-abortion lawmakers, group can’t intervene in lawsuit over bans - WyoFile",WyoFile,right,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-supreme-court-anti-abortion-lawmakers-group-cant-intervene-in-lawsuit-over-bans,"Anti-abortion lawmakers and Right to Life Wyoming won’t be joining the legal fight to preserve abortion bans in the state — at least not directly.

The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled Friday that this group, which had fought since fall 2022 to join the suit against the two bans, will not be allowed to intervene. The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office is already defending the bans.

“The district court reasonably concluded the State Defendants adequately represented the Proposed Intervenors’ interest and permissive intervention would cause undue delay and prejudice,” the justices wrote in their decision. “It therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying permissive intervention.”

Justices added that they didn’t question the dedication or efforts of the lawmakers or Right to Life Wyoming, but disagreed that their interests are unique from the public generally.

“The persuasive weight of authority holds that advocating for a policy and lobbying for legislation to enact that policy does not give an individual or entity a protectable interest in a legal challenge to the subsequently enacted law,” they stated.

The justices added that their concern with allowing intervention “based on a policy interest shared by the general public is the potential for interjection of political debate into a purely legal proceeding. Courts are not forums for such debates.”

Reps. Chip Neiman (R-Hulett), Rachel Rodriguez-Williams (R-Cody) and the anti-abortion organization fought to join the suit because they said their work outside — and inside — the Wyoming Legislature could be threatened if the bans were blocked. The lawmakers were also sponsors or co-sponsors in both abortion bans, which are on hold as the legal challenge to them proceeds through the courts.

The three also argued the state wasn’t presenting enough factual evidence in the case to support the bans.

However, the justices disagreed on all points, finding the trio didn’t have the standing to intervene, nor could they intervene because they simply disagreed with the state’s approach.

“The Proposed Intervenors do not have a protectable interest in this litigation, and thus the district court did not err in denying them intervention as of right,” the opinion states.

As to whether lawmakers’ work at the Legislature could be affected by this lawsuit, the justices were unequivocal: “Regardless of the outcome of this case, the legislature may still legislate in these areas. To the extent it must do so within constitutional parameters established by a court decision in the case, that is not a diminution of its power, but is instead a product of the separation of powers that underpins our government.”

In response to the court’s opinion, Rodriguez-Williams stated in an email that, “While we are disappointed in the court’s decision, we are proud to continue our pro-life work in the legislature and in our everyday lives. I pray that the courts will uphold Wyoming’s pro-life law, which will save lives and protect women’s health.”

The trio’s legal counsel — conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom — added that Wyoming will “continue its life-saving efforts.”

“We’re proud to serve alongside Right to Life of Wyoming and Reps. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and Chip Neiman, who remain dedicated to seizing every opportunity to protect vulnerable members of our society,” ADF Senior Counsel Tim Garrison stated.

Had they been allowed to intervene, the case before the 9th District Court in Teton County could’ve been set back months as various motions and arguments were relitigated, according to the plaintiffs’ arguments before the high court. Their concern over unwarranted delays was shared by the justices.

“The district court found that because the Proposed Intervenors and the State Defendants seek the same objective in the litigation, intervention would risk duplicative and cumulative argument, which would delay the matter to the detriment of the parties,” the opinion states.

Plaintiffs in the larger abortion ban suit include women, health care providers and an aid group. Defendants include the state, governor, attorney general, Teton County sheriff and Jackson’s chief of police.

Justice Lynne Boomgaarden also signaled in a December hearing that she was concerned this appeal to the Wyoming Supreme Court was premature. That’s because the judge in Teton County could determine there were no fact issues in this case — which the intervenors wanted to present evidence on — and issue a summary judgment in favor of one of the parties, effectively deciding the case without a trial.

The history

This group of three initially sought to intervene in the first lawsuit against Wyoming’s “trigger” abortion ban, which was set into motion once Roe v. Wade was overturned.

That ban was challenged in court and, the day it was set to go into effect in July 2022, 9th District Judge Melissa Owens issued a temporary restraining order followed by a preliminary injunction.

Then, Owens denied the trio intervention in that lawsuit, so they appealed her decision to the Wyoming Supreme Court. However, that case was voluntarily dismissed earlier this year after state lawmakers passed two new abortion bans in the 2023 legislative session.

House Bill 152 – Life is a Human Right Act is a near-total abortion ban that replaced the trigger ban. It carves out exceptions for cases of rape, incest or if a mother’s life is threatened. However, plaintiffs in the lawsuit argue that these exceptions can be difficult if not impossible to clearly meet, given reporting requirements and ambiguous medical language.

Senate File 109 – Prohibiting chemical abortions is the state’s second ban. It was the first of its kind in the country that specifically banned medications used to induce abortion. In Wyoming, that was how nearly all reported abortions were performed before Wellspring Health Access opened in April in Casper, providing surgical abortions.

The near-total ban was set to go into effect upon passage while the medication ban was slated to go into effect in July.

A suit was filed against the near-total ban on the day the governor let it go into effect without his signature — March 17 — and Owens stalled its enforcement on March 22. The medication ban was later rolled into that same lawsuit, receiving its own temporary restraining order in June.

Once again, the trio of anti-abortion advocates filed to actively join the lawsuit as intervenors. However, this time they were joined in the fight by Secretary of State Chuck Gray.

Plaintiffs in the case argued that none of them should be allowed to intervene, while the state only specifically argued against Gray joining.

“Public officers such as the Secretary of State ‘have and can exercise only such powers as are conferred to them by law,’” the state’s filing says. “In his official capacity, Secretary of State Gray cannot intervene in this case unless a Wyoming statute authorizes him to do so.”

Gray contended he has standing, but didn’t continue his fight to intervene beyond his initial request.

Owens denied the group intervention in June, and the original three — sans Gray — appealed that decision to the Supreme Court.

As it stands, the lawsuit against Wyoming’s two bans remains in district court in Teton County. Owens is now mulling over dueling requests from the plaintiffs and state for her to rule on their behalf without a trial. She could also decide that a trial is necessary and schedule it for a later date.

Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes

SALT LAKE CITY — As the weather turned from mild to frigid, demonstrators gathered in front of the state Capitol building late Saturday morning to participate in the annual March for Life, sponsored by Pro-Life Utah.

From the granite steps, Mary Taylor, president of Pro-Life Utah, told the crowd, ""Since Roe v. Wade was overturned a year and a half ago the battlegrounds have changed, but abortion still remains a huge problem in Utah.""

""For a year and a half, babies are dying every day,"" Taylor said. ""We've got over 4,800 babies that have died since the injunction, and that's why we march.""

The Supreme Court's June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade prompted enforcement Utah's so-called ""trigger law,"" banning nearly all abortions in the state. But Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the law violated the Utah Constitution. An injunction was granted by District Court Judge Andrew Stone in July 2022 while the case remained in litigation, halting the enforcement of the abortion ban.

According to Stone, Planned Parenthood successfully showed that women who are seeking abortions may be harmed by seeking treatment out of the state or resorting to unsafe means. Planned Parenthood's attorney Julie Murray argued the ""trigger law"" breaches constitutional provisions providing the right to determine one's own family composition, equal rights to men and women, the right to bodily autonomy and the right to privacy.

Pro-Life Utah's director of development, Merrilee Boyack, took the stand Saturday to say ""Make no mistake about it, the people of Utah have blood on their hands. When a baby's life — at whatever stage of growth — is ended, it is not innocent. It is not inconsequential, and it's not a justifiable act.""

Some attendees were drawn to the event through various religious beliefs. The Rev. Tony Masinelli from Grace Lutheran Church initiated the gathering with public prayer. Saint Thomas More Catholic Church was a sponsor of the event. Attendees Harijinder Singh, 45, and his brother were motivated by teachings of their Sikh faith and its founder, Guru Nanak.

Others had personal reasons for attending.

""My mom was told to abort me in 1945, and she said 'no',"" said Jim Timmel, 78. ""It's changing one heart and mind at a time. That's why we're here.""

Brad Bonham, Gov. Spencer Cox's entrepreneur in residence, was a big supporter of the event.

""For us, supporting initiatives around saving lives in the womb, protecting the rights of the unborn, and providing these innocent, small babies the safety and security of being born happy and healthy has been really important to us ever since we lost our son,"" said Bonham, whose infant son died hours after birth due to a kidney condition.

Like Bonham, a nearby mother who attended with her four kids said she became passionate about the issue after losing her first child shortly after he was born.

While marchers circled the Capitol with yellow flags, Boyack said, ""Everybody thinks that abortion went away in Utah, and so it was important for us to stand here and say it's getting worse and we have to take action.""

For over 30 years, Boyak has been crocheting baby blankets for a local pregnancy resource business. ""I think (the march) sends a message not only to our legislators but also to our courts. People are pro-life here in Utah.""

""I think it went very well. It didn't rain. It was a little nippy, but it didn't rain,"" Taylor said after returning from the march. ""I think this year's a little quiet on the pro-life front in the Legislature. We're still on hold waiting to find out what is going to happen with that trigger law, and so things are a little bit quiet. But again, I think it's always useful to show our legislators how much we are behind them.""

Pro-Life released a statement Saturday numbering the crowd at ""more than 1,200 Utahns.""

Jan 24 2024,North Dakota judge refuses to block part of abortion law that puts patients at risk,WCPT,left,https://heartlandsignal.com/2024/01/24/north-dakota-judge-refuses-to-block-part-of-abortion-law-that-puts-patients-at-risk,"An abortion rights demonstrator holds a sign during a rally on May 14, 2022, in Chattanooga, Tenn. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)

On Tuesday, a North Dakota judge refused to block a portion of the state’s strict abortion law, which puts doctors at risk of prosecution for performing abortions to save the life or preserve the health of their patients.

North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) signed one of the strictest abortion bills into law last April, which outlaws the procedure in almost all cases. The law allows slim exceptions for rape and incest, but only prior to six weeks of gestation. An abortion provider and several physicians in the state jointly filed a lawsuit in June challenging the legality of North Dakota’s abortion law.

In November, the plaintiffs also filed a preliminary injunction to block the portion of the law that allows abortion in cases to preserve the health of the mother, which they contended was too vague. However, State District Judge Bruce Romanick refused to block to portion and said the request was “not appropriate.”

“[Physicians face] the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” said the plaintiffs’s attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh."

A rights group called Progress Florida collected enough signatures to bring the issue directly to voters.

“Extreme abortion bans force people to leave the state just to access healthcare and this amendment would limit that interference,” Cheyenne Drews with Progress Florida said.

The state Supreme Court will have to approve the wording in Amendment Four.

It reads, in part, “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.”

At a news conference on Tuesday, doctors weighed in on the issue.

“Politicians have no place in the exam rooms when patients are making these really personal and private decisions about their reproductive health,” said St. Petersburg immunologist Dr. Mona Mangat.

Attorney General Ashley Moody disagrees.

“I happen to believe, very passionately, that life needs to be protected and that lawmakers should have the ability to do that.”

Five of the seven Florida Supreme Court justices were appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who endorses the abortion restrictions.

Wednesday’s hearing on the proposed amendment begins at 9 a.m.

Florida SWAT sniper shoots, kills man who was holding hostages at bank

An attempted bank robbery ends with a man dead in Southwest Florida.

According to the Lee County Sheriff’s Office, a SWAT sniper shot and killed the suspect as he was holding two hostages at knifepoint.

The sheriff announced during a press conference that Sterling Ramon Alavache, 36, entered the Bank of America near South Fort Myers on Tuesday and made a bomb threat before taking those hostages.

Investigators say they tried multiple times to negotiate with the man before ultimately entering the bank.

None of the hostages were hurt.

Florida to conduct statewide tornado drill

Lots of Floridians will get a tornado warning on their phones from the National Weather Service.

It’s a practice run meant to prepare everyone for severe weather. The statewide tornado drill will start around 10 a.m.

That’s when officials want people to take shelter in an enclosed space just as you would during a real warning.

Many school districts, private schools and preschools may be taking part in the drill and several local cities are encouraging everyone to participate but, of course, it is voluntary.

On Tuesday, a North Dakota judge ruled that the state can continue to enforce its abortion ban even in situations where an abortion is necessary to preserve the pregnant person’s life or health—at least for now. The judge denied a request from the Center for Reproductive Rights for an injunction to block the ban from being enforced in medical emergencies amid the organization’s ongoing lawsuit against the state, at least until the district court issues a ruling. (A jury trial is set for August, according to the Associated Press.) In 2023, the Center filed its lawsuit arguing that the medical emergency exception attached to the state’s total abortion ban is too narrow and violates the state’s Constitution.

“Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans,” Meetra Mehdizadeh, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.

In March 2023, the North Dakota state Supreme Court blocked the state’s original abortion ban—a trigger law that took effect once the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022—because the trigger law didn’t provide exceptions to save the pregnant person’s life. A month later, North Dakota Republicans passed a new abortion ban that included a narrow exception for such medical emergencies, which was then signed into law and is now in effect, prompting the Center to file its lawsuit.

In the request for an injunction, the Center asked the judge to prohibit the state from prosecuting physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to offer emergency abortions due to pregnancy-related complications that present “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.” State District Judge Bruce Romanick said on Tuesday that this request “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.”

Doctors and health care providers in North Dakota say they fear criminal charges and prosecution for providing abortion care even to save a pregnant person’s life. “This decision is truly disappointing; North Dakotans can’t be granted even temporary relief as the court hears our case?” Tammi Kromenaker, director of Red River Women’s Clinic—which is a plaintiff in the case—said in a statement following the district court’s decision. “I hate to think that someone is harmed as a result of this denial. Abortion is a medical procedure. It is not a crime. No one should be denied health care they are entitled to.” Red River Women’s Clinic formerly operated in North Dakota but has since moved to Minnesota because of the state’s ban.

The Center for Reproductive Rights is also suing Idaho, Texas, and Tennessee, seeking to clarify the “medical emergency” exceptions attached to their abortion bans. The Center argues that these supposed exceptions are too vague and fail to sufficiently help patients who may face life and health-endangering complications, or protect doctors from criminal liability for offering stabilizing abortion care. In the Center’s lawsuits for these states, plaintiffs include women who experienced severe, potentially life-threatening pregnancy complications and were denied medically necessary abortions. One plaintiff from Tennessee says she suffered “physical and emotional torture” from being forced to carry a nonviable pregnancy for months because she was denied an emergency abortion in Tennessee and couldn’t travel out of state for care.

Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Linda Goldstein told Jezebel earlier this month that there’s a throughline that connects all of these cases. “They show exceptions don’t work—that’s really the bottom line. These exceptions have always just been window-dressing to make abortion bans look reasonable,” Goldstein said. “The language is too vague and too difficult for doctors to be able to apply to save someone’s life—and that’s the entire point.”"
Jan 19 2024,"Thousands brave snow, cold to protest abortion in 51st March for Life",Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/19/thousands-brave-snow-cold-to-protest-abortion-in-5/,"A version of this story appeared in the Higher Ground newsletter from The Washington Times. Click here to receive Higher Ground delivered directly to your inbox each Sunday.





Thousands of pro-life activists braved snow and below-freezing temperatures to protest legalized abortion in the nation’s capital on Friday, walking to the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court.

Protesters at the 51st National March for Life, which is held every year around the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned in June 2022, called for legal restrictions on the procedure with exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother.

But they also expressed a renewed desire to support pregnant women with resources, exhibiting softer rhetoric in the second national march since the high court’s Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling, which returned jurisdiction over abortion to the states.

The theme of this year’s march embodied that pivot: “With Every Woman: For Every Child.”

“Though legislation protecting life remains critical, even more important is the work of changing hearts and minds,” said Jeanne Mancini, president of the March for Life. “That’s why we will continue marching at the state and federal level until our nation’s laws reflect the basic truth that all human life is created equal and is worthy of protection.”

SEE ALSO: WATCH: Go inside the March for Life

This year’s march comes as abortion ranks high as a campaign issue for both sides heading into November’s general election.

President Biden and other Democrats are campaigning on the issue, hoping to capitalize on a mounting backlash against the Supreme Court‘s ruling in Dobbs. Democrats have notched a series of electoral wins since the decision.

The Biden reelection campaign announced Thursday that it would commemorate Monday’s anniversary of the Roe v. Wade ruling with a blitz of ad buys, campaign rallies and events across the nation. The television and digital ads will shine a spotlight on Republican-led abortion restrictions in swing states such as Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Polls since the Dobbs ruling have shown movement away from some anti-abortion positions as some activists push for near-total state abortion bans.

Several Republican pro-life members of Congress spoke at the noon rally on the National Mall, which preceded the march along Constitution Avenue.

They included House Speaker Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey. Both emphasized the work of pregnancy resource centers, the needs of foster children and legislation supporting high-quality health care.

SEE ALSO: Defending life

“We have every reason to be optimistic, my friends, that we can change public opinion,” Mr. Johnson told the cheering crowd.

“Let’s be encouraged, let’s press on and hope that we can join together and make this great difference,” he said. “We can stand with every woman for every child, and we can truly build a culture that cherishes and protects life.”

The lawmakers touted two pro-life bills that the Republican-led House recently passed, including one that would require colleges and universities to inform pregnant students about options other than abortion.

The other bill would preserve federal funding for pregnancy resource centers, which have faced vandalism and increased political attacks since the Dobbs decision.

“There are more than 2,700 pregnancy resource centers throughout the United States — each and every one of them an oasis of love, compassion, empathy, respect and care for both mothers and their precious children,” Mr. Smith added.

Both bills are expected to fail in the Democratic-led Senate, and President Biden is expected to veto any pro-life legislation that reaches his desk.

Mr. Smith touted an annual Knights of Columbus/Marist abortion poll released this week, which found that 83% of adults support pro-life pregnancy resource centers, including 75% of Democrats.

That’s down from 91% in the same poll last year, as advocates of abortion access have targeted the centers with claims that they deceive women seeking abortion services.

Former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson praised the crowd for braving the cold and snow.

“Roe is done, but abortion is still legal and thriving in too much of America,” he said.

Jim Harbaugh, head football coach at the NCAA champion University of Michigan, introduced Mr. Watson as a “warrior for the sanctity of life.”

In their permit applications to the National Park Service, organizers estimated 50,000 marchers for the protest, the same as in past years.

But the raucous crowd Friday appeared smaller than last year’s gathering, perhaps reflecting the harsh weather.

Some marchers played in the snow that fell throughout the day. Others held umbrellas.

One man, 62-year-old Dan Beazley, carried a 10-foot cedar wood cross he constructed in his garage.

“If every person just focused on the message of the cross, they would choose life every time,” said Mr. Beazley, who attends Connection Church near Detroit.

Diego Infante, an 18-year-old freshman at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, came with a group of 13 students to attend his third march.

“I think we have to keep pushing bans across the country, but we also need to support resources for mothers and children,” Mr. Infante said.

Jean Marie Davis, one of the rally speakers, shared her journey from prostitution to motherhood after she visited a pregnancy resource center as a client.

Now the mother of a 9-year-old son and director of Branches Pregnancy Center in Vermont, she called allegations that the centers hide their anti-abortion stance a “false narrative.”

“It’s personal for me because I would have been dead if I hadn’t gone there,” Ms. Davis, 38, told The Washington Times. “They told me about a man named Jesus, and they saved my soul and my life. I had pimps who wanted to kill my child.”

Liberty University, a Christian school in Virginia, bused 1,200 students to this year’s march.

“I feel very deeply about stopping abortion because I’ve seen the emotional turmoil and regrets,” said Cooper Pierson, a 20-year-old Liberty sophomore from West Virginia. “I understand there should be exceptions for rape and molestation, but I think abortion is a matter of convenience for many women.”

The Supreme Court’s decision to return jurisdiction over abortion to the states has led to a patchwork of emerging legislative and legal struggles.

While about half of states have moved to close abortion clinics and limit access to chemical abortion pills, the other half have moved to expand access.

Since the Dobbs ruling, March for Life organizers have enlarged their focus to include statewide marches.

The organization has expanded to include state marches in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, North Dakota and Pennsylvania this year.

Penny Nance, president of the conservative Concerned Women for America, rejected the notion that pro-life activists should back down from legal and legislative battles to restrict abortion nationwide.

“The left thinks we’re back on our heels, but that’s absolutely false,” Ms. Nance said. “This is the time to lean in on the state and maybe federal level, not back down.”

Gracelynn Denning, who traveled from Lynchburg, Virginia, to attend her first march, expressed little enthusiasm for federal restrictions.

“I think we need to focus on supporting foster kids in need and pregnant women who are struggling,” said Ms. Denning, 19. “Legislation needs to be state by state.”

Jan 08 2024,Pro-abortion initiative in Florida obtains signatures to go to the polls,California 18,center,https://california18.com/pro-abortion-initiative-in-florida-obtains-signatures-to-go-to-the-polls/11959772024,"MIAMI .- A political committee that seeks to guarantee the right to abortion in the Constitution of Florida managed to raise the companies necessary to put their proposal to a vote in November. However, strong opposition is expected from the attorney general and other sectors of the Florida state.

As of Saturday morning, more than 911,000 valid signatures to the Florida Division of Elections, bringing the committee above the minimum required of 891,523. Additionally, the group met the requirement of having support in at least 14 of the state’s 28 congressional districts.

Campaign director Lauren Brenzel expressed her satisfaction with the achievement and stated that Floridians want to decide on access to abortion. “They have signed millions and millions of papers to get this initiative on the ballot,” she said.

Abortion regulations

However, the initiative must still pass the filter of the Florida Supreme Court, which will review its wording on February 7. Five of the court’s seven justices have been appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has pushed for measures to regulate abortion.

In this regard, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and other anti-abortion groups asked the court to reject the proposal, alleging that it is “confusing” and “misleading” to voters.

In essence, the proposal states that “No law may prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the health of the patient.according to the discretion of your doctor.”

Opponents question the use of the term “viability,” which can have different interpretations. Generally, ‘fetal viability’ is considered to be around 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Defense of the proposal

Regarding the controversy, Brenzel defended the “clarity” and “conciseness of the language” of the initiative, and accused prosecutor Moody of having alleged political motivations.

“We believe Florida voters deserve to vote on this initiative, because Moody is empty and just wants to make a political statement,” he stated.

The initiative arose in May, after Governor DeSantis and Congress, both Republicans, approved a law that could limit abortion to six weeks of gestation.

Still, this law depends on the outcome of litigation over another 2022 law that set the limit at 15 weeks.

Brenzel said that the 15% of the signatures collected for the petition are from registered Republicans and 25% are voters not affiliated with any party.

The proposed constitutional amendment is framed in a national context of disputes over abortion, following the ruling of the United States Supreme Court that revoked the historic Roe v. ruling in 2022. Wade, who recognized the right to abortion. The ruling left the regulation of abortion in the hands of the states.

If the Florida Supreme Court gives the green light to the proposal, an intense and costly electoral campaign between supporters and opponents of abortion is expected."
Jan 31 2024,Six pro-lifers face up to 10 years in prison for protest outside Tennessee abortion clinic,Washington Times,right,https://washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jan/31/six-pro-lifers-face-up-to-10-years-in-prison-for-p,"Six pro-life activists each face up to a decade in prison after being convicted of violating federal law for a protest at an abortion clinic in Tennessee, a victory for the Biden administration in what foes have decried as a politically motivated crackdown on the pro-life movement.

A federal jury in Nashville found the six defendants guilty of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act during their March 2021 demonstration outside the Carafem Health Center Clinic in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, described by prosecutors as a “clinic blockade.”

“These defendants are being held accountable for unlawfully obstructing access to reproductive health services,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said after Tuesday’s verdict. “The Justice Department will continue to enforce the FACE Act to protect the rights of those who provide and those who seek access to such services.”

The protesters—Chester Gallagher, Heather Idoni, Calvin Zastrow, Coleman Boyd, Paul Vaughn and Dennis Green—also were found guilty of felony conspiracy. They face a maximum of 10-and-a-half years in prison and fines of up to $260,000.

The six are scheduled to be sentenced on July 2, although their attorneys are expected to appeal.

“We are, of course, disappointed with the outcome,” said Steve Crampton, Thomas More Society senior counsel, who represents Vaughn. “This was a peaceful demonstration by entirely peaceable citizens—filled with prayer, hymn-singing, and worship—oriented toward persuading expecting mothers not to abort their babies.”

He said that “the Biden Department of Justice decided to characterize Paul Vaughn’s peaceful actions as a felony ‘conspiracy against rights,’ to intimidate and punish Paul and other pro-life people and people of faith.”

The case has become a flashpoint for abortion foes who accuse the administration of weaponizing the FACE Act against pro-life activists while paying scant attention to the nearly 90 attacks on pro-life pregnancy centers since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

“The FACE Act criminalizes an odd assortment of offenses, including blocking access to and vandalizing (1) abortion clinics, (2) places of worship, and (3) pregnancy centers,” said Sen. Mike Lee, Utah Republican, on X. “How many prosecutions has Team Biden brought in the second category? Zero. Not even one.”

Another four defendants are scheduled to stand trial for misdemeanor FACE Act violations stemming from their participation in the 2021 protest.

“The Biden Department of Justice’s pattern of arresting and prosecuting peaceful pro-life advocates is disturbing,” said Mr. Crampton.

U.S. Attorney Henry C. Leventis for the Middle District of Tennessee said the defendants “knowingly chose to violate laws they disagreed with.”

“The jury’s verdict today is a victory for the rule of law in this country and a reminder that we cannot pick and choose which laws we follow,” he said. “It is also a testament to the outstanding work done in this case by the trial team and our law enforcement partners.”

Video of the protest, which was livestreamed by the activists on Facebook, showed them sitting in front of the clinic door singing.

Police ended up escorting some patients into the clinic. Prosecutors played video clips showing one of the protesters saying that a woman entering the facility was “coming to kill her baby” and that the officer was “leading a baby to be murdered,” the Tennessean reported.

One witness said that she had scheduled an abortion but left “because of the protesters.” A clinic employee said that she was “trapped inside the building,” which the defense disputed, saying that the video “showed traffic clearly passing down the hallway to and from the abortion venue.”

“This is a frustrating setback, for Paul, for his family, and for the extended pro-life community, which has rallied support for Paul from the day of his arrest in front of his wife and children by heavily armed FBI agents, on through the trial,” said Mr. Crampton, referring to Vaughn’s October 2022 arrest at his home.

The six-day trial took place at the Fred D. Thompson U.S. Courthouse and Federal Building in Nashville.

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen rejected a proposed ballot measure seeking to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution, with proponents vowing to appeal the decision.

The Office of the Montana Attorney General issued a memorandum Tuesday regarding Proposed Ballot Measure No. 14, calling it ""legally insufficient"" to be put on the ballot.

The memo contends that the proposal ""creates an express right to abortion but denies voters the ability to express their views on the nuance of the right.""

""Section 36(1) unmoors the right to an abortion from fetal viability. Second, Section 36(2)'s 'in no circumstance' clause prohibits any regulation of abortion care if the abortion provider deems the procedure medically necessary,"" stated the memo.

""This clause makes it so even regulations that serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest cannot survive. … This language also elevates the right to abortion above other medical procedures so that abortion — alone — cannot be regulated.""

According to the memo, Section 36(3) ""would prohibit the State from enforcing any regulation that includes an adverse action against a person.""

""The prohibition on enforcement exists even if the State passed a law that meets the requirements of Section 36(1)–(2). The choice to preclude the State from being able to enforce valid health and safety regulations is different than the choice to expand abortion rights,"" the memo added.

""The contradictory language in the various subsections creates a quandary over the actual decision in front of the voters. … At a minimum, voters are presented with multiple amendments and because of that, Ballot Measure 14 violates Article XIV, Section 11 of the Montana Constitution.""

Raph Graybill, an attorney for Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, the group backing the proposed ballot measure, said in a statement that an appeal would be likely.

""In an attempt to keep an abortion rights initiative out of the hands of voters, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has used the power of his office to put personal politics before a fair process to allow Montanans the opportunity to secure their reproductive rights,"" stated Graybill, as quoted by the Helena-based KTVH.

""Make no mistake: we will do everything we can, including taking legal action, to ensure Montanans have the opportunity to vote to secure their rights to make decisions about their own pregnancies, including the right to abortion care, in 2024.""

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, striking down the legal precedent that abortion was a federal constitutional right.

Since then, voters in some states have either passed referenda that amend their state constitutions to include a right to an abortion or voted down ballot initiates aimed at banning abortion in most circumstances.

Earlier this month, Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected a proposed ballot measure that would create a limited right to abortion because of how the measure defined “physical health.”"

Dec 31 2023,Idaho judge refuses to throw out abortion suit,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,left,https://arkansasonline.com/news/2023/dec/31/idaho-judge-refuses-to-throw-out-abortion-suit,"An Idaho judge on Friday denied a request by the state's top legal chief to throw out a lawsuit seeking to clarify the exemptions tucked inside the state's broad abortion ban.

Instead, 4th District Judge Jason Scott narrowed the case to focus only on the circumstances where an abortion would be allowed and whether abortion care in emergency situations applies to Idaho's state constitutional right to enjoy and defend life and the right to secure safety.

Scott's decision comes just two weeks after a hearing where Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador's office attempted to dismiss the case spearheaded by four women and several physicians, who filed the case earlier this year.

Similar lawsuits are playing out around the nation, with some of them, like Idaho's, brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of doctors and pregnant people who were denied access to abortions while facing serious pregnancy complications.

According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Idaho's Constitution entitles its residents to certain fundamental rights, but a sweeping abortion ban poses a risk to those rights.

Labrador's office countered that the Idaho Supreme Court has already upheld the state's abortion bans -- thus solving any lingering questions on the matter.

Scott agreed in part with the state attorneys that the state Supreme Court ruled there was no fundamental right to abortion inside the state constitution, but added that the court didn't reject ""every conceivable as applied challenge that might be made in a future case.""

""We're grateful the court saw through the state's callous attempt to ignore the pain and suffering their laws are causing Idahoans,"" said Gail Deady, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""Now the state of Idaho will be forced to answer to these women in a court of law.""

Meanwhile, the Idaho judge also sided with the attorney general in removing Gov. Brad Little, Labrador, and the Idaho Board of Medicine as named defendants in the lawsuit -- leaving the state of Idaho as the only remaining defendant. Scott called the long list of defendants ""redundant,"" saying that all three would be subject to whatever is ultimately decided in the lawsuit.

""This is only the beginning of this litigation, but the Attorney General is encouraged by this ruling,"" Labrador's office said in a statement. ""He has long held that the named defendants were simply inappropriate, and that our legislatively passed laws do not violate the Idaho Constitution by narrowly limiting abortions or interfering with a doctor's right to practice medicine.""

The four women named in the case were all denied abortions in Idaho after learning they were pregnant with fetuses that were unlikely to go to term or survive birth, and that the pregnancies also put them at risk of serious medical complications. All four traveled to Oregon or Washington for the procedures.

Idaho has several abortion bans, but notably, Idaho lawmakers approved a ban as a trigger law in March 2020, before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

At the time, any suggestion that the ban could harm pregnant people was quickly brushed off by the bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, who said during one debate that the health of the mother ""weighs less, yes, than the life of the child.""

The trigger ban took effect in 2022. Since then, Idaho's roster of obstetricians and other pregnancy-related specialists has been shrinking."
Jan 30 2024,"Peaceful ‘rescuers’ seeking to stop abortions found guilty by jury, face up to 11 years in prison",Christian News Network,right,https://christiannews.net/2024/01/30/peaceful-rescuers-seeking-to-stop-abortions-found-guilty-by-jury-face-up-to-11-years-in-prison,"(Breitbart) — Six pro-life activists were found guilty on Tuesday for “conspiracy against rights” and violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) in relation to a peaceful protest outside of a Tennessee abortion facility in 2021.

President Joe Biden’s pro-abortion administration announced in October 2022 that it had charged 11 activists involved in the March 5, 2021, “blockade” of the Carafem Health Center Clinic in Mount Juliet. Attorneys for the activists said they were conducting a “rescue” and had gathered on the second floor of the office building where the clinic is located to pray, sing hymns, and urge women not to go through with abortions. The peaceful protest was also live-streamed on Facebook, according to the Catholic News Agency (CNA).

Six of the activists have now been found guilty of a misdemeanor FACE Act charge, as well as a felony conspiracy against rights charge, which carries with it the possibility of up to 11 years in prison and fines up to $250,000. They include: Chester Gallagher, 73, of Lebanon, Tennessee; Heather Idoni, 58, of Michigan; Calvin Zastrow, 57, of Michigan; Coleman Boyd, 51, of Bolton, Mississippi; Dennis Green, 56, of Cumberland, Virginia; and Paul Vaughn, 55, of Centerville, Tennessee.

Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana launched the ballot initiative in November 2023, which would prevent “the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability,” according to the Idaho Capital Sun. Knudsen dismissed the proposal, arguing in a memorandum that it was “legally insufficient” and “logrolls multiple distinct political choices into a single initiative,” the Montana Free Press reported. (RELATED: Supreme Court Rules Red State Abortion Ban Can Stay In Effect)

“Ballot Measure 14 creates an express right to abortion but denies voters the ability to express their views on the nuance of the right,” Knudsen wrote.

Knudsen also claimed that the proposal as written would prevent state lawmakers from imposing any restrictions on abortion if it’s deemed “medically necessary,” according to the Montana Free Press.

“This clause makes it so even regulations that serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest cannot survive,” Knudsen wrote, the Montana Free Press reported.

In addition to prohibiting the government from making laws limiting abortion before “viability,” the ballot initiative would also prevent state officials from enacting any law that would ban abortions in cases deemed necessary to protect the life and health of the mother, according to the Montana Free Press. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a 15-week abortion ban into law in May 2023 that prohibited dilation and evacuation abortions, which typically take place after that point in the pregnancy.

Advocates of the proposal said that they were prepared to take “legal action” if necessary.

“In an attempt to keep an abortion rights initiative out of the hands of voters, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has used the power of his office to put personal politics before a fair process to allow Montanans the opportunity to secure their reproductive rights,” Attorney Raph Graybill told the Montana Free Press Wednesday evening. “Make no mistake: We will do everything we can, including taking legal action, to ensure Montanans have the opportunity to vote to secure their rights to make decisions about their own pregnancies, including the right to abortion care, in 2024.”

Knudsen’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Jan 18 2024,Signature gathering begins for campaign to make some Missouri abortions legal again,Missourinet,center,https://missourinet.com/2024/01/18/signature-gathering-begins-for-campaign-to-make-some-missouri-abortions-legal-again,"A coalition of pro-choice advocates has officially launched its signature gathering campaign to “kick politicians out of the exam room.”

The group, known as Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, is seeking to overturn the state’s near total abortion ban. The effort is expected to include limitations for lawmakers to regulate the procedure after the fetus is viable.

The team effort is a Missouri-led group including the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Planned Parenthood, and Abortion Action Missouri. It begins gathering signatures after a lengthy court battle with Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a Republican running for governor. The legal fight was over the wording used to summarize what the measure would do.

“Politicians in Jefferson City are endangering the lives and wellbeing of the patients I care for, plain and simple. Missouri’s cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care,” said Dr. Iman Alsaden, advisor to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer, Planned Parenthood Great Plains. “Today, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.”

Time will tell if enough signatures can be gathered by the deadline. To get on this year’s election ballot, petitioners must collect more than 170,000 valid signatures by May.

“Pregnant Missourians are in danger – facing some of the highest rates of maternal mortality and without treatment options for life-threatening pregnancy complications. OBGYNs and maternity practices are packing up and moving away to avoid political harassment and criminalization,” a news release from the group said.

The campaign is one of two pro-choice pursuits during this election year. Another signature-gathering campaign has already begun in an effort to add rape and incest exceptions to Missouri’s abortion regulations.

GOP operative Jamie Corley is behind the effort. She is also attempting to legalize abortions up to 12 weeks.

Jan 06 2024,Abortion proposal rejected again by Attorney General Tim Griffin,KNWA,center,https://nwahomepage.com/news/featured-stories/abortion-proposal-rejected-again-by-attorney-general-tim-griffin,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (KNWA/KFTA) — The group wanting to bring forward a ballot measure that would protect abortion access up to 18 weeks after fertilization will have to edit their proposal.

Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected the proposal for the second time on Friday.

Arkansans for Limited Government Committee proposed a ballot language to change abortion ban laws so the Arkansas government can’t prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion services in certain cases.

These cases include rape, incest and fatal fetal anomalies.

Samuel Watson, content director for “For AR People” says the second version is fundamentally the same as their first version.

“That first rejection, he was just asking for some clarification on some terms to use a different standard. Our first version had after gestation, I believe. And so, he wanted us to change that standard,” he said.

This is in response to Arkansas’ total abortion ban that went into effect in June 2022, after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court.

In a three-page letter addressed to another member of the committee, Steven Nichols, Griffin writes that they now need to clarify what they meant by “physical health” and reword the way it appears in the ballot initiative text.

The letter says, “This definition is misleading because it defines “physical health,” not as the absence of disorder, illness, or injury, but as the presence of those things. That is the opposite of the common meaning of “health.”

Watson says they are passionate about this issue and it is important to have this ballot initiative.

“It would allow doctors to provide that lifesaving care. It would allow and not only provide lifesaving care, it would allow them to protect the health and future fertility of mothers,” he said.

He also says it would prevent stories like Kate Cox’s in Texas.

According to reproductiverights.org, Cox needed an abortion to protect her health and future fertility after her fetus was diagnosed with a severe fetal anomaly in her second trimester.

She left the state to get the procedure after the Texas Supreme Court denied emergency abortion care.

Watson says, “We just don’t think that the legislators need to be in the exam room. It should be between doctors and their patients.”

Despite the rejection, Watson says it makes them feel hopeful.

He also says they are trying to resubmit as soon as possible. Griffin will then have 10 business days to respond and then they will have to get about 90,000 signatures before July 5th.

If everything goes as planned for the committee, you will see this on your ballot in Nov."

Wade, Friday, June 24, 2022, in Austin, Texas.

Wade was overturned last year. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)

A Texas judge on Thursday said a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis could legally obtain an abortion despite the state’s bans.

The judge, Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County district court, granted Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, permission to terminate her pregnancy, issuing a temporary restraining order to permit a doctor to perform the abortion without facing civil or criminal penalties under the state law.

Cox’s case is believed to be among the first attempts to seek a court-approved abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be pregnant, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability, is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” the judge said at the hearing. “So I will be signing the order, and it will be processed and sent out today.”

Cox, 31, sued the state on Tuesday seeking an emergency court order to allow her doctor to perform an abortion after learning her fetus had a lethal condition and no chance of survival. Due to Cox’s medical history, her OB-GYNs warned her that continuing to carry the pregnancy could jeopardize her health and future fertility.

The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the case—Cox v. Texas—on Cox’s behalf. They released this statement after the ruling in her favor:

“Today’s decision underscores what we already know—abortion is essential health care. While we are grateful that Kate will be able to get this urgent medical care, it is unforgivable that she was forced to go to court to ask for it in the middle of a medical emergency,” said Molly Duane, Senior Staff Attorney at the Center. “Most women are not able to do what Kate has done—many Texans have been forced to continue pregnancies that put their lives at risk. That is happening every day across Texas. As long as abortion is banned, pregnant people will suffer. As we await the Texas Supreme Court’s ruling in Zurawski v. State of Texas, our hearts go out to the countless people in similar situations who—who for so many reasons—aren’t able to sue the state of Texas for an emergency hearing.”

The office of Attorney General Ken Paxton released this statement Thursday afternoon: “The Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) granted by the Travis County district judge purporting to allow an abortion to proceed will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws. This includes first degree felony prosecutions, Tex. Health & Safety Code § 170A.004, and civil penalties of not less than $100,000 for each violation, Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 170A.005, 171.207-211. And, while the TRO purports to temporarily enjoin actions brought by the OAG and TMB against Dr. Karsan and her staff, it does not enjoin actions brought by private citizens. Tex. Health & Safety Code § ¬¬171.207. Nor does it prohibit a district or county attorney from enforcing Texas’ pre-Roe abortion laws against Dr. Karsan or anyone else. The TRO will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires.”

Jan 05 2024,Group gets enough signatures to put abortion on Florida ballot,WFLA,center,https://wfla.com/mobile/group-gets-enough-signatures-to-put-abortion-on-florida-ballot,"TAMPA (WFLA) — A proposed amendment that would protect the right to abortion in Florida has gathered enough signatures to be put on the 2024 ballot.

The Floridians Protecting Freedom campaign said it exceeded the 891,523 signatures needed to place the amendment on the ballot.

“The fact that we only launched our campaign eight months ago and we’ve already reached our petition goal speaks to the unprecedented support and momentum there is to get politicians out of our private lives and health care decisions,” said Campaign Director Lauren Brenzel. “Most initiative campaigns never make it this far. The ones that do usually spend far more or take much longer to qualify, which is why we’re so confident that voters will approve our amendment once they’re given a chance to vote.”

The Florida Division of Elections said the amendment has received 911,029 valid signatures, but noted the Secretary of State still needs to certify the signatures and issue a certificate of ballot position for the amendment to be placed on the ballot.

“Being denied the fundamental right to make decisions about pregnancy and healthcare,” said obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Shelly Tien. “As is increasingly the case in Florida, means that you are not free at all.”

Despite gathering the necessary signatures, the proposed amendment also needs the Florida Supreme Court to refuse Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody’s request that they disqualify the amendment, saying the language may confuse voters.

“It’s clear to us that the Attorney General’s position is a disingenuous argument by a politician desperate to block Floridians from voting on this amendment,” said attorney Helene Barthelemy.

The amendment would explicitly protect abortion access until viability, estimated at around 24 weeks. This would override the state’s 15-week abortion ban and the 6-week ban lawmakers approved in April.

The Floridians Protecting Freedom campaign is backed by organizations like ACLU Florida, Planned Parenthood, and the Florida Women’s Freedom Coalition.

“We’re asking all pro-life leaders across the state to really unify in opposition to this amendment,” said Scott Mahurin.

Mahurin is the director of the anti-abortion nonprofit Florida Preborn Rescue.

“What we’re trying to do is advocate for protecting every life,” Mahurin said. “Protecting every person that’s created.”

He said he wasn’t surprised pro-choice groups got enough signatures, but added that passing the amendment is an uphill battle.

“It really opens the floodgates without many restrictions,” Mahurin said. “For going into viability and all these different topics that are hotly debated.”

Oral arguments for the Supreme Court challenge are set for February 7."
Dec 09 2023,Suit challenges Kentucky abortion ban,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/dec/09/suit-challenges-kentucky-abortion-ban,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman in Kentucky filed a lawsuit Friday demanding the right to an abortion, the second legal challenge in days to sweeping abortion bans that have taken hold in more than a dozen U.S. states since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.

The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, says Kentucky's near-total prohibition of abortion violates the plaintiff's rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is about eight weeks pregnant, and she wants to have an abortion in Kentucky but cannot legally do so because of the state's ban, the suit said. She is seeking class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion.

""I am a proud Kentuckian and I love the life my family and I have here, but I'm angry that now that I'm pregnant and do not want to be, the government is interfering in my private matters and blocking me from having an abortion. This is my decision, not the government or any other person's,"" the plaintiff said in a statement released by the American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups backing her challenge.

Republican state Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office said it was reviewing the suit but offered no other comments. Cameron's office has defended the state's anti-abortion laws in other court proceedings.

The latest legal challenge was denounced as ""meritless"" by The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion. Its executive director, David Walls, called it ""absolutely absurd"" for abortion rights groups to say Kentucky's constitution ""somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being.""

The filing in Kentucky comes a day after a judge in Texas gave a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion. The temporary restraining order issued Thursday stops Texas from enforcing the state's ban on the woman, who is 20 weeks pregnant, and lasts for 14 days. Her attorneys afterward spoke cautiously about any wider impacts, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton insisted that the order would not insulate any medical practitioners from any civil or criminal liability.

Paxton appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court on Friday, urging justices to act swiftly.

Kate Cox's attorneys have said they will not disclose her plans, citing safety concerns.

Unlike the case in Texas, little is known about the Kentucky plaintiff or her pregnancy. Legal challenges currently taking place across the country have largely highlighted the stories from women who were denied abortions while facing harrowing pregnancy complications.

But in Kentucky, the plaintiff's attorneys insisted they would fiercely protect their client's privacy, stressing that Jane Doe believes ""everyone should have the right to make decisions privately and make decisions for their own families,"" said Amber Duke, executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky.

Earlier this year, Kentucky's Supreme Court refused to halt the state's near-total abortion ban and another outlawing abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. The justices focused on narrow legal issues but didn't resolve larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State.

The ACLU, Planned Parenthood and other activists say they've been searching for a plaintiff ever since that February ruling. The suit filed Friday marks the launch of their new assault against the state's abortion bans.

""These bans have harmed countless Kentuckians since going into effect last year, and we are relieved to be back in court to try to restore abortion access in Kentucky,"" Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said in the news release.

Jan 25 2024,2 States Have Introduced Abortion ‘Trafficking’ Laws to Prosecute People for Helping Minors Get Care,Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/2-states-have-introduced-abortion-trafficking-laws-to-1851197353,"2 States Have Introduced Abortion ‘Trafficking’ Laws to Prosecute People for Helping Minors Get Care It’s part of anti-abortion lawmakers’ ongoing goal to trap people in their states and under abortion bans.

Two new states have introduced so-called “abortion trafficking” laws that would criminalize anyone who helps a minor travel for abortion care. On Monday, Republican legislators in Tennessee and Oklahoma filed nearly identical bills that match a law that briefly went into effect in Idaho last year but was blocked in court in November.

Tennessee’s bill, SB 1971, states that an adult who “recruits, harbors, or transports a pregnant unemancipated minor within this state for the purpose of” helping them access “criminal abortion” has committed “the offense of abortion trafficking of a minor”—even if they travel to a state where abortion is legal. Oklahoma’s bill uses this same language verbatim. Tennessee’s bill classifies “abortion trafficking” as a Class C felony punishable with up to 15 years in prison, while Oklahoma’s bill would punish offenders with up to five years in prison. Both bills also punish adults who help minors access medication abortion pills.

Tennessee’s bill states that a minor consenting to travel with their trusted adult to obtain abortion doesn’t offer “defense to a prosecution.” It also goes a step further and would make adults charged under the law vulnerable to civil lawsuits from the minor’s parents unless the unwanted pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.

The bills supposedly only target people who help minors travel out-of-state for abortion care without parental consent and don’t apply to children’s parents and legal guardians. Tennessee state Rep. Jason Zachary (R) has explicitly said his bill “doesn’t involve any parents’ decision making for their children” and just “protects children.” Of course, in reality, the bill could target and imprison aunts, grandparents, and other adult loved ones who try to help a child with an unwanted pregnancy. As Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi have pointed out, “abortion trafficking” laws also target minors who may not have supportive relationships with their parents: “Most minors involve a parent in their decision to get an abortion. But for young people living in abusive households, disclosing sexual activity or pregnancy can trigger physical or emotional abuse, including direct physical or sexual violence, or being thrown out of the home,” Ashley Coffield, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi, said in a press release. “This bill makes criminals out of trusted adults, including other family members, who can help in these circumstances.”

Coffield continued, “Targeting trusted adults, family members, and helpers who assist minors in accessing abortion will have a chilling effect and is dangerous and irresponsible. If you know a minor who miscarries, you’re a potential suspect.”

Kiki Council, a Colorado-based attorney who helps minors travel out-of-state for abortion care without parental consent—which requires judicial bypass, or permission from a judge—told Jezebel last year that “minors who can’t tell their parents about their choice are in very precarious, vulnerable positions at home.”

That two states have filed these bills in the first month of the year is chilling, especially as legal experts last year warned that “abortion trafficking” is Republicans’ next play to stop anyone from even helping young people get abortions—and, in the future, stop anyone from traveling out-of-state for care. In August, Alabama’s Republican attorney general Steve Marshall called the act of helping anyone travel for abortion care a “criminal conspiracy.”

“Their goal has always been to stop everyone, nationwide, from getting abortion, and put this vital health care out of reach full-stop,” Andrew Beck, senior attorney at the ACLU’s Reproductive Freedom Project, told Jezebel last April of Idaho’s abortion trafficking bill. At the time, Elisabeth Smith, state policy director at the Center for Reproductive Rights, likened Idaho’s bill to a wave of bills across the country to police the dissemination of information about abortion, prohibit mailing abortion pills, and any other acts that could help someone access abortion. The goal of these laws, she explained, is to trap people in their states, under abortion bans."

FLORIDA — The state's highest court is set to hear oral arguments next month regarding adding abortion rights to Florida ballot, the Florida Supreme Court said Wednesday.

The supreme court released the docket, which shows the hearing scheduled for 9 a.m. Wednesday, Feb. 7. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody and several others are set to make arguments. Raymer Francis Maguire and Floridians Protecting Freedom are listed sponsors of an amendment campaign to secure abortion rights in Florida, per court records and Axios Tampa Bay.

Floridians Protecting Freedom reported Friday obtaining more than 860,000 petition signatures needed by Feb. 1 to add abortion on the ballot, bringing the Sarasota-based organization close to its goal of 1 million signatures by 97 percent. Currently, Florida's 15-week abortion ban is being challenged, the Florida Senate said in September. If the supreme court decides to uphold the ban, the Senate said a six-week ban that Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law in April will take effect.

""Advocates from Floridians Protecting Freedom, including Leader Book and the Reproductive Freedom Collective of Broward – are fighting to put abortion on the ballot in 2024 to give voters the power to protect abortion rights until viability. The group has gathered more than 700,000 signed petitions – more than half of the nearly 1 million needed,"" the Senate said in a September news release.

Dec 08 2023,Judge in Texas lets abortion proceed,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/dec/08/judge-in-texas-lets-abortion-proceed,"AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas judge on Thursday gave a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion in an unprecedented challenge over bans that more than a dozen states have enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The lawsuit by Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, is believed to be the first time since the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision last year that a woman has asked a court to approve an abortion. The order only applies to Cox, and her attorneys afterward spoke cautiously about any wider impacts, calling it unfeasible that scores of other women seeking abortions would also now turn to courts.

""This can't be the new normal,"" said Marc Hearron, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""I don't think you can expect to see now hundreds of cases being filed on behalf of patients. It's just not realistic.""

State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, granted a temporary restraining order allowing Cox to have an abortion under what are narrow exceptions to Texas' ban. Her attorneys said they would not disclose what Cox was planning to do next, citing safety concerns.

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, whose office argued that Cox does not meet the criteria for a medical exception, issued a statement that did not say whether the state would appeal. But in a letter to three Houston hospitals, Paxton warned that legal consequences were still possible if Cox's physician provided the abortion.

Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, attended the hearing via Zoom along with her husband but did not address the court. Doctors have told Cox that if the baby's heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of an uterine rupture because of her prior cesarean sections, and that another C-section at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.

""The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Gamble said.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox, has said this lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Since that landmark ruling, Texas and 12 other states rushed to ban abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy. Opponents have sought to weaken those bans, including an ongoing Texas challenge over whether the state's law is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications.

""I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy or continue to put my body or my mental health through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,"" Cox wrote in an editorial published in The Dallas Morning News. ""I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.""

The temporary restraining order stops Texas from enforcing the state's ban on Cox and lasts for 14 days. Under the restrictions in Texas, doctors who provide abortions could face criminal charges that carry a punishment of up to life in prison. They could also be fined. Pregnant women cannot be criminally charged for having an abortion in Texas.

Paxton told the Houston hospitals the order ""will not insulate you"" from civil and criminal liabilities, arguing that private citizens could still bring lawsuits and local prosecutors could still bring charges.

Jan 19 2024,"In snowy DC, the March for Life rallies against abortion with an eye toward the November elections",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/march-for-life-abortion-f76359375980d9e3bfaf61262c5bf46a,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of opponents of abortion rights rallied under falling snow on Friday at the annual March for Life, as speakers urged the impassioned crowd to capitalize on the movement’s major victory in the Supreme Court and keep fighting until abortion is eliminated.

Months before a presidential election that could be heavily influenced by abortion politics, anti-abortion activists packed the National Mall carrying signs with messages such as “Life is precious” and “I am the pro-life generation.” After listening to speeches, the crowd, braving frigid temperatures, marched past the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court. One group planted in front of Court, beating a drum and chanting: “Everyone you know was once an embryo.”

Friday’s March for Life is the second such event in the nation’s capital since the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling that ended the federal protection for abortion rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade. Last year’s march was triumphant, with organizers relishing a state-by-state fight in legislatures around the country.

Speakers praised the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade but said it was more important now than ever to keep up the pressure on lawmakers to advance abortion restrictions.

“Roe is done, but we still live in a culture that knows not how to care for life,” said Benjamin Watson, a former NFL player who is now an anti-abortion advocate. “Roe is done, but the factors that drive women to seek abortions are ever apparent and ever increasing. Roe is done, but abortion is still legal and thriving in too much of America.”

Friday’s event appeared smaller than in past years as ice and snow complicated travel plans. But the crowd was fired up as speakers, which included members of Congress and Michigan University Football Coach Jim Harbaugh, urged participants to keep fighting until abortion becomes “unthinkable.”

“Let’s be encouraged, let’s press on and hope that we can join together and make this great difference,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. “We can stand with every woman for every child, and we can truly build a culture that cherishes and protects life.”

The snow fell heavily throughout the speeches as young people built snowmen and had snowball fights behind the stage. Near the Capitol, the crowd celebrated as a group on a balcony of the Cannon House Office building cheered on the march.

“I almost didn’t come when I saw the forecast, but this is just incredible,” said Stephanie Simpson, a 42-year-old grocery store employee from Cleveland, who has attended the last four marches.

Roberto Reyes, a Mexican native and Carmelite friar, said: “All these people are going to remember this year’s march for the rest of their lives!”

Members of the crowd described overturning Roe v. Wade as a victory, but said the anti-abortion fight rages on.

“The key message this year is that our work is not done,” said Bishop Michael Burbidge, chair of the committee for pro-life activities for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The movement has seen mixed results. The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization reverted abortion lawmaking back to the states, and 14 states are now enforcing bans on abortion throughout pregnancy. Two more have such bans on hold because of court rulings. And another two have bans that take effect when cardiac activity can be detected, about six weeks into pregnancy — often before women know they’re pregnant.

But abortion restrictions have also lost at the ballot box in Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky. And total bans have produced high-profile causes for abortion rights supporters to rally around. Kate Cox, a Texas mother of two, sought an abortion after learning the baby she was carrying had a fatal genetic condition. Her request for an exemption from Texas’ ban, one of the country’s strictest, was denied by the state Supreme Court, and she left Texas to seek an abortion elsewhere.

Movement organizers now expect abortion rights to be a major Democratic rallying cry in President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign.

“The pro-abortion forces, that’s one of the major things they’re going to run on,” said Susan Swift, president of Pro-Life Legal and a veteran anti-abortion activist. “That’s one of the only things that seems to animate their base.”

Biden campaign officials openly state that they plan to make Biden synonymous with the fight to preserve abortion rights.

Vice President Kamala Harris has led the charge on the issue for the White House. She will hold the first event in Wisconsin on Monday, which would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion.

Jan 13 2024,Kansans voted to protect abortion rights. Republicans are still trying to ban them.,Mother Jones,left,https://motherjones.com/politics/2024/01/kansans-voted-to-protect-abortion-rights-republicans-are-still-trying-to-ban-them,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

In August 2022, Kansans decisively voted to protect reproductive rights, rejecting a proposed constitutional amendment from pro-life groups that said there was no right to abortion in the state. Fifty-nine percent of Kansans voted to safeguard access to abortion, providing an early sign of the unpopularity of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, even in many red states.

But Kansas Republicans are now trying to overturn the will of the state’s voters. Eight Kansas House Republicans introduced a bill this week that would ban all abortions except those necessary to save the patient’s life, forbid the distribution of drugs that end pregnancies, and allow individuals to file suits against doctors or anyone who helps someone get an abortion.

“We had a vote in August, and it was pretty overwhelming,” Justice Dan Biles responded. “That’s the elephant in the room.”

The legislation seems to be in direct conflict with rulings by the state supreme court, which held in 2019 that access to abortion is a “fundamental” right in the state. Kansas Republicans have repeatedly tried to override the 2022 vote that affirmed the state supreme court’s finding, with Solicitor General Tony Powell telling the court’s justices in March 2023 that the August vote “doesn’t matter.” A majority of the justices expressed skepticism of that position.

“We had a vote in August, and it was pretty overwhelming,” Justice Dan Biles responded. “That’s the elephant in the room.”

Republicans have a two-thirds supermajority in both houses of the state legislature, which means they can override the vetoes of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly. But given the clear holding of the state supreme court, the new bill is unlikely to advance. Even the state’s largest anti-abortion group, Kansans for Life, says it has “zero chance of becoming law.” Current Kansas law allows an abortion until 22 weeks into a pregnancy.

Kansas is just one example of how Republicans across the country are trying to short-circuit the democratic process to restrict abortion rights. Last August, Ohio Republicans tried to make it much harder to pass ballot initiatives in the state. GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose admitted it was “100% about keeping a radical pro-abortion amendment out of our constitution.”

Like in Kansas, the measure to curb direct democracy was handily defeated. In November 2023, 57 percent of Ohioans voted to pass a constitutional right to an abortion.

The votes in Kansas and Ohio are part of a larger trend. Seven states have voted directly on abortion since the end of Roe and in all seven states abortion rights advocates have won."

Jan 06 2024,SCOTUS Blocks Biden Admin's ER Doctor Abortion Rule in Idaho,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/06/supreme-court-blocks-biden-admins-attempt-to-force-idaho-er-doctors-to-perform-abortions,"The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho’s law banning abortions except to save the life of the mother to go into effect amid a challenge from the pro-abortion Biden administration.

The High Court also agreed to hear the case in April, which surrounds the Biden administration’s attempt to require emergency room doctors to perform abortions under its new interpretation of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had invented a constitutional right to abortion, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued guidance claiming that EMTALA requires doctors to perform abortions on patients in emergency rooms when it is “the stabilizing treatment necessary” to help in a medical emergency. Under the guidance, hospitals not in compliance could lose funding and the ability to participate in Medicaid.

After the HHS issued its guidance in July of 2022, the Biden administration sued the State of Idaho over its pro-life law, alleging that it is not in compliance with the federal government’s reading of EMTALA. A district court blocked the state’s pro-life law, an order which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stayed. But within days, the en banc Ninth Circuit vacated its panel’s stay opinion and granted en banc review. The State of Idaho then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.

Idaho is arguing that Congress did not write EMTALA to require emergency room physicians to perform abortions. Instead, the state is arguing that the law’s original intent was to prevent “patient dumping,” when hospitals refuse to treat patients who are unable to pay for emergency services. The law, as written by Congress, explicitly requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care for both pregnant women and their unborn babies in emergencies, regardless of whether they are able to pay for services, and makes no mention of abortion.

Idaho’s emergency application to the High Court reads{

EMTALA does not even mention abortion. That statutory silence alone is powerful evidence that Congress did not intend to preempt state abortion laws, particularly given EMTALA’s savings clause. It would be odd indeed if Congress had tucked authority to negate the enforcement of state abortion laws in a relatively obscure provision of the Medicare Act. And of course, President Reagan and Congress enacted no such thing in 1986. Rather, the United States seeks to discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power to regulate abortion, claiming for itself a power to address one of the most contentious social, political, and cultural decisions without a word to that effect from Congress.

The United States is arguing that Idaho’s pro-life law — which makes it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion unless it is necessary to prevent her death — is narrower than its reading of EMTALA. It should be noted that Idaho law does not consider removal of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy as elective abortion.

“That exception is narrower than EMTALA, which by its terms protects patients not only from imminent death but also from emergencies that seriously threaten their health,” the reply brief reads. “Idaho law thus criminalizes care required by federal law: Under Section 18-622, an emergency room physician who concludes that a pregnant woman needs an abortion to stabilize a condition that would otherwise threaten serious and irreversible harm may not provide the necessary care unless and until the patient’s condition deteriorates to the point where an abortion is needed to save her life.”

The Supreme Court’s decision to take up the case comes just days after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit blocked the HHS EMTALA guidance in Texas.

“EMTALA does not mandate any specific type of medical treatment, let alone abortion,” Judge Kurt Engelhardt wrote for a three-judge panel. “We agree with the district court that EMTALA does not provide an unqualified right for the pregnant mother to abort her child especially when EMTALA imposes equal stabilization obligations.”

“The question before the court is whether EMTALA, according to HHS’s Guidance, mandates physicians to provide abortions when that is the necessary stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition. It does not. We therefore decline to expand the scope of EMTALA,” he wrote.

President Joe Biden’s White House decried the Supreme Court’s decision to allow Idaho’s abortion law to go into effect in a statement on Friday. Biden said:

Today’s Supreme Court order allows Idaho’s extreme abortion ban to go back into effect and denies women critical emergency abortion care required by federal law. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has enabled Republican elected officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans like this one that continue to jeopardize women’s health, force them to travel out of state for care, and make it harder for doctors to provide care, including in an emergency. These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America. The Vice President and I believe that health care decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law. As this case continues, the stakes could not be higher for women across America. Congress must immediately restore the protections of Roe v. Wade so that women in every state can access the health care they need.

In contrast, Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador issued a statement celebrating the Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case.

“We are very pleased and encouraged by the Supreme Court’s decision today. The federal government has been wrong from day one. Federal law does not preempt Idaho’s Defense of Life Act. In fact, EMTALA and Idaho’s law share the same goal: to save the lives of all women and their unborn children,” Labrador said. “Today, the Supreme Court’s decision is a big step in stopping the administration’s lawless overreach. The people of Idaho have spoken with clarity on the issue of life.”

The case is Idaho v. United States, No. 23A470 in the Supreme Court of the United States."
Jan 06 2024,"SCOTUS: Idaho can enforce abortion ban, even in medical emergencies",Bonner County Daily Bee,center,https://bonnercountydailybee.com/news/2024/jan/06/scotus-idaho-to-enforce-abortiion-ban,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues.

The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration.

Hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there's a state law banning abortion, the administration argued.

The legal fight followed the court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and allow states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The Biden administration issued guidance about the law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later.

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state.

Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.

The administration argues that EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions.

Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections.

“For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court.

The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief.

Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush.

The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, also a Trump appointee. Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration's view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.”

After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and had set arguments in the case for late January.

The justices' order on Friday takes the case away from the appeals court. A decision is expected by early summer."
Dec 22 2023,Conservatives try to stop the bleeding on abortion ballot measures,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/conservatives-stop-abortion-ballot-measures,"

As more states have passed ballot measures expanding access to abortion, conservative lawmakers and activists have been trying to mitigate the damage by passing laws to govern them and filing lawsuits to challenge them.

Since the overturn of Roe v. Wade, legal abortion activists have successfully ushered along state constitutional amendments that supersede laws restricting abortions in several states.

TRUMP LEGAL WOES COME BARRELING TOWARD SUPREME COURT ON THREE KEY FRONTS AHEAD OF 2024

Many of those amendments have been written vaguely by activists, opponents say, which gives the amendments expansive power and opens them to a wide range of interpretation, such as including phrases such as “reproductive freedom” that could extend legal protections to sex-change operations.

While Democrats in several states have advanced laws ensuring that sex-change interventions have explicit legal protection, Republicans in Ohio, Michigan, and Kansas have been trying to counter the expansion of such laws beyond abortion access by passing laws that weaken the scope and implementation of the amendments.

These legislative counters come as at least 11 states could see similar measures on their ballots in the 2024 general election.

Ohio



Ohio voters recently passed an amendment to their state constitution expanding abortion access and overriding the “heartbeat bill” passed by the legislature and signed by Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH). So-called heartbeat bills get their titles from their ban on abortions after doctors can detect a fetal heartbeat, which is typically around six weeks of pregnancy.

The 14-point vote in favor of the amendment dealt a blow to opponents of legal abortion, but some legislators in Ohio are trying to make sure the legislature has the final say over its interpretation.

A group of state representatives led by Republican Rep. Jennifer Gross is looking to introduce legislation that would give the state General Assembly “the exclusive authority over implementing Issue 1,” which would deny the ability for state courts to interpret the amendment and “immediately dismiss” all lawsuits regarding implementation.

It would also charge judges with a misdemeanor if they did not comply, which could in theory lead to their impeachment.

“To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts with Issue 1, Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative,” a press release from the four Ohio Republicans said. “The Ohio legislature alone will consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws based on public hearings and input from legal experts on both sides.”

After the passage of Ohio’s amendment, abortion providers and activists who were already in court over the heartbeat bill filed a new motion to strike down the law in light of the measure, which took effect Dec. 7.

In addition to legislative action, Buckeye State Republican Senate President Matt Huffman promised a “revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1,” according to his spokesman.

Republican state House Speaker Jason Stephens similarly added that there are “multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life,” saying the amendment is “not the end of the conversation.”

Michigan



Last year, Michigan passed Proposal 3, which enshrined abortion access into the state constitution. It has since been used by Democrats to expand the legal authority of the amendment beyond abortion access, with Democratic lawmakers eyeing an end to parental consent laws that prevent children from seeking abortions.

Getting rid of parental consent laws has been a consequence of nearly all such ballot initiatives.

Last month, Right to Life and three Michigan Republican lawmakers filed a federal lawsuit asking the court to halt implementation of Proposal 3.

The lawsuit said Michigan’s amendment creates a “super right” to abortion in violation of the First and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the guarantee clause, which protects the public’s right to a republican form of government.

“At no time in our nation’s history has such a super-right, immune from all legislative action, ever been created by a popular vote outside of the checks and balances of a republican form of government,” the lawsuit said.

Kansas



Sunflower State voters rejected, by nearly 18 points, a ballot initiative last year to remove language guaranteeing abortion in the state’s constitution.

After the defeat for abortion opponents, conservative lawmakers filed 20 pieces of legislation to restrict the procedure in the state, many of which were vetoed by Gov. Laura Kelly (D-KS).

However, the state legislature overrode Kelly’s vetoes on measures that included criminal penalties for abortion doctors and the requirement to inform users of chemical abortion pills that a reversal treatment exists in progesterone. Supporters of legal abortion, including medical groups that advocate the procedure, have attempted to discredit the efficacy of progesterone despite evidence to the contrary.

Some laws passed versions of a “born alive” act, requiring doctors to engage in lifesaving care in the event of a botched abortion, as well as mandating funding to counseling centers that advocate alternatives to abortion.

Jan 05 2024,Supreme Court allows Idaho to enforce emergency room abortion ban,New York Post (News),right,https://nypost.com/2024/01/05/news/supreme-court-allows-idaho-to-enforce-emergency-room-abortion-ban,"The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its abortion ban while it considers whether emergency room doctors can legally use the procedure in order to stabilize a patient.

A lower court had blocked Idaho’s abortion ban in hospital emergencies after a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration argued that doctors must comply with the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).

The 1986 federal law requires ER physicians to provide an abortion when necessary as part of stabilizing treatment for an emergency medical condition.

The US Department of Health and Human Services issued guidance about the law two weeks after the Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the Biden administration sued Idaho a month later.

“For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in the Biden administration’s filing with the Supreme Court.

Idaho can enforce its abortion ban while the Supreme Court waits to hear the case, the high-court justices decided Friday. AP

The Biden administration sued Idaho in 2022, arguing that ER doctors must be allowed perform abortion if needed to stabilize a patient. AP

Lower courts have reached conflicting decisions on whether states with near-total abortion bans can outlaw the procedure if needed to stabilize a patient in an emergency room setting.

US District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho sided with the Biden administration, while in Texas, a panel of judges on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that EMTALA does not compel doctors to provide abortions.

“EMTALA does not mandate medical treatments, let alone abortion care, nor does it preempt Texas law,” the three-judge panel — all appointed by Republican presidents — concluded in the Texas case.

“We therefore decline to expand the scope of EMTALA,” the ruling stated.

Idaho’s abortion law punishes anyone who performs or assists in an abortion with up to five years in prison. It allows exceptions for instances in which the life of the woman is in danger and for victims of rape and incest.

The high court will hear oral arguments in the case in April."

Dec 11 2023,Kate Cox flees Texas to seek abortion,Mother Jones,left,https://motherjones.com/politics/2023/12/kate-cox-flees-texas-to-seek-abortion,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

Update, December 11: The Texas Supreme Court overturned the lower court order on Monday, ruling against Kate Cox, her husband, and the medical team, hours after Cox announced she fled the state for emergency abortion care. In the seven-page ruling, the court said that doctors had not proven “that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”

Kate Cox, the woman at the center of a Texas court case to terminate her pregnancy for medical reasons, has been forced to leave the state for care, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

Last week, Cox filed a petition for a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of Texas’ near total abortion ban so she could undergo an emergency termination of her pregnancy. ​​Cox’s petition was the first time since Roe was decided in 1973 that an adult pregnant person asked a court for permission to get an abortion.

In a historic ruling, lower court Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said Cox could receive the care. But within hours, state Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a threatening letter to the employers of Cox’s doctor. “We feel it is important for you to understand the potential long-term implications if you permit such an abortion to occur at your facility,” the letter said. Paxton then appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court.

Late Friday night, one day after Cox was granted permission to terminate her pregnancy, the Supreme Court justices temporarily stayed the lower court ruling leaving Cox in a holding pattern, waiting to see if she could get an abortion in Texas.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.”

The Center for Reproductive Rights, who is representing Cox, are not disclosing her whereabouts as she seeks care out of state.

On Monday evening, the Texas Supreme Court said that doctors had not proven “Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires,” ruling against Cox.

Cox, who is around 21 weeks pregnant, is terminating for medical reasons in a wanted pregnancy. In late November, she learned that her fetus was diagnosed with full trisomy 18, ​​a chromosomal disorder that causes fetuses to die before or soon after birth. Each day that passes is a risk to her health. The pregnancy, her petition read, “puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

Texas’ current law calls on providers to exercise “reasonable medical judgment” in ascertaining if the pregnant person “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy” that poses “risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.” Cox’s providers, in the initial appeal to the lower court, said they did not know if they were legally protected under the state’s medical exceptions to the abortion ban, and said their “hands are tied” on such matters.

The Texas Supreme Court is currently considering another case brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights about medical exceptions to the state’s abortion ban. The Center is representing 20 patients and two doctors in Zurawski v. State of Texas. Their lawsuit argues that the abortion ban’s language about medical exceptions is too vague for providers and will harm pregnant people.

The case is the first time that directly impacted pregnant people have sued their state over a post-Roe law.

How the Texas Supreme Court responds to these two overlapping cases will have an immense impact across the country, as pregnant people and their allies consider bringing challenges to their state-level bans on access to life-saving and affirming healthcare. The Center has brought similar suits in Tennessee, Idaho, and Oklahoma.

“She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family,” Northup said today. “While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”

For pregnant people like Kate Cox, traveling out of state is medically dangerous. Pregnancy-related complications like the ones that she’s been enduring can require immediate care, and hours-long journeys without clear hospital availability can be life-threatening.

“I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said in her petition. “I do not want to continue until my baby dies in my belly or I have to deliver a stillborn baby or one where life will be measured in hours or days.”"

(Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune via AP, File)

BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — A North Dakota judge ruled Tuesday that he won’t block a part of a state law that doctors say puts them at risk of prosecution if they perform an abortion to save a patient’s life or health.

State District Judge Bruce Romanick said the request for a preliminary injunction “is not appropriate and the Plaintiffs have presented no authority for the Court to grant the specific relief requested.” The lawsuit will continue to play out in court, with a jury trial set for August.

The request asked the judge to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of complications that could pose “a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

Physicians face “the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication,” attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh, of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in court arguments last month.

In a statement Tuesday, Mehdizadeh said, “Though we are disappointed by today’s decision, the court did not reach the constitutional questions at the heart of this case, and we remain confident that we will prevail after the court hears further evidence of how this law harms pregnant North Dakotans.”

North Dakota outlaws abortion except for cases in which women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

The judge said the plaintiffs appeared to request that he, “by way of a preliminary injunction, change application of the exception from ‘reasonable medical judgment’ to ‘good faith medical judgment.’ Plaintiffs have cited the Court with no legal authority that would allow the Court to re-write the statute in this manner under the pretense of providing injunctive relief.”

The state’s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who brought the 2023 bill revising revising the laws, welcomed the judge’s ruling.

“I think we have something that’s very clear for physicians to see,” she said. “I think it’s common sense what we put in as far as the health exceptions, and it goes with the intent of the legislators, so I applaud this judge for reading into it and realizing that the authority lies with us, as far as writing the law, and interpreting it simply shouldn’t be that hard for the physicians.”

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court’s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion.

The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect in 2022, a decision the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

Soon afterward, North Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state’s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed in April.

In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine.

Dec 28 2023,Woman who burned Wyoming’s abortion clinic ordered to pay,KSN TV,center,https://ksn.com/news/national-world/woman-who-burned-wyomings-abortion-clinic-ordered-to-pay,"CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — A judge has ordered a woman who set fire to Wyoming’s only full-service abortion clinic to pay nearly $300,000 in restitution, the full amount sought by prosecutors.

Lorna Green is serving five years in prison for burning Wellspring Health Access weeks before the clinic was set to open in Casper in 2022. The fire gutted the building while it was being renovated for the new clinic and delayed its opening by almost a year.

After opening this past April, Wellspring is now the only abortion clinic in Wyoming. A clinic in Jackson that provided pill abortions closed on Dec. 15 due to rising costs.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson ordered Green, 22, to pay about $298,000 in restitution including $240,000 to Nationwide General Insurance Company, the clinic’s insurer.

Green must also pay $33,500 to the building’s owner, Christine Lichtenfels, and $24,500 to Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access. Burkhart expressed satisfaction with the restitution.

“Not only did we have the emotional struggle and that trauma from the arson but also it was quite challenging for us financially. So I’m glad this is the final piece and it has been put to rest,” Burkhart said Wednesday.

The restitution was identical to the amounts sought by prosecutors and unopposed by Green’s attorney, Ryan Semerad, who in an emailed statement said Wednesday that Green “looks forward to a productive and peaceful life after her term of incarceration.”

Green has expressed remorse for the crime, which she said was driven by anxiety and nightmares about the planned clinic. The Casper College mechanical engineering student had shown no sign of anti-abortion views on social media but told investigators she opposed abortion.

She admitted driving from Laramie to Casper, breaking into the clinic through a door and lighting gasoline she poured in trays and splashed on the floor. After months of little progress, investigators increased the reward to $15,000 and got tips leading to Green’s arrest in March.

Green pleaded guilty in June to arson and in September received the minimum prison sentence. She had faced up to 20 years in prison.

The arson and eventual opening of the clinic happened as new laws in Wyoming seek to ban abortion in nearly all cases. The laws, including the nation’s first explicit ban on abortion pills, have been put on hold by a judge amid a lawsuit filed by four women and two nonprofits including Wellspring Health Access.

After hearing arguments in the lawsuit Dec. 14, Wyoming District Judge Melissa Owens is weighing whether to rule on the laws. Her decision would likely be appealed, putting Wyoming’s abortion laws before the state Supreme Court."

Jan 19 2024,Missouri abortion ballot effort raises more than $1 million in first day of launch,Missouri Independent,left,https://missouriindependent.com/2024/01/19/missouri-abortion-ballot-viabilty-effort-fundraises-1-million,"A campaign to legalize abortion in Missouri disclosed raising more than $1.1 million in donations on the first day it launched.

The campaign, a coalition organized under a political action committee called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, announced Thursday it was launching a campaign to move forward with a ballot initiative that would legalize abortion up until the point of fetal viability.

With the exception of medical emergencies, all abortions are illegal in Missouri.

The campaign has the support of Abortion Action Missouri, the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood affiliates in Kansas City and St. Louis.

Among the largest contributions include $100,000 from Abortion Action Missouri, $100,000 from the ACLU of Missouri, $75,000 from Planned Parenthood Great Plains and $30,000 from Access Missouri, according to reports filed to the Missouri Ethics Commission.

But the largest donation so far was a $500,000 check from the Fairness Project, a 501c4 nonprofit that does not have to disclose its donors. The organization helps bankroll ballot measures across the country, including Missouri’s successful 2020 Medicaid expansion initiative petition.

After months of internal debate, abortion-rights organizations settled on a proposed constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to “regulate the provision of abortion after fetal viability provided that under no circumstance shall the government deny, interfere with, delay or otherwise restrict an abortion that in the good faith judgment of a treating health care professional is needed to protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.”

While many say they see a clear path to victory for the amendment if it makes it to the ballot, the coalition still faces a tight timeline. The group estimates it will need to raise $5 million to successfully gather the more than 171,000 signatures needed by May 5 in order to appear on the statewide ballot.

“We are so proud to have launched this campaign with such a broad coalition and are excited to continue engaging Missourians in every corner of the state to come together and end Missouri’s abortion ban,” Mallory Schwarz, executive director of Abortion Action Missouri, said in a statement Thursday on behalf of the coalition.

A competing ballot campaign launched in November, led by longtime GOP Congressional staffer Jamie Corley, would enshrine abortion rights in the constitution up to 12 weeks of pregnancy and allow exceptions for rape and incest.

Corley on Thursday declined to give an update on her campaign status, but said having two initiatives on the ballot would be “less than ideal in terms of moving forward.”

“We all agree that the current abortion ban is too extreme and needs to change,” Corley said. “And we’ll keep assessing day by day what our role is in changing the abortion ban and making sure we restore access.”

Anti-abortion advocates lead new opposition campaign

The campaign to enshrine abortion rights up to fetal viability has been endorsed by numerous high-profile Democrats, including state Rep. Crystal Quade, who is running as a Democrat for governor on a platform that includes restoring abortion access.

“Since Missouri became the first state to enact a total abortion ban, women and families have suffered, doctors have fled the state, and our rights have been stripped away,” Quade wrote social media. “Sign the petition, gather signatures, and let’s return reproductive freedom to Missouri.”

While the major abortion advocacy organizations are lining up behind the measure, anti-abortion activists have launched their own campaign in opposition.

A political action committee, whose president is veteran anti-abortion activist Sam Lee, was formed last week to “push back against the Big Abortion Industry,” according to a news release. As of Thursday evening, the group had received a donation of just over $5,000, from the Missouri Catholic Conference and two $10,000 donations from the Missouri Senate Campaign Committee and the House Republican Campaign Committee.

The group, called Missouri Stands with Women, aims to fight any initiative petitions seeking to put abortion rights on the ballot, including the viability ban.

“When it really comes down to it, this measure is actually going to allow unregulated tax-payer funded abortions up to the moment of birth,” said Stephanie Bell, a spokeswoman for the committee. “Essentially what it’s saying is that as long as the individual has a health care professional that says the abortion is needed not only for the life of the mother, but for physical and mental health, that abortion will be available up until the moment of birth.”

“Our coalition is united and aligned, and we didn’t just come together yesterday,” Bell said. “We are prepared to educate voters and let them know what’s really in the initiative.”

Popularity of viability language in ballot initiatives

Erika Christensen, with Patient Forward, a group that advocates for abortion care later in pregnancy, said Thursday’s announcement to include a viability limit wasn’t surprising, considering many states have taken similar approaches since Roe was overturned, including Arizona, Florida, Nebraska and Nevada. Last fall, Ohioans voted to legalize abortion up to the point of viability.

“It will be better at getting people abortions,” Christensen said of the ballot measure. “It will hurt getting the government out of pregnancy.”

Viability can be difficult to define, she said, though it’s usually determined to be between 20 and 25 weeks gestation.

The Missouri petition defines fetal viability as the point in pregnancy when “there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’s sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.”

Christensen said while arguments are often made that a middle ground is needed to restore abortion access in states dominated by Republicans, those states are also where abortion advocates need to demand greater access.

“There’s still a lot of later abortion stigma in the reproductive-rights field,” Christensen said. “There are just different goals within the reproductive rights field, and I think we’re seeing that now finally play out after many years of arguments behind doors.”

Viability language has been criticized by some organizations, including members of the Missouri coalition like Planned Parenthood. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has dissuaded the use of viability limits in legislation, as there is no single clinical definition of viability.

Less than a year ago, Advocates of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region & Southwest Missouri published a letter titled “abortion restrictions under the guise of protections” that reads “viability standard tried and failed to balance state and personal interests, and it did not work.”

On Thursday, the same organization announced its support of the ballot initiative.

Veteran pro-abortion advocates want to eliminate bans

While the state’s major abortion-rights organizations support the initiative petition launched Thursday, criticism of the viability standard remains among veterans of Missouri’s reproductive health care movement.

Bonyen Lee-Gilmore, a spokesperson with the National Institute for Reproductive Health who previously worked for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said attempts to amend state constitutions are near-permanent, and should be treated with a higher standard.

“We as a movement have been talking the talk for decades, and now it’s time to walk the walk,” she said. “We can’t both say Roe is the floor only to permanently reinstate the floor.”

The coalition initially filed 11 different initiative petitions. Some versions sought to make abortion legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and one would have removed all gestational limits on abortion.

Schwarz, with Abortion Action Missouri, previously told The Independent that the coalition believes viability language meets most Missourians where they are.

“Many members of our coalition are out talking about abortion with Missourians every day, and we know that Missourians often have complex or nuanced positions on abortion, but there is one thing that they are aligned in, and it’s that they want to end the abortion ban,” Schwarz said. “That they do not support the abortion ban we are living under today, and we are confident this is our best path forward.”

Some see the language as a compromise not all abortion advocates are willing to make.

Robin Utz, who had an abortion in Missouri at 21 weeks when her unborn daughter was diagnosed with a fatal fetal condition, had hoped the coalition would choose a version without viability limits.

“Why we continue to let these people interfere with our healthcare is beyond me,” Utz said. “They‘ve shown us who they are, they act in bad faith, and I am a real-world consequence that is not theoretical or hypothetical.”

She added: “They are lacking imagination and courage to do the right thing.”

Pamela Merritt, who, like Utz, previously sat at the coalition table when abortion-rights groups were grappling with how to roll back abortion restrictions in Missouri, has long said she won’t support a petition that includes a fetal viability limit.

“I look forward to hearing the coalition articulate their strategy,” said Merritt, the executive director of Medical Students for Choice. “Not just through November of 2024, but for the next several years.”

Jan 03 2024,Gov. Sanders asks Biden administration to rescind Pentagon abortion policy,KTLO,center,https://ktlo.com/2024/01/03/gov-sanders-asks-biden-administration-to-rescind-pentagon-abortion-policy,"Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders asked the federal government Tuesday to rescind a Department of Defense policy regarding abortion that she said led an Arkansas Air National Guard leader to resign.

According to Arkansas Advocate, the Department of Defense reimburses members of the military for interstate travel related to abortion. In a letter to President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Sanders said Col. Dillon Patterson of the 188th Wing of the Arkansas Air National Guard resigned Dec. 18 due to religious objections to this policy, The Daily Caller first reported.

Sanders said Tuesday on X (formerly Twitter), “Even with Biden’s DoD falling far short of its recruitment goals, he’s chasing off qualified service members with his unconscionable abortion mandate. I’m calling on the President to put national security before far-left policy goals and stop punishing soldiers for their faith.”

According to the DOD website, “travel and transportation allowances may be authorized when access to non-covered reproductive health care services is not available within the local area” where a service member is stationed.

Sanders is not the first elected Republican to protest the Department of Defense’s abortion policies. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama spent months in 2023 blocking the promotions of several four-star military nominees, relenting in December after the Biden administration repeatedly declined to change its stance.

Roughly 80,000 active-duty female service members are stationed in states where legislatures enacted full or partial bans following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a RAND analysis.

Arkansas was one of several states in which abortion automatically became illegal, with a narrow exception to save the pregnant person’s life, due to an existing “trigger law” activated by the high court’s decision.

In Sanders’ letter to Biden and Lloyd, she called abortion “a barbaric practice” and the Department of Defense policy “irresponsible and shortsighted.” She noted that the Air National Guard fell short of its 2023 recruiting goals by 40%.

“Col. Patterson’s only fault was being a man of conviction led by senior Department of Defense leadership who had disregarded his service and abandoned his most fundamental constitutional rights in favor of more fashionable political and social experiments,” Sanders wrote.

Patterson took command of the 188th Wing in June, roughly four months after the Pentagon’s abortion policy was announced.

Dec 18 2023,Abortion amendment draws mixed support: SD poll,KOTA,center,https://kotatv.com/2023/12/18/abortion-amendment-draws-mixed-support-sd-poll,"The battle over a proposed 2024 ballot amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the South Dakota Constitution is not currently getting majority support from either side, according to a statewide poll sponsored by South Dakota News Watch.

The survey of 500 registered voters showed that 45.6% of respondents support the proposed measure, which would supersede a state abortion ban enacted when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. That’s more than the 43.6% who said they oppose the change, but it’s within the poll’s margin of error of 4.5%.

“It’s certainly competitive,” said Rick Weiland, former Democratic U.S. Senate candidate and executive director of Dakotans for Health, a grassroots organization gathering signatures to put the amendment on the November 2024 ballot.

“But I think once South Dakota voters understand that the trigger law they’re living under is one of the most extreme measures in the entire country, these numbers will grow exponentially.”

Rep. Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, who serves as vice president of South Dakota Right to Life and co-chair of the Sioux Falls-based Life Defense Fund, viewed the results as a positive for the anti-abortion movement.

He emphasized the fact that women surveyed in the poll oppose the measure 50.2% to 40.6%, with 9.2% undecided. A majority of men, 51%, said they support the proposed amendment; 36.9% oppose it and 12% are undecided.

“This poll makes clear that the majority of South Dakotans do not support the extreme abortion amendment, including the majority of women who have decided to oppose it,” Hansen said in an emailed statement to News Watch.

Opponents call abortion measure ‘extreme’

Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy conducted the survey Nov. 27-29. Those interviewed were selected randomly from a telephone-matched state voter registration list that included both land line and cellphone numbers. Respondents were representative of all South Dakota counties, ages, gender and political parties. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5%. South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota sponsored the poll.

The poll question summarized the amendment this way: “During the first trimester it would prevent the state from regulating abortions. During the second trimester, the state could regulate the abortion decision, but any regulation must be reasonably related to the physical health of the mother. During the third trimester, abortion could be prohibited except if it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman, according to her physician.”

Hansen has criticized the wording of the proposed amendment, saying it’s “far more extreme than Roe v. Wade itself.”

Weiland and others pushed back on that statement by saying the amendment uses the same trimester framework as Roe, the landmark 1973 ruling in which the Supreme Court held that the Constitution protected a woman’s right to an abortion prior to the viability of the fetus.

South Dakota under trigger law from 2005

South Dakota is currently under a 2005 state trigger law activated when the Supreme Court left it up to states to determine reproductive rights with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

The law makes it a Class 6 felony for anyone “who administers to any pregnant female or prescribes or procures for any pregnant female” a means for an abortion, except to save the life of the mother. South Dakota is one of 14 states whose abortion law does not include exceptions for rape and incest.

Some key takeaways from the News Watch poll:

Party lines: Democrats surveyed support the proposed amendment by a margin of 54.9% to 32.8%, with 12.3% undecided. Republicans oppose by a margin of 52.4% to 36.3%, with 11.3% undecided. For Independents/others, it was 54.6% support, 36.9% oppose, 8.5% undecided.

Age difference: The highest support of the proposed amendment (48.5%) came from the 65-plus age group, while the lowest (43.2%) came from the 50-64 age group. Support from other age groups was 47.6% from 18-34 year-olds and 45.3% from 35-49 year-olds.

Geographical splits: The most support of the proposed amendment came from East River/North (54.5%), followed by Sioux Falls Metro (46.7%), West River (41.3%) and East River/South (40.0%).

Putting abortion on the ballot

The proposed amendment reflects a national trend of progressive groups using the ballot initiative process to gain ground on abortion rights since the Supreme Court rolled back federal protections by overturning Roe v. Wade.

Election wins have come in conservative states such as Ohio, where 57% of voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2023 that ensured access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care.

Abortion poll News Watch region (South Dakota News Watch)

In Kansas, voters overwhelmingly rejected a 2022 constitutional amendment that would have allowed the Republican-led Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban abortion outright, with 59% voting against the amendment.

Petition efforts are also under way in states such as Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Nebraska to try to put the issue before voters in 2024, a presidential election year in which high turnout is expected.

News Watch abortion poll (South Dakota News Watch)

Dakotans for Health needs to collect a minimum of 35,017 signatures to place the abortion constitutional amendment on the South Dakota ballot. Weiland told News Watch that his group has collected “close to 50,000″ signatures as it pursues a goal of 60,000 or more to ensure that ballot access isn’t foiled by invalidated signatures or other technicalities. The deadline to submit signatures is May 7, 2024.

“First you have to make sure that you’ve got something to vote on, which is what we’ve been focused on,” said Weiland. “Then there’s a campaign to educate people in South Dakota about this issue. And we’ve already had conversations with tens of thousands of voters since we started actively circulating our petitions. You know, that’s 50,000 votes in the bank.”

Campaign ignites both sides

The petition drive has galvanized an equally passionate opposition movement, with anti-abortion groups wary of allowing the issue to reach the ballot. South Dakotans rejected near-total abortion bans by statewide vote in 2006 and 2008.

Life Defense Fund demonstrators, as part of their “Decline to Sign” campaign, have occasionally clashed with Dakotans for Health volunteers. Attorney General Marty Jackley sent a letter to Dakotas for Health on Oct. 31 saying that he had received “video and photographic evidence” purporting to show unattended petitions, a violation of state law, and people signing the same petition twice.

Weiland said his group trains petition circulators to follow state law and has addressed any irregularities. He said the larger issue is the harassment his volunteers have experienced at the hands of Life Defense Fund demonstrators.

Dakotans for Health successfully challenged a policy passed by the Minnehaha County Commission that imposed what a judge determined were unreasonable restrictions for petition circulators at the county administration building. A settlement was reached that removed references to a designated area for petition circulators and no longer required circulators to check in with the county auditor before engaging in political activity.

Hansen said his group is committed to campaigning against the measure because of the high-stakes nature of the abortion issue.

“Life Defense Fund works everyday to inform South Dakotans about the actual impacts of the abortion amendment, including legalizing late-term abortion and endangering women by banning safety regulations for most abortions,” Hansen told News Watch. “One thing is clear: the more people learn about the actual impacts of the extreme Abortion Amendment, the more they reject it.”

Poll in 2022: Increase abortion access

In July 2022, News Watch sponsored a Mason-Dixon poll that showed statewide support for making changes to South Dakota’s abortion laws.

That survey showed that a majority (57%) of respondents supported allowing legal access to abortion medications in the state.

More than three-fourths (76%) of those polled support allowing legal abortion in cases of rape and incest, an exception not currently allowed under South Dakota.

The poll also showed that nearly 8 in 10 respondents (79%) oppose criminal penalties for anyone who helps a South Dakota resident obtain an abortion where it is legal, such as in a neighboring state.

Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they supported having a statewide referendum to determine South Dakota’s laws regarding reproductive rights.

“We’re offering up something that the people of the United States and South Dakota had for 50 years and was taken away by the Supreme Court,” Weiland said. “When given a choice, we feel like people will overwhelmingly support freedom – more specifically, reproductive freedom in the context of Roe vs. Wade.”

""Idaho's interlocking abortion bans hinder and delay necessary obstetric care and make it nearly impossible for medical professionals to continue providing obstetric care in the state,"" reads the complaint, filed in September 2023. ""Pervasive fear and uncertainty throughout the medical community regarding the scope of the exceptions to abortion bans have put patients' lives and physicians' liberty at grave risk.""

The lawsuit, filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, argues that while abortions are technically permitted to ""prevent a pregnant woman's death,"" this description is unclear, leaving physicians unsure of when they can intervene.

Further, physicians who are found guilty of performing an abortion not covered under this exception face two to five years in prison, causing doctors to be hesitant to perform procedures that they believe are medically necessary out of fear of prosecution.

""Facing the threats of losing their medical licenses, thousands of dollars in fines, and up to five years in prison, it is no wonder that doctors and hospitals in Idaho are turning patients away—even women in medical emergencies,"" the complaint states. ""Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court for a declaratory judgment clarifying the scope of Idaho's Medical Exceptions, and granting any and all declaratory or injunctive relief necessary to protect the health and lives of pregnant people in Idaho.""

However, last month, the Idaho Attorney General's Office asked state Judge Jason Scott to dismiss the lawsuit in its entirety. Last week, Scott denied this request, allowing to suit to go forward. Scott did, however, dismiss two of the four claims against the state made in the complaint, including the claims that the law violates the Idaho Constitution's Equal Protection Clause and substantive due process provisions. Scott also dropped Idaho's governor, attorney general, and the Board of Medicine as defendants in the case.

Despite having some claims dismissed, supporters of the lawsuit expressed optimism that the suit has been allowed to go forward.

""We're grateful the court saw through the State's callous attempt to ignore the pain and suffering their laws are causing Idahoans. Now the State of Idaho will be forced to answer to these women in a court of law,"" said Gail Deady, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a Friday press release. ""In every state where abortion is banned, pregnant people are suffering."""
Jan 18 2024,Missouri abortion-rights campaign backs proposal to enshrine access but allow late-term restrictions,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/news/nation/abortion-Missouri-constitutional-amendment-viability-a73622,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — A Missouri abortion-rights campaign announced Thursday that it's throwing support behind an amendment to the state constitution that would enshrine access to the procedure while allowing restrictions in later stages of pregnancy.

Missourians for Constitutional Freedom said it is committing to a proposal, one of 11 versions, that would let lawmakers regulate or ban abortion after what's called viability, with an exception for the protection of the life and physical and mental health of the woman.

Supporters include the ACLU of Missouri, local Planned Parenthood affiliates and Abortion Action Missouri.

“Missouri’s cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care,” said Dr. Iman Alsaden, an adviser to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in a statement. “Today, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.”

The campaign faces steep opposition in its bid to get the proposal on November's ballot, with the petitions tied up in court for months after being challenged by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. Anti-abortion activities on Tuesday launched a campaign to quash any ballot initiative to amend the constitution aimed at bringing abortion back to the state.

The term is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. It’s generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy but has shifted earlier with medical advances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes viability language in legislation or regulations.

Executive Director Pamela Merritt in a statement said Medical Students for Choice “is deeply concerned by the trend of state coalitions organizing to enshrine restrictions on abortion access into state constitutions.”

“Codifying the most problematic components of Roe is a tactic that completely rejects the reproductive justice framework, placing greater importance on the rights of some while sacrificing abortion access for people most impacted by abortion bans,” Merritt said.

The decision by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom to include language on viability acknowledges concerns by some that a more expansive proposal would fail to pass in the state, which was among the first to outlaw almost all abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

It’s generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy but has shifted earlier with medical advances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposes viability language in legislation or regulations.

Executive Director Pamela Merritt in a statement said Medical Students for Choice “is deeply concerned by the trend of state coalitions organizing to enshrine restrictions on abortion access into state constitutions.”

“Codifying the most problematic components of Roe is a tactic that completely rejects the reproductive justice framework, placing greater importance on the rights of some while sacrificing abortion access for people most impacted by abortion bans,” Merritt said.

The decision by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom to include language on viability acknowledges concerns by some that a more expansive proposal would fail to pass in the state, which was among the first to outlaw almost all abortions after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. – A Missouri abortion-rights campaign announced Thursday that it's throwing support behind an amendment to the state constitution that would enshrine access to the procedure while allowing restrictions in later stages of pregnancy.

Missourians for Constitutional Freedom said it is committing to a proposal, one of 11 versions, that would let lawmakers regulate or ban abortion after what's called viability, with an exception for the protection of the life and physical and mental health of the woman.

“Missouri’s cruel and restrictive ban on abortion is tying the hands of doctors and preventing necessary care,” said Dr. Iman Alsaden, an adviser to Missourians for Constitutional Freedom and chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in a statement. “Today, Missourians are taking a critical step to make their own medical decisions and kick politicians out of the exam room.”

The campaign faces steep opposition in its bid to get the proposal on November's ballot, with the petitions tied up in court for months after being challenged by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft. Anti-abortion activities on Tuesday launched a campaign to quash any ballot initiative to amend the constitution aimed at bringing abortion back to the state.

Missourians for Constitutional Freedom has funding difficulties, ending 2023 with no money in the bank. Also complicating the effort is a competing ballot measure by a Republican that would allow abortion up to 12 weeks, and after that only in cases of rape, incest and in medical emergencies up until fetal viability.

Dec 16 2023,Ohio Supreme Court blocks state's abortion ban,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/ohio-supreme-court-blocks-abortion-ban,"The Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the state’s challenge to a judge’s order that has blocked the Buckeye State’s six-week abortion ban, which has been on hold for the past 14 months.

The ruling transfers the action in the case back to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, where abortion clinics this week asked Judge Christian Jenkins to strike down the law in the wake of the passage of the state’s abortion rights amendment.

APPLESAUCE POUCHES MAY HAVE INTENTIONALLY BEEN POISONED WITH LEAD:Â FDA

The state Supreme Court on Friday said the appeal was dismissed because of “a change in the law,” referencing the constitutional amendment protecting reproductive rights.

The law was signed by Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) in 2019 and prohibited most abortions after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, typically observable via ultrasound by six weeks gestation.

The controversial measure briefly went into effect after the United States Supreme Court overturned federal constitutional protections for abortion rights in 2022 with the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling. The law, however, was quickly blocked by a county judge.

In March, the justices agreed to review the county judge’s order that blocked the enforcement of the so-called heartbeat bill and to consider whether clinicians had standing to challenge the law. On Friday, the high court denied Attorney General Dave Yost’s request to launch an independent review of the constitutional right to abortion.

Abortion providers in the state asked the lower court that originally thwarted the ban to permanently strike it down, citing Yost’s legal analysis that the state’s abortion rights amendment would invalidate the six-week ban on abortion.

The heartbeat bill motivated many Ohioans to vote in favor of the sweeping abortion rights amendment that gives physicians and women the power to terminate a pregnancy after viability if deemed appropriate by a woman’s medical care provider.

Abortion rights advocates say that the amendment far supersedes the status quo prior to 2022 under the Roe v. Wade legal framework."
Nov 09 2023,"Virginia, Ohio elections and abortion",Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/8/virginia-ohio-elections-and-abortion/,"OPINION:

Elections, especially in Virginia and Ohio, should convince pro-life Republicans of their need to come up with a different strategy when it comes to abortion. A no-exceptions mandate, or strictly limiting the procedure, isn’t working, partly because a new generation of younger people seems less predisposed to curtailing it.

Instead of being put on the defensive for pregnancies due to rape, incest, or the life of the mother, Republicans and pro-lifers need to go on the offensive. USA Today has reported that according to the Guttmacher Institute, “Just one percent of women obtain an abortion because they became pregnant through rape, and less than 0.5% do so because of incest.”

Those who are pro-life need to do a better job of portraying the other side as the real radicals. They mostly oppose any restrictions on abortion. Pro-lifers should continue to work to protect the lives of the unborn at earlier stages. Aren’t more than 60 million U.S. abortions since 1973 enough? Are people not concerned about the decline in America’s birthrate?

Back to politics. In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has been seen by some as a possible alternative to Donald Trump in the presidential contest, had campaigned hard to hold on to the slim Republican majority in the state House of Delegates and flip the Democrats’ slim majority in the state Senate. He and Republicans lost both houses, dooming most of his agenda for his last two years in office, as well as his proposal to limit abortions to 15 weeks.

Redistricting in Virginia did not help Mr. Youngkin’s cause. On top of the usual large turnout by Democrats in Northern Virginia, Richmond and other high-population cities, the redrawing of district lines favored Democrats. It’s fair to say that any hope of a Youngkin presidential candidacy next year is dead, if it ever was alive, because he eschewed any talk of running until the election was over. It’s now over, and with filing deadlines rapidly approaching in some states, it appears over for him in 2024.

There are calls from some for Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to resign because of continuing GOP losses, but she is not the main problem. Too many Republicans are reluctant to talk about abortion because they appear unsure or uncomfortable with their positions.

The other side is anything but uncomfortable. They are deeply committed to fighting for “a woman’s right to choose,” and their convictions appear to be overwhelming the pro-life position.

We live in an anti-life and increasingly lawless culture. When I was young, newspapers buried most crime stories on inside pages because there was so little of it. The rare murder made it to the front page and was the lead story on local TV. Today, even when there are multiple murders in big cities, they barely get our attention, because we have become so inured to violence.

I see abortion increasingly as a reflection of our deepening decadence at many levels. It’s not the main cause of our moral decline. That means it must be dealt with at a deeper level than politics.

As expected, Democrats are celebrating their victories. It appears they will make abortion a central issue in the 2024 presidential campaign. Perhaps Republicans should keep the focus not on abortion but rather on President Biden’s sagging poll numbers.

Dec 16 2023,Ohio High Court Dismisses Abortion Ban Case,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/abortion-ban-ohio/2023/12/16/id/1146190,"The Ohio Supreme Court has dismissed the state’s challenge to a judge’s order that has blocked enforcement of Ohio's near-ban on abortions for the past 14 months.

The ruling moves action in the case back to Hamilton County Common Pleas, where abortion clinics asked Judge Christian Jenkins this week to throw out the law following voters' decision to approve enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution.

The high court on Friday said the appeal was “ dismissed due to a change in the law.”

The justices in March agreed to review a county judge’s order that blocked enforcement of the abortion restriction and to consider whether clinics had legal standing to challenge the law. They ultimately denied Republican Attorney General Dave Yost’s request that they launch their own review of the constitutional right to abortion, leaving such arguments for a lower court.

The clinics asked Jenkins on Thursday to block the abortion ban permanently on the heels of the amendment Ohio voters approved last month that ensures access to abortion and other reproductive health care.

A law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibited most abortions after the first detectable “fetal heartbeat.” Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.

The ban, initially blocked through a federal legal challenge, briefly went into effect when the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned last year. It was then placed back on hold in county court, as part of a subsequent lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional under the state constitution.

Yost's office referred to a statement from Dec. 7 that “the state is prepared to acknowledge the will of the people on the issue, but also to carefully review each part of the law for an orderly resolution of the case.”

The abortion providers asked the lower court that initially blocked the ban to permanently strike it down. They cited Yost’s own legal analysis, circulated before the vote, that stated that passage of the amendment would invalidate the state’s six-week ban, stating, “Ohio would no longer have the ability to limit abortions at any time before a fetus is viable.”"

A day before his term was set to end, Trump issued an order to preemptively declassify most of the binder’s contents well before it was ready and regardless of some of the redactions. Multiple copies of the redacted version had been created inside the White House, with plans to hand them off to Republicans and right-wing journalists. But that’s not what happened.

Today’s Supreme Court order allows Idaho’s extreme abortion ban to go back into effect and denies women critical emergency abortion care required by federal law. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has enabled Republican elected officials to pursue dangerous abortion bans like this one that continue to jeopardize women’s health, force them to travel out of state for care, and make it harder for doctors to provide care, including in an emergency. These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America.

The Vice President and I believe that healthcare decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law. As this case continues, the stakes could not be higher for women across America. Congress must immediately restore the protections of Roe v. Wade so that women in every state can access the health care they need."

PIERCE COUNTY, Wash. — Warning: This story describes details about an alleged sexual assault.

A married nurse practitioner is accused of forcing abortion pills inside his girlfriend, who was also one of his patients, after she got pregnant.

David Benjamin Coots is charged with assault in the second degree, rape in the third degree, witness tampering and five violations of court orders. Coots practiced at a MultiCare Tacoma location in Gig Harbor, although his profile no longer appears on the company's website.

According to court documents, the victim was a patient of Coots who had entered into an intimate relationship with him in January 2023. The woman told police that when she learned Coots was married, he told her he was in the process of separating from his wife.

The woman told police that she had learned she was pregnant in January 2024, and that Coots was ""overly supportive"" when she informed him. However, she says that about a week later when they were having sex, he ""put his fingers so far inside of her that it felt 'uncomfortable,' the woman told police.

She later found a pill on toilet paper she used after going to the bathroom, and subsequently found a second pill and ""some kind of foil"" when she checked further inside herself.

Coots told her the pills were Misoprostol or Cytotec, ""which are used to cause miscarriages."" She said he had told her he had prescribed the pills to himself. The woman told police that Coots apologized and asked her how much money she wanted to not report the information to police.

The woman also was contacted by Coots' wife, Melissa, who texted and later showed up at her house to ask how much money she wanted to not go to the police, court documents say. The woman says she and her daughter moved into a nearby hotel in fear knowing that Coots' wife knew where she lived and had been at her house.

After the woman got a restraining order, Coots continued to try and contact her and even showed up at her brother's house with flowers and gifts at one point, per court documents. He also wrote the woman a letter that was typed single-spaced and over seven pages to ""express his love and his remorse.""

Melissa Coots is also charged with witness tampering in the case. MultiCare released a statement to KING 5 in response to the charges, which read:

""MultiCare has no higher priority than the safety of our patients. We take these allegations of inappropriate behavior by our provider very seriously and are conducting a thorough investigation. The provider in question no longer works for Multicare."""

Harris's office has declined to say what clinic or times she would speak for safety purposes but confirmed she would tour the location during normal hours and talk with staff about how the state has been impacted by abortion bans in neighboring states following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade in 2022.

She is also expected to take place speak at a rally in the Minneapolis-St. Paul's area.

The facility also offers services for birth control and preventative wellness care but Harris' office said her the visit would mark the first time an active president or vice president had visited a clinic that provides abortions.

During the visit, Harris is expected to lay out the Biden administration's for reproductive rights in the wake of the Supreme Court decision.

The Minneapolis stop is the sixth on Harris' ""Fight for Reproductive Freedom"" tour where the administration tries to galvanize support around abortion rights.

At many of the events Harris takes part in, she often shares personal stories of women and how they have been affected since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. She has stressed how new laws in states led by conservatives have criminalized doctors and forced women to travel out of state for their care."
Mar 08 2024,France’s Abortion Move Is Characteristic—and a Warning to the U.S.,The American Conservative,right,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/frances-abortion-move-is-characteristic-and-a-warning-to-the-u-s/,"On International Women’s Day, it is the tradition of modern women to grumble about men. Permit me to join them: My grievance is with the majority male French Parliament, which on Monday voted overwhelmingly to enshrine a right to abortion in the French constitution.

France’s move is mostly symbolic: The country prides itself on being ahead of the curve of liberal democracy, meaning the legal freedom to kill the unborn is unlikely to be curtailed in French law regardless of what the constitution says. But after the United States Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, France’s President Emmanuel Macron promised to provide constitutional protection for infanticide too. The French parliament kept that promise Monday afternoon, making it the first nation to create a right to abortion in its foundational document. The streets of Paris ran purple with women and men celebrating their freedom to kill.

The streets of Paris, of course, are used to this kind of scene. It has not been many years since 1789 that they have not been filled with some manner of demonstration in the name of liberation: To list even the names of these frequent protests would be an essay in itself. The French people’s demand for freedom, stretching back to the Revolution era cry for liberté, has resulted in a lot of dead brothers, born and unborn.

For those Americans watching, this is not just political theater. France moved to make abortion sovereign this week precisely because the United States Supreme Court has said that it is not, at least not according to the U.S. Constitution as currently written. This is the contagious nature of rebellions which so concerned the American founders. Considering their own revolt would inspire the events leading to the Reign of Terror in France, which in turn spurred the 13-year bloodbath in Saint-Domingue, as Haitian slaves overthrew their French colonial masters, it was a reasonable concern.

But perhaps it is the particular nature of France to be cataclysmic. It is there that the egalitarian ideals of the Enlightenment have their origin and most poignant picture, and many of the same ideals are responsible for our current inverted mores on the question of infanticide. Revolutionary France saw the “rights of men” through the lens of immediacy—the rights of these men, often paid for with the lives of others—in a sense the American colonists, with their concern for posterity, did not. Similarly, the rights of women today have been underwritten by the blood sacrifice of the unborn. Of all the nations to make abortion a constitutional right first, it is not surprising that it was France.

While the Enlightenment heavily influenced our own nation’s founding, at least one French observer noticed the early Americans’ character was a happy antidote to many of democracy’s ills. As late as the 1830s, Alexis de Tocqueville described men and women still interacting under what Scott Yenor recently termed a “soft patriarchy,” either out of habit or preference, despite several decades under a democratic regime. Revolutionary France, meanwhile, downgraded the penalty for abortion and granted women immunity for the crime almost immediately—a small but significant shift at a time when the punishment for abortion was still commonly death. A simple comparison of the American and French Revolutions illustrates the wide difference between the two peoples in the 18th century, which persisted at least into the 19th.

That difference has shrunk substantially in the last century. Our soft patriarchy has given way to a near total gynocracy, as the modern American republic attempts to realize the French ideal of interchangeable men and women. Essential to this change, of course, is the removal of the burden of childbearing, which naturally falls asymmetrically on women.

Also essential is the use of democratic tactics to do so. Outsourcing law from the legislator, who in theory spends his day contemplating the best forms of government, to a popular vote, where voters might think for a few hours at most before deciding, will almost always have the effect of creating worse legislation. There are few differences between legislators and voters today anyhow, but that just proves the point: The age-old anxiety that the tendency of democracy is away from thoughtful and intelligent discourse and toward demagoguery.

Under this interpretation, the American abortion mob has ruled through ballot measures. Since June 2022, six states have voted to amend their constitutions regarding abortion. In every case, from California to Ohio, the side of the proposal favoring decreased regulation of abortion won. Seeing these victories, another 13 states, including Republican bastions like Florida and South Dakota, will attempt to do the same before the year is out. The same results now seem practically guaranteed in every state where the constitution may be amended by ballot proposal. As Ohio showed, attempting to revoke direct democracy after an abortion proposal has made it onto the ballot just makes you lose harder. The slope is, in fact, slippery.

Only a handful of states like Tennessee, which grants the privilege of constitutional amendment only to elected representatives, are immune to such challenges going forward. That is, only those states in which republican elements are favored over direct democracy may stop the bleeding."
Mar 04 2024,The anti-abortion playbook for restricting birth control,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/24087411/anti-abortion-roe-dobbs-birth-control-contraception-ivf,"The national debate over IVF, unfolding after an Alabama court decision prompted multiple clinics in the state to halt operations, prompts a question: What might be next? Could other fertility treatments and even birth control be under threat given that Roe v. Wade is no longer the law?

If the idea that birth control could be at risk in America strikes you as hard to believe, I understand. There’s no proposed legislation on the table to ban it, and it does seem unbelievable that contraception — which an overwhelming majority of US women, including religious and Republican women, have used and support — could one day disappear.

But attacks on reproductive rights have never really been about public opinion, as the overturn of Roe showed and the current national debate over IVF has further proved. While it’s not an immediate threat, anti-abortion leaders have been laying the groundwork to curtail contraception access for many decades, despite birth control being one of the most reliable ways to reduce the incidence of abortion.

Their fundamental opposition is rooted in a belief that penetrative sex is sacred and should only occur within a heterosexual marriage and in the service of having children. In their eyes, birth control has encouraged sex outside of marriage — a development they charge with weakening families, absolving men of responsibility, and steering women away from domestic duties.

These are fringe conservative views, but ones endorsed by religious institutions and groups that have long provided funding and power to the anti-abortion movement.

“I think contraception is disgusting, people using each other for pleasure,” said Joseph Scheidler, the late founder of the Pro-Life Action League, an activist group that pioneered confrontational tactics like sit-ins at abortion clinics and picketing outside doctors’ homes. The New York Times described Scheidler as the “godfather” of the movement.

Randall Terry, who founded the group Operation Rescue — known for blockading and protesting abortion clinics and patients — once laid out the logic against birth control plainly: “Any drug or device that prevents us from having children” is “anti-child,” he said. “How do we expect to defeat child-killing in the world when we cannot defeat child-rejection in our own midst?”

The political playbook for attacking birth control shares some similarities with the playbook for attacking abortion — a slow and steady chipping away of rights and access. Both efforts rely on measures like slashing funding for low-income patients, enacting parental consent laws to restrict minors’ use, and empowering ideologically supportive lawmakers and judges who push friendly legal frameworks.

But the major difference between pushing to restrict abortion access and pushing to restrict birth control is that leaders are typically much quieter about their goals for the latter, aware that open discussion will prompt fierce backlash. They typically try to paint those who suggest they’d take aim at contraception as alarmists and conspiracists.

When Democrats in Congress introduced a bill to codify access to birth control following the overturn of Roe, for example, they were met with emphatic performances of exasperation.

“This bill is completely unnecessary. In no way, shape, or form is access to contraception limited or at risk of being limited,” declared Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack during debate on the House floor. “The liberal majority is clearly trying to stoke fears and mislead the American people.”

Still, a growing number of Republican lawmakers — including Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Mike Braun — have recently declared that Griswold v. Connecticut, the 1965 Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to birth control, was wrongly decided. Griswold relies on the same legal right to privacy that underpinned Roe, and in his concurring Dobbs v. Jackson opinion in 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas encouraged the Supreme Court to “reconsider” Griswold and other privacy-related decisions. Former Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters went so far as to pledge to “vote only for federal judges who understand that Roe and Griswold” should be overturned.

Leaders more than occasionally reveal their underlying beliefs. Recent statements, as well as recent actions from reproductive rights opponents, have sent clear reminders about how some influential activists really think about contraception: that it’s just another form of abortion.

Activists aim to blur the line between birth control and abortion

Anti-abortion leaders tend to take advantage of one basic fact about the American people: There is great confusion about how pregnancy works, how abortion pills end it, and how birth control and emergency contraception (such as Plan B) prevent it. For example, one recent poll found that a stunning 73 percent of Americans think emergency contraception can end a pregnancy.

But among most medical experts, including those at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — there is no confusion. Birth control, including emergency contraception, prevents ovulation (when an egg is released) and fertilization (when egg and sperm meet). Pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterine wall, a process called implantation. Many fertilized eggs never implant.

Yet for a highly motivated wing of the anti-abortion movement, pregnancy starts not at implantation but at conception, and human personhood begins then too, not at birth. These “fetal personhood” activists want to endow fetuses, embryos, and fertilized eggs with full rights and legal protections and thus frame any effort to prevent implantation — be it through discarding embryos from IVF or taking a daily birth control pill — as a form of killing unborn children.

It’s a stretch of scientific consensus, but certain Christian activists have long clung to this idea and have slowly been codifying it in state law through bills that claim human life begins at conception. More than a third of states currently have such laws on the books.

To blur the line between abortion and contraception, many of these activists call birth control methods “abortifacients” — agents that induce abortion. But this is misleading because there’s no pregnancy to abort. Real abortifacients are the medications that end pregnancies, namely misoprostol and mifepristone.

In rationalizing the idea that birth control can somehow abort a pregnancy before a pregnancy begins, activists make a number of claims. Human Life International, a global Catholic group, maintains that anything that prevents implantation is an abortion-inducing agent. IUDs, they insist, cause “early abortions.” Students for Life of America likewise claims all forms of hormonal birth control, including IUDs and the Pill, are abortifacients.

Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene went so far as to proclaim that Plan B emergency contraception “kills a baby in the womb once a woman is already pregnant” even though studies have shown the drug interferes with ovulation but does not inhibit implantation.

Greene isn’t the only Republican lawmaker blurring the lines. Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert tried to block funds for “abortifacient contraceptive drugs,” while Montana Rep. Matt Rosendale tried adding emergency contraception to a bill barring use of the federal funding for abortion. In 2022, in perhaps one of the most glaring examples, Missouri Republicans pushed unsuccessfully to restrict public funding for IUDs and emergency contraception, with one of the state senators who led it proclaiming that “life begins at conception,” and “anything that destroys that life is abortion, it’s not birth control.”

Just this past week in Iowa, House Republicans attempted to amend a bipartisan bill to legalize over-the-counter birth control by adding new language that would require pharmacists to provide misleading and inaccurate information implying contraceptives are dangerous and a form of abortion. Pulse Life Advocates, an Iowa group opposing the contraception bill, claims on its website that birth control “kills babies.”

Many of these objections will sound familiar to anyone who followed the fight around the Affordable Care Act 15 years ago. The political groundwork was laid in 2010 when the Tea Party movement came into power and fought alongside the Catholic Church against requirements that employer health insurance plans cover birth control. And in 2014, the retail chain Hobby Lobby won its case before the US Supreme Court in which it argued it shouldn’t have to provide employees with IUDs or emergency contraception since its ownership viewed such things as abortion.

Wellness influencers have joined anti-abortion activists in raising fears about birth control

While many “fetal personhood” activists have long opposed birth control for religious reasons, over the last decade they’ve found new allies among secular “wellness” influencers who propagate dubious ideas online about vaccines, nutrition, and environmental toxins.

Many of these online influencers promote the idea of “natural” products and in the last few years have added hormonal birth control to their list of substances they claim people should avoid to live a healthy life.

Seizing on general distrust of medical institutions and the fact that some users do experience adverse side effects when using birth control, these influencers have insisted that hormonal contraceptives will likely lead to weight gain, to a diminished sex drive, and to emotional disorders. These warnings often go well beyond the scientific evidence and pair neatly with the exaggerated warnings anti-abortion groups spread about contraception, like that it will cause infertility, strokes, and cancer.

Alex Clark, a popular conservative online influencer, has told her young, female audience that she’s “on a mission to get young women off this pill.” Politico reported that Clark claimed hormonal birth control “is completely altering your personality” and insisted that many forms of birth control “are actually abortifacients.”

This fusion of feminine “wellness” content and anti-abortion advocacy can also be seen in the growth of Evie Magazine, an ostensibly nonsectarian outlet targeting young women that publishes stories like “13 Reasons Why You Should Quit Hormonal Birth Control” and “Abortion Is an Anti-Woman Issue That Has Nothing to Do with Bodily Autonomy or Reproductive Freedom.” Evie also promotes a venture-backed startup that encourages controlling fertility through “natural” means.

These tactics seem to be having an effect. One poll published in June 2023 found more than half of the roughly 4,000 women surveyed expressed fears about how hormonal birth control would affect their physical and mental health. An Instagram poll by theSkimm, a media company that focuses on Gen Z and millennial women, found that a third of respondents who weren’t on birth control had stopped taking it in the past year.

Meanwhile a study published recently in Health Affairs found statistically significant evidence that barriers to birth control had increased and “reports of receiving high-quality contraceptive care” had decreased since Roe was overturned.

“Fetal personhood” activists struggle to maintain the fiction they are neutral on birth control

When asked about their intentions to restrict or protect access to birth control, Republican lawmakers and leaders of the anti-abortion movement will typically point out the fact that there’s no bill currently under consideration explicitly aimed at banning contraception.

As journalist Jessica Valenti noted in her Abortion, Every Day newsletter, the president of Ohio Right to Life mocked a state Democrat who warned of the risk to birth control by saying, “she can’t cite a piece of legislation that bans contraception … it’s fear-mongering.” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America’s website calls it a “MYTH” that Republicans want to stop people from getting birth control. “FACT: No state anywhere has banned birth control,” it says.

And yet taking one big swing to restrict access has never been the strategy of the anti-contraception playbook. Rather, activists either maintain neutrality on birth control or say nothing while actively working to conflate abortion with birth control and pass laws that redefine life as beginning at conception.

As journalist Christina Cauterucci pointed out at Slate, the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life claims on its website that it takes “no stance on the underlying issue of contraceptive use,” but elsewhere it insists that people who use emergency contraception “take the lives of their unborn children.” When Mother Jones reporter Kiera Butler attended the annual conference of the anti-abortion group Heartbeat International in 2022, she found restriction of birth control to be a major theme, with several sessions dedicated to the topic.

The push to redefine the start of personhood as the point of conception holds real implications for fertility treatments and the wide range of available birth control methods. Many lawmakers in states with such “fetal personhood” laws on the books have not fully grappled with the practical consequences of how enforcing those laws in the post-Roe era might work.

In the near future, most Republicans will likely continue to dismiss the idea that there’s any threat to birth control at all, and leaders of anti-abortion organizations will surely do their best to change the subject.

But pay attention to how fights over expanding access to birth control — including nonhormonal methods like condoms — play out. Pay attention to proposals to gut funding for Title X, a federal program that provides birth control to millions of low-income people in the United States. Pay attention to efforts in Congress to restrict access to contraception in foreign aid spending bills. And pay attention to how courts and lawmakers aim to expand the definition of abortion."

Mar 15 2024,Arkansas could become the latest conservative state to put abortion before voters,Southwest Times Record,not-yet-rated,https://swtimes.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/15/arkansas-abortion-amendment-activists-campaign-for-signatures/72959689007,"Arkansas is one of 20 states that have severely restricted or completely outlawed abortion in the nearly two years since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Some anti-abortion groups consider the state's law one of the most restrictive in the nation.

But now, an effort is underway to change that and give Arkansas voters a chance to enshrine some abortion protections into the state Constitution. If the effort is successful, Arkansas could join a small number of other conservative states to put the issue before voters.

Activists are using a ballot measure to push for a change that has proven out of reach in the General Assembly.

The citizen-initiated constitutional amendment would legalize abortion through 18 weeks of pregnancy and in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and risk to the life or health of the mother.

Unlike many other Southern states, “Arkansas' constitution is objectively among the easier to amend of all the state constitutions, because we have this direct democracy route,” said Janine Parry, a University of Arkansas political science professor.

Gennie Diaz is the leader of Arkansas for Limited Government, the group working to get the item on the November ballot.

She said that before the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, and the dramatic upwelling of public support for abortion rights that came with it, this would have been virtually impossible.

“We could not have done it in our state pre-Dobbs,"" she said, referring to the court case that led to Roe's fall.

But in this unprecedented political moment, her group, Arkansans for Limited Government, which held a rally on Sunday at the state Capitol, is gaining traction for their amendment.

They're forging ahead to certify their measure and put it directly to the voting public.

A national trend

Arkansas' amendment is one of 12 potential ballot issues across the country seeking to protect or expand access to reproductive care in November. An additional five aim to restrict abortion.

These questions over whether to cement abortion rights will be the first since last year in Ohio, another red state, where a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortion passed 56.6% to 43.4%.

According to polling data from the Pew Research Center, Arkansas is among the top three most conservative states attempting to bring any kind of abortion-related item to the ballot this cycle, alongside Montana and South Dakota.

The people out collecting the 91,000 required signatures for the Arkansas amendment are all volunteers. Diaz said they’ve trained around 350 so far. They’ve mostly been collecting signatures through online outreach and by canvassing in public places, including in and outside of businesses that allow them to.

They haven’t been going door to door so far, partly because, especially in rural areas, the distances make it inefficient. They’re also looking to avoid any possibility of confrontation with people opposed to their legislation.

If and when they get the signatures they need, the next step is submitting them to the state. “Every signature is scrutinized,” Diaz said, and checked against each person’s address and voter registration status.

If enough are rejected that the number of signatures falls below the threshold to be on the ballot, there’s a period when groups can “cure” them — or correct any mistakes that might have led to them being disqualified.

Two groups in the state, Arkansas Right to Life and the Family Council, have mounted “decline to sign” campaigns against the abortion amendment. But Diaz said only five state lawmakers have taken a vocal stand against them.

'Not a political statement'

Diaz and Arkansans for Limited Government have lowered their sights from what they see as an ideal amendment in the interest of giving it a better chance at passing.

“This policy that we're proposing is not a political statement on abortion,” Diaz said. “We're not saying, ‘Hey, the government cannot restrict abortion in any circumstance because a woman has an inherent right to choose.’”

“We believe that,” Diaz said, “but that is not policy that, from a pragmatic standpoint, will pass in Arkansas.”

The amendment would legalize abortion in some cases and provide certain exceptions.

Parry, the political science professor, characterized the amendment as relatively moderate. “They're not shooting the moon here by any stretch,” she said. “They did some polling in advanced as I understand, and they decided to keep it in the really early months of pregnancy.”

Based on polling conducted by the university’s Arkansas Poll, which she directs, Parry believes the amendment will pass if it reaches the ballot.

Over the last few years, support for the abortion ban currently on the books in Arkansas, which has exceptions only for medical emergencies, has polled at between 15% and 20%.

Politically, she said she sees “even higher stakes for those who oppose” the abortion amendment than for those advocating for it.

Many of the amendment’s provisions see broad support — even “supermajorities,” she said — for protections for abortion in cases of fetal malformations and the health of the mother, for instance.

“We have that burden of convincing the majority of Arkansans that they are the majority,” Diaz said. “I think that there's this fear that they're alone in having a nuanced view, when they're not.”

The amendment does not include exceptions for things like financial hardship, which Parry said do not have majority support. “They were sensitive to some of the nuance of public opinion when they wrote it,” she said.

County by county

For each type of issue — initiative, amendment or referendum — to be get on the ballot, it has to get the signatures of a certain percentage of the last gubernatorial election’s turnout. Canvassers are required to collect that percentage statewide but also across each of a required number of counties.

Act 236, which passed last year, is one of the major new changes to the process. It mandates that the signatures must come from across 50 of the state's 75 counties, rather than the 15 stipulated in the state constitution.

This will make it so groups looking to advance a ballot item can’t rely as heavily on dense population centers and will have to go farther afield into more sparsely populated, and often more conservative, rural areas.

The law’s constitutionality is currently at the center of a court challenge brought by the League of Women Voters of Arkansas, which supports an initiative which would eliminate state sales tax on menstrual products and diapers. Their co-plaintiff is Republican state Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, who said he stands behind another new initiative the hopes to see on the ballot in November, which would protect and strengthen the state’s Freedom of Information Act.

Parry said that Act 236 is intended to raise the bar for entry to put a measure on the ballot but has “increased the determination of people who want to circulate these signatures to get it right.”

It’s possible it will be struck down, and the required number of counties will revert to 15. “We won’t take the risk,” though, Diaz said. Arkansans for Limited Government is collecting as many as possible, just to be safe, and already has signatures from 65 counties.

Diaz is relatively upbeat about having to add 35 counties to her organizational map, though she maintains that Act 236 is unconstitutional.

She says it forces their hand to “build more organizing power in areas where we typically don’t have to concentrate.” It’s extra work, but “it’s doable.”

“I look at it as opportunity, because we need to be talking to Arkansans about this issue,” she said. “It needs to be done even if we weren't trying to get something on the ballot.”

Her campaign is working with Healthcare Alliance for Reproductive Care, a group of doctors, nurses, hospital administrators and other providers who do outreach among their peers, counseling them on how to participate in supporting the amendment.

“We have a really high burden and a high responsibility to educate Arkansans in general about reproductive health,” she said, noting that Arkansas has no mandatory sex education in school.

Katie Clark, a League of Women Voters of Arkansas board member who is a leader of an initiative campaign but not directly involved in the lawsuit, said that if it’s done right, even a failed ballot item can be worth it for the exposure and public education.

A strong and conspicuous display of public support could even “effect change in future legislative sessions,"" she said."

Mar 14 2024,GOP Candidate For Governor Commits Embarrassing Mix-Up While Attacking Abortion,Bipartisan Report,not-yet-rated,https://bipartisanreport.com/2024/03/14/gop-candidate-for-governor-commits-embarrassing-mix-up-while-attacking-abortion,"A Republican candidate for governor in Missouri profoundly mixed up the basics of his argument in a recent attempt at complaining about support for reproductive health care, particularly abortion.

Bill Eigel, who is currently a state Senator in Missouri, was responding to reports that a recent concert in the state featuring singer Olivia Rodrigo saw the distribution of “Plan B” to attendees. The medication, a form of birth control, is not abortion. (Prescription drugs that do produce an abortion are tightly controlled by the federal government and the subject of recent legal disputes that reached the U.S. Supreme Court!) But abortion is where Eigel went with his angry response — which he’d be more equipped to turn into some real-world policy response if he is ever elected governor.

“As the father of a daughter, I am horrified by this. Olivia Rodrigo passed out an abortifacient at her concert in St. Louis last night,” Eigel wrote online. “This was sponsored by the “Missouri Abortion Fund.” Many of her fans are CHILDREN. Abortion hurts women. Physical damage of course, but also psychological. Women who have had abortions have higher rates of anxiety, mental health problems, substance abuse, and suicide. @oliviarodrigo is actively harming women in Missouri by championing abortion. She should be ashamed.”

Eigel’s fear-mongering around abortion aside, he is, again, getting the basics mixed up here. RXList — a medical reference source available online to brief Googling! — defines Plan B thusly: “Plan B: Brand name for a progestin-only emergency contraceptive designed to prevent pregnancy within 72 hours after a contraceptive accident or unprotected sex. […] It is not an abortifacient.”

And these are the people who want to be in charge of making decisions about access to reproductive health care? The ones getting basic facts about it — made evident by ample resources accessible via search — wrong? Completely and unequivocally incorrect? Eigel’s campaign, meanwhile, is still in the primary stage. Missouri will hold its primaries in which it’ll finalize a Republican pick for governor in August."
Mar 14 2024,The Hyde Amendment and Coverage for Abortion Services Under Medicaid in the Post-Roe Era,Kaiser Family Foundation,center,https://kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/the-hyde-amendment-and-coverage-for-abortion-services-under-medicaid-in-the-post-roe-era,"Key Takeaways

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for terminating pregnancies that endanger the life of the pregnant person or that result from rape or incest.

Among the 36 states that do not ban abortion, 19 states and DC follow the Hyde Amendment and 17 states use state funds to pay for abortions for women with low incomes insured by Medicaid beyond the Hyde limitations.

Today, 35% (5.5 million) of women ages 15 to 49 covered by Medicaid live in states where abortion remains legal, but the program will not cover the service except for limited Hyde circumstances. Twenty-one percent live in a state where abortion is banned.

Medicaid is a significant source of health coverage for women who have higher rates of abortion in the U.S. including women with low incomes, and women of color.

The overturning of Roe v. Wade has limited abortion access in large swaths of the United States, but for many individuals, especially those with Medicaid coverage, access to abortion services was limited prior to the Dobbs decision. Starting in 1977, the Hyde Amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion, only allowing exceptions to pay for terminating pregnancies that endanger the life of the woman, or that result from rape or incest. Since it was first enacted over 40 years ago, the amendment has been sponsored and supported by legislators who oppose abortion and object to the federal government’s use of taxpayer money for abortion services. The policy is not a permanent law but rather has been attached as a temporary “rider” to the annual Congressional appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and has been renewed annually by Congress.

This brief details the federal programs that are affected by the Hyde Amendment and laws and regulations that have a similar goal, provides estimates on the share of women insured by Medicaid affected by the law, reviews the impact of the law on their access to abortion services, and discusses the potential effect if the law were to be repealed.

What programs does the Hyde Amendment affect?

A backlash to the Roe v. Wade ruling, the Hyde Amendment initially only affected federal funding for abortions under Medicaid, a state and federal health program for individuals with low incomes. Because Congress reauthorizes the Hyde Amendment annually as an attachment to the appropriations bill for HHS, it also restricts federal abortion funding under the Indian Health Service, Medicare, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Over the years, language similar to that in the Hyde Amendment has been incorporated into a range of other federal programs that provide or pay for health services to people who could become pregnant, including the military’s TRICARE program, federal prisons, the Peace Corps, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (Appendix Table 2). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a provision that applies the Hyde restrictions to Marketplace plans, ensuring that federal funds are only used to subsidize coverage for pregnancy terminations that endanger the life of the woman or that are a result of rape or incest. Marketplace insurers can offer a plan the covers abortions beyond the federal limitations, but federal funds cannot be used towards this coverage. There are also federal rules on how insurers must segregate the funds used toward the premium for abortion coverage.

Because Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, states can choose to pay for abortions for Medicaid enrollees in other instances but must use their own revenues, and not federal funds, to cover the service. Currently, abortion remains legal in 36 states and DC (although states vary in their gestational limits). Of these states, 17 have a policy directing the use of their own funds to pay for abortions for women with low incomes insured by Medicaid beyond the Hyde limitations, nine of which provide coverage as the result of a court order (Figure 1). Most recently, there has been litigation challenging Pennsylvania’s policy to restrict abortion coverage for Medicaid enrollees. In January 2024, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution “secures the fundamental right to reproductive autonomy, which includes a right to have an abortion or carry a pregnancy to term.” The lower court will review the case in light of this ruling and depending on the ruling, Pennsylvania could become the 18th state to use its state funds to pay for abortion services for Medicaid enrollees. In the remaining states and the District of Columbia where abortion is not banned, almost all state programs do not pay for abortions for enrollees beyond the Hyde exceptions. In a few of these states, however, abortion coverage is still very restricted, but state programs use state funds to extend coverage to very limited situations where the pregnant person’s health is at risk or there is a fetal anomaly.

Intersection of state laws banning abortion and the Hyde Amendment

Federal courts have ruled that the Medicaid statute, as modified by the Hyde Amendment, requires states to pay for abortions that fall under the Hyde Exceptions and have blocked enforcement of state statutes that prohibit coverage for these exceptions. The federal government has stated that the Hyde Amendment requires coverage in cases of rape, incest, and life endangerment. In 1998, in a letter to all the state Medicaid directors explaining a change to the Hyde Amendment, Health and Human Services stated that: “All abortions covered by the Hyde Amendment, including those abortions related to rape or incest, are medically necessary services and are required to be provided by states participating in the Medicaid program.” However, a 2022 Congressional Research Service (CRS) overview of the Hyde Amendment, published after the Dobbs decision, lists open questions, such as whether payment for travel for abortion services also falls under the scope of the Hyde Amendment and conjectures that the interplay of state abortion bans and laws and the Amendment may be relitigated.

Despite this clear guidance, and court precedent, historically the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has not taken any enforcement action against states for failing to comply with covering abortion in all of the circumstances required by Hyde. A 2019 GAO study of state policies regarding Medicaid coverage of abortion found that South Dakota’s Medicaid program only covers abortions in the case of life endangerment, but no action was taken by CMS.

Since the Dobbs ruling, people living in many states cannot legally obtain an abortion in their state in all the Hyde circumstances including rape or incest. Fourteen states have banned abortion, and although all of these bans contain exceptions to safeguard the life of the pregnant person, most do not have exceptions for cases of rape or incest, and therefore, would not allow for the provision of those services to Medicaid enrollees in those states (Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas). Rarely, some Medicaid enrollees may be able to travel out of state and have a clinic bill their home state Medicaid for an abortion in the Hyde circumstances. For example, a clinic in Minnesota, where abortion is legal, provides abortions to North Dakota Medicaid enrollees and bills North Dakota Medicaid when the abortion qualifies for a Hyde circumstance. However, most Medicaid enrollees living in states where abortion is banned will not be able to use their coverage for an abortion that qualifies as a Hyde circumstance. There are practically no abortion providers in states where abortion is banned, and people who can travel out of state will most likely not be able to find a provider able to bill their home state’s Medicaid program.

Additionally, some states have extensive reporting requirements for cases of rape and incest that may be acting in conflict with the agency’s guidance. In a 1993 letter to all Medicaid directors, Sally K. Richardson, the director of the Medicaid Bureau at CMS, wrote that state-established reporting requirements for rape or incest “may not serve as an additional coverage requirement to deny or impede payment for abortion where pregnancies result from rape or incest. The State must establish procedures which permit the reporting requirements to be waived and the procedure reimbursed if the treating physician certified that in his or her professional opinion, the patient was unable, for physical or psychological reasons to comply with the reporting requirements.” The 2019 GAO study found that states have a variety of invasive requirements for women claiming abortion coverage under Hyde including provider certification of rape, incest, or life endangerment; beneficiary certification of rape or incest; documentation (such as police report or report with a public health agency) of rape or incest; prior authorization; and prior certification of counseling for the abortion. For example, since 2013, Iowa has required formal approval from the Office of the Governor in order to secure reimbursement for any abortions covered by Medicaid.

Another requirement of the Medicaid program is that all drugs included in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must be covered. Mifeprex, the prescription drug most commonly used for medication abortions, is a drug included in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, and therefore must be covered by all state Medicaid programs. Most abortions occur in the first trimester when medication abortion is an option, and over half of abortions nationally are now medication abortions. However, the same 2019 GAO report found that 14 state Medicaid programs did not cover Mifeprex.

What is the Hyde Amendment’s impact on women on Medicaid?

Medicaid is a significant source of health coverage for women who have higher rates of abortion in the U.S. including women with low incomes, and women of color. Today, Medicaid covers one in five women (20%) of reproductive age (15-49 years) living in Hyde states. In 2022, over half (51%) of women below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) living in Hyde states were insured by Medicaid (Figure 2). This number is decreasing, though, with the unwinding of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) protections put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that had allowed people to maintain their Medicaid coverage throughout the PHE. However, the program will continue to remain the main source of coverage for young women with low incomes.

Since the Dobbs ruling, the number of abortions nationally has risen compared to the pre-Dobbs period. However, there is large variation between states and regions. While there has been an increase in the number of abortions in states where it remains legal, there have been steep drops in states with bans (to nearly 0) and gestational limits. Some people in states with bans have been able to travel to other states to obtain abortions. However, there are significant financial and logistical obstacles to traveling for an out of state abortion, and many people with low incomes may not have the funds and resources to do so.

Without coverage for abortion under Medicaid, women must pay out-of-pocket for the procedure or rely on abortion funds or borrow money from friends or family to cover the costs. Costs vary by location, facility, and gestational age, but in 2021, the median out-of-pocket costs a first trimester abortion were $568 for a medication abortion and $625 for a procedural abortion. The costs of abortion are higher in the second trimester compared to the first, with median self-pay of $775. Abortion costs are higher in states with more restrictive policies and even more for people living in states with abortion bans (when you take into account the cost of travel, childcare lodging, lost wages, and abortion care itself). Though the vast majority (~90%) of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy, the costs are challenging for many people with low incomes. According to the Federal Reserve Board, 37% of U.S. adults do not have enough savings to pay for a $400 emergency expense. People covered by Medicaid in states that use state funds to pay for abortion have no out-of-pocket costs for abortion. State Medicaid programs only cover services provided in the state. So, people are not able to travel to another state and use their own state Medicaid coverage to pay for services.

The Turnaway Study found that many of those who received an abortion at any gestational period faced logistical barriers, including difficulty finding a provider and raising funds for the procedure and travel, but these barriers were more common and had greater consequences for those seeking an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation. It is more difficult to find a provider for abortions later in pregnancy and the procedure is more expensive. Approximately 4% of abortions are performed at 16 weeks or later in the pregnancy. For people with medically complicated health situations or who need a second-trimester abortion, the costs can be prohibitive. In some cases, people find they have to delay their abortion while they take time to raise funds or in other cases, they were not able to obtain abortions because they cannot afford the costs of the procedure. Furthermore, people who first learn of a fetal anomaly in the second trimester when the costs are considerably higher can face significant costs if they seek to terminate a pregnancy that may not be viable.

What would be the impact on abortion coverage if the Hyde Restrictions were lifted?

For many people with low incomes, the lack of Medicaid coverage for abortion is a major barrier to abortion access that existed long before the Dobbs decision. One study from before the Dobbs decision estimated that 29% of pregnant Medicaid-eligible women in Louisiana would have had abortions instead of giving birth if Medicaid covered abortions. Not surprisingly, states that do not use state funds to cover abortions outside of the Hyde limitations pay for substantially fewer abortions. In 2014, 52% of abortion patients residing in states that use their own funds to pay for abortion had the procedure covered by Medicaid, compared to 1.5% of patients who lived in states adhering to Hyde restrictions. This stark differential strongly suggests that if abortion coverage were to be expanded under Medicaid, more people would qualify for abortion coverage, and the number of abortions paid for by the program would rise. Today, 5.5 million women are enrolled in Medicaid and live in states where abortion remains legal, but the program will not cover the service except for limited Hyde circumstances (Figure 3).

However, the extent of the change in Medicaid-funded abortions would likely vary considerably by state as it would be affected by a range of factors, including state laws, reimbursement rates, and the availability of providers. For example, some states already have (or could enact) laws that prohibit state dollars from being used for abortion in the same way that they now ban coverage through private plans and the ACA Marketplace plans. Advocates who support abortion rights are working to counteract these efforts through federal legislation such as the Abortion Justice Act and the EACH Woman Act, which would both seek to prohibit the federal and state governments from restricting insurance coverage for abortion in both public and private health insurance programs. Beyond Hyde, these advocates are working to expand and protect abortion access through court challenges to bans and efforts to pass state and federal laws. Advocates who oppose abortion are working to make Hyde permanent law and are endorsing the passage of federal legislation, such as amending Title I8 of the United States Code, to prohibit abortion in cases where a fetal heartbeat is detectable, and to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act that would make Hyde-type restrictions on abortion funding permanent and applicable government-wide, rather than as a temporary policy rider. In a divided Congress, none of these proposals are likely to be enacted.

Removing the Hyde amendment from the appropriations bill would not automatically grant abortion coverage to women covered under other programs with Hyde-like restrictions. In order for Peace Corps workers, federal employees, and others who are receiving federally funded health benefits (outside of the HHS Appropriations bill) to obtain abortion coverage, the Hyde-like provisions would need to be lifted from the Congressionally approved appropriations bills that fund those federal programs. For women covered by Indian Health Services, TRICARE, or Veteran Affairs to obtain abortion coverage, additional congressional action would be required to change the authorizing laws (Appendix Table 2).

Despite higher shares of people with private insurance and Medicaid resulting from the coverage expansions established by the ACA, coverage for abortion services remains limited. Pregnant people who qualify for Medicaid are by definition low-income and will likely struggle to find the resources to pay for their abortions. While the removal of the Hyde Amendment could broaden this abortion coverage for millions of women with low incomes who receive federally subsidized health coverage, the true impact of such a policy change would vary by program and state, especially given the context of the abortion bans. Forty years after the first time the Hyde Amendment was first applied to a federal appropriations bill, the law is still being debated, reflecting the persistently polarized nature of the abortion debate in the United States."

Mar 13 2024,16 Republican AGs threaten Maine over protections for trans care and abortion,Advocate,left,https://advocate.com/politics/republicans-threaten-maine-health-care,"Republican attorneys general from 16 states are threatening to sue Maine if it passes a law shielding providers of gender-affirming care and abortion from out-of-state legal action.

Maine legislators are considering a bill, Legislative Document 227, which “aims to protect health care providers from subpoenas or warrants, health records requests, extradition requests and other civil or criminal proceedings if they provide care — including abortion and gender-affirming care — that has been banned in a patient’s home state,” the Portland Press Herald reports. It would also allow these health care professionals to sue out-of-state officials who take action against them.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have adopted similar “shield laws” regarding abortion providers, and 11 states and D.C. have such laws regarding providers of gender-affirming care.

The letter from the Republican AGs, led by Jonathan Skrmetti of Tennessee, claims that LD 227 “violates the United States Constitution and flouts the federalist structure that allows each of our States to engage in self-government responsive to the will of our citizens.”

“LD 227’s ill-considered attempt to influence and intimidate officials in other States could also trigger a rapid tit-for-tat escalation that tears apart our Republic,” the letter continues. “One could easily envision a First Amendment Protection Act that creates state law liability for people, even people out of state, who seek to suppress purported hate speech, or a Second Amendment Protection Act that creates liability for those who seek to regulate firearms.”

“If Maine pursues LD 227’s constitutionally defective approach, we will vigorously avail ourselves of every recourse our Constitution provides,” the missive concludes.

In addition to Skrmetti, the letter, dated Monday. is signed by AGs from Arkansas, Louisiana, Florida, Montana, Idaho, Nebraska, Indiana, Oklahoma, Iowa, South Carolina, Kansas, Texas, Kentucky, and West Virginia. It is addressed to Maine Gov. Janet Mills and other statewide Maine officials, all Democrats.

Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, issued a statement saying the letter highlights the need to pass LD 227. “This threat from Republican attorneys general makes clear that people opposed to safe, legal, life-saving medical care in Maine will continue their attacks with complete disregard for standard of care medicine and patient and provider needs,” she said, according to the Press Herald. “If there was any doubt that reproductive health care and care for transgender people is under attack in Maine, this threat from out-of-state actors should serve as the latest proof that Maine needs to protect our providers, our health care infrastructure and access to this care. We cannot let politicians or politically motivated attorneys general interfere with safe, legal medical care in our state.”

Recently, Maine lawmakers abandoned a bill that would have offered similar protections to individuals who come to Maine to access gender-affirming care that is banned in their home states. Anti-transgender activist Chaya Raichik had campaigned against the bill on her Libs of TikTok social media account.

The Maine legislature’s Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee plans to hold a work session on LD 227 in the near future, Maine's public broadcasting service reports."
Mar 13 2024,Demand for reproductive care in Oregon rises as border states crack down on abortion,Axios,left,https://axios.com/local/portland/2024/03/13/demand-obgyn-abortion-rises-oregon-idaho,"Nearly two years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, reproductive health providers in Oregon — where abortion is considered a right under the state Constitution — are still seeing high demand for services as neighboring states crack down on the procedure. Why it matters: Healthcare providers focused on family planning have expanded the services they offer and hired additional help to fit the needs of both in-state and out-of-state patients, who often need extra assistance with travel, lodging and coordinated care.

Driving the news: Idaho — Oregon's closest neighbor with a near-total abortion ban — lost 22% of its OBGYNs since the top court overturned Roe, leaving half of the state's 44 counties without practicing obstetricians, a new report found.

What they're saying: Alyssa Colwill, medical director of family care services at Oregon Health & Science University, told Axios that Oregon is seeing patients from a variety of states where abortion access has been curtailed and noted a ""definite strain in order to meet the needs of people who do come here.""

OHSU has increased its obstetrics recruitment in response, she said, and the department is now serving more of the state's hospital systems.

The big picture: 21 states have moved to ban or restrict abortion since 2022, and 16 states plus Washington, D.C., have measures in place to protect abortion rights.

Data: Society of Family Planning, U.S. Census Bureau; Note: Includes abortions provided by clinics, private medical offices, hospitals and virtual-only clinics and excludes telehealth abortions provided under shield laws. 2022 population estimates used. Abortion counts rounded to nearest 10; Chart: Simran Parwani/Axios

By the numbers: The number of abortions performed in Oregon jumped 14% from April 2022 to September 2023 — 840 to 960, respectively — according to a February report from the Society of Family Planning.

The Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive research and policy organization, estimates that 11% of abortions performed in Oregon from January to June last year were patients traveling from out of state.

The intrigue: The rising need for reproductive care in Oregon isn't limited to only abortions.

Jessica Keersemaker, vice president of patient services at Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette, told Axios that STI testing and treatment and birth control — including vasectomies — ""have and remain in high demand"" for patients in Oregon and Washington.

Zoom in: Colwill also cited an increase in the number of complex pregnancies she's seen where there have been fetal anomalies or poor prognoses.

""When people have complicated pregnancies they want to come to a state where all options are discussed.""

Of note: Because the number of patients from out of state has risen, staff at OHSU are now responsible for coordinating care, and often connecting patients with community organizations (like the Northwest Abortion Access Fund and the Cascades Abortion Support Collective) to assist with the logistics of travel, lodging and funding.

The bottom line: Several studies show the number of abortions performed in the country has not decreased since the Dobbs decision overturned Roe."

The attorney generals of multiple Republican-led states, including Texas, Florida, and Kentucky, vowed to “vigorously” challenge any state, including Maine, that may try to shield providers or patients from their states trying to access those procedures in other states where they're legal, which they see as an ""end around"" of their laws.

""My reaction is, I proposed the bill and what I’m really proposing to do is what I call ‘state sovereignty,’” Rep. Anne Perry, (D-Calais), said. “This allows anyone who has services in this state protection from another state coming in and charging someone with something that was illegal in the other state.""

Also read:

They argue the bill could result in an ""eye-for-an-eye"" response, saying,



“From a practical perspective, LD 227’s ill-considered attempt to influence and intimidate officials in other states could also trigger a rapid tit-for-tat escalation that tears apart our republic.”

""We need to recognize, always, when we consider law, that there will be an abuse of the law. That we have to make sure we provide protection, and the best protection for a child is always their parent,” Sen. Lisa Keim, (R-Oxford), said. “So we have to make sure that we have upheld parents' rights and allow them to be the ones that will protect their children in any sort of medical procedures.""



The bill also prohibits states that ban abortions from using Maine’s resources in any potential legal actions."

Vice President Kamala Harris visited Phoenix Friday as part of her nationwide Reproductive Freedoms Tour.

Harris since January has been visiting battleground states to highlight local challenges to abortion rights. Arizona was the fifth stop on the tour. Harris spoke to about 200 supporters at the South Mountain Community Center alongside Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, Congressman Greg Stanton, and Angela Florez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Arizona.

Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks in Arizona, but Harris pointed out the state’s Supreme Court is currently weighing whether a near-total abortion ban dating to 1864 should go back into effect.

Katherine Davis-Young/KJZZ Vice President Kamala Harris speaks in Phoenix on March 8, 2024.

""1864, before women had the right to vote, before women could own property, before Arizona was even admitted as a state,"" Harris said. ""Look, these extremists, they’re trying to take women back to the 1800s, but we’re not going to let them.""

Harris said abortion rights voter initiatives have been successful in several other states in the year and a half since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Reproductive rights groups in Arizona are gathering signatures in hopes of putting a measure on ballots to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution.

Mar 11 2024,Republican states threaten to sue Maine over abortion and transgender care bill,Bangor Daily News,left,https://bangordailynews.com/2024/03/11/politics/state-politics/republican-states-threaten-sue-maine-abortion-transgender-care-bill,"AUGUSTA, Maine — Top prosecutors in 16 Republican-led states issued a letter to Maine Democrats that threatened a lawsuit if they pass a “shield” bill aiming to protect out-of-state patients that get abortions and gender-affirming care here.

The letter from Republican attorneys general, which was first reported by Fox News and was posted online by state Rep. Laurel Libby, R-Auburn, on Monday, came less than a week after a public hearing drew a large crowd of conservatives to a State House hearing to oppose the measure backed by abortion-rights and progressive groups including Planned Parenthood.

It is a product of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to end federal abortion rights and amounts to a rare example of politicians in other states mobilizing against legislation here. The bill is now shaping up to be the subject of one of the bigger cultural fights in Augusta this year.

The bill from Rep. Anne Perry, D-Calais, aims to protect out-of-state patients and health care providers who perform abortions and gender-affirming surgery from prosecution or litigation in states that have banned or limited those procedures. Those protected could use the Maine courts to sue agencies in conservative-led states under the measure.

Roughly half of states have moved to ban or severely restrict abortions since the high court overturned Roe v. Wade, according to the abortion-rights Guttmacher Institute. Democratic states like Maine have moved in the opposite direction, with roughly a dozen states enacting shield protections around either abortion or gender-affirming care.

These laws have not yet been tested in the courts. But the letter from the attorneys general led by Jonathan Skrmetti of Tennessee threatens a lawsuit, saying the shield law stands out nationally for allowing lawsuits in this manner and threatens to undermine the federalist system of government leaving many issues to the states.

“The totalitarian impulse to stifle dissent and oppress dissenters has no place in our shared America,” the attorneys general wrote.

The letter was addressed to top Democrats including Mills and Attorney General Aaron Frey. Frey’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the letter.

Mills has been an ardent proponent of abortion-rights expansions. She issued an executive order after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022 that barred state personnel from aiding abortion investigations in other jurisdictions and championed a controversial law last year that allowed doctors to perform post-viability abortions over steadfast Republican opposition.

The letter from the top Republican officials in other states is similar to one issued last year in opposition to a rule change from President Joe Biden’s administration aimed at shielding abortion records from investigators in other states. They argued it would hamper their ability to enforce their own laws.

“Given the national climate, it is more important than ever that Maine join this growing movement, affirm its commitment to essential health care, and pursue every possible avenue to safeguard providers in our state,” Lisa Margulies, a vice president for public affairs at Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said in testimony backing the Maine bill last week."
Mar 01 2024,CVS and Walgreens Will Begin Selling Abortion Pills This Month,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/01/health/abortion-pills-cvs-walgreens.html,"The two largest pharmacy chains in the United States will start dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone this month, a step that could make access easier for some patients.

Officials at CVS and Walgreens said in interviews on Friday that they had received certification to dispense mifepristone under guidelines that the Food and Drug Administration issued last year. The chains plan to make the medication available in stores in a handful of states at first. They will not be providing the medication by mail.

Both chains said they would gradually expand to all other states where abortion was legal and where pharmacies were legally able to dispense abortion pills — about half of the states.

President Biden said in a statement on Friday that the availability of the pill at pharmacies was “an important milestone in ensuring access to mifepristone, a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as safe and effective for more than 20 years.”"
Mar 12 2024,Judicial Rulemaking Body Moves To Block Conservative Strategy Behind Abortion Pill Case,HuffPost,left,https://huffpost.com/entry/conservative-judge-shopping-new-rule-ban_n_65f0b04be4b02ad7de1aa7a5,"LOADING ERROR LOADING

The Judicial Conference of the United States announced new rules for the federal judiciary Tuesday that would prevent the practice of judge-shopping, where litigants choose where to file their suit based on the near-certain knowledge that a specific judge will hear their case.

Judge-shopping has come under increasing fire since President Joe Biden was elected. Conservative activist groups have sought to block his administration’s policies by filing lawsuits in federal courthouses where they expect to draw a sympathetic conservative judge to hear their case. Often the justification for the filing location rests only on a tenuous connection to the region.

The most glaring example occurred in the twin cases now before the U.S. Supreme Court that challenge the validity of the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion drug mifepristone and the Biden administration’s rules allowing the prescription drug to be mailed to patients.

Anti-abortion groups initially filed the suit at the federal courthouse in Amarillo, Texas. The location had nothing to do with any claim of harm caused by mifepristone in Amarillo. Instead, they chose that courthouse because they knew that Matthew Kacsmaryk was the only judge who drew cases there. Kacsmaryk, who was nominated by President Donald Trump and has a history of opposing reproductive rights, ruled as expected and imposed a nationwide injunction blocking the distribution of the drug in April 2023. An appeals court partially sided with Kacsmaryk, but the U.S. Supreme Court put that decision and Kacsmaryk’s injunction on hold before the month was out. Arguments in the case are scheduled before the high court on March 25.

The new rules issued by the Judicial Conference, the 26-member body that sets rules for the entire federal judiciary, save for the U.S. Supreme Court, would prevent such judge-shopping. Instead of allowing litigants to file suit in single-judge geographical divisions, the new rules, which take effect immediately, will require that a case seeking to bar or mandate actions by federal or state governments be randomly assigned to a judge from within the whole district, not just the smaller, single-judge division.

There are 13 federal circuit courts across the nation, with 11 circuits covering discrete geographical regions, one covering the District of Columbia and one for certain federal lawsuits. Texas, one of several states with single-judge districts, is within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and has within it four federal court districts (the Northern District, Eastern District, Southern District and Western District). Within those four judicial districts are 27 geographical divisions. Eight of those divisions, including the one covering the Amarillo area in the Texas Panhandle, have just one federal judge.

Under the new rules, lawsuits filed in a single-judge district will not automatically be assigned to that judge. Instead, the case will be randomly assigned to a judge from the entire judicial district.

If the mifepristone case had been filed under the new rules, for example, it would have been randomly assigned to one of the 11 U.S. district judges in the wider Northern District of Texas rather than simply going to Kacsmaryk. Ten out of those 11 judges are Republican appointees, but not all of them are known to be anti-abortion activists, such as Kacsmaryk.

The issue of judge-shopping has gained attention since Biden took office. Republicans including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and a plethora of conservative activist groups have routinely made use of Texas’ single-judge divisions to funnel cases to hard-right, Trump-appointed judges whom they expect to issue nationwide injunctions on Biden policies. Besides Kacsmaryk, federal judges Drew Tipton and James Wesley Hendrix, both Trump appointees in Texas; and Reed O’Connor, a George W. Bush appointee in Fort Worth, have also been regular targets for the filing of conservative lawsuits.

In 2021, Paxton filed suit in Kacsmaryk’s courthouse to block the Biden administration from reversing the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” immigration policy. Kacsmaryk sided with Paxton and blocked the administration from revoking the harsh policy. His decision was eventually reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court but only after the high court allowed his injunction to remain in place for a year.

In another case filed by Paxton, Tipton blocked Biden’s 2021 executive order imposing a 100-day pause on the deportation of unauthorized immigrants. The Supreme Court reversed Tipton’s decision by a lopsided 8-1 vote in 2023, but it allowed his injunction to remain in place for the two years in between, thus preventing Biden from enforcing his own immigration policies.

In February, Hendrix declared a $1.7 trillion spending bill that Congress passed in 2021 unconstitutional because proxy votes were cast in the House during the COVID-19 pandemic. Though Hendrix did not nullify the entire law, he declared part of it unenforceable against the state government: the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which mandated that employers provide accommodations to pregnant employees.

The Department of Justice challenged each of these cases, plus the Kacsmaryk mifepristone ruling in 2023, for being improper instances of judge-shopping. They argued that each case should have been filed in a different venue ― one that actually had some connection to the issue.

Lawmakers had also raised concerns about judge-shopping in recent years. Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) introduced legislation to ban the practice in 2023, as did Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

The Judicial Conference also noted a 2021 letter from former Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) stating their concerns about judge-shopping in patent cases. Additionally, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts called for a study on the assignment of judges in patent cases in his 2021 year-end statement."

(NewsNation) — Walgreens and CVS pharmacies in select states will begin selling the abortion pill mifepristone as soon as next week, the companies announced Friday.

Both pharmacy chains completed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification process to dispense mifepristone, which is a drug that blocks the hormone progesterone needed for a pregnancy to continue. It is commonly used to end a pregnancy through ten weeks gestation, according to the FDA.

Walgreens announced the drug will only be available in select locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Illinois.

“We are beginning a phased rollout in select locations to allow us to ensure quality, safety and privacy for our patients, providers and team members,” Walgreens said in a statement.

CVS will start dispensing mifepristone at pharmacies in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, Amy Thibault told NewsNation in a statement. A specific date was not mentioned, but Thibault said patients can expect the drug to be available “in the weeks ahead.”

“We’ve received certification to dispense mifepristone at CVS Pharmacy and plan to fill prescriptions for this medication in states where legally permissible. We’re working with manufacturers and suppliers to secure the medication and are not yet dispensing it in any of our pharmacies,” Thibault said in a statement.

President Joe Biden called the move an “important milestone” in ensuring access to the drug.

“With major retail pharmacy chains newly certified to dispense medication abortion, many women will soon have the option to pick up their prescription at a local, certified pharmacy—just as they would for any other medication. I encourage all pharmacies that want to pursue this option to seek certification,” the president said.

Both companies said they would not dispense the drug in states where abortion laws were unclear. However, CVS and Walgreens will continue to monitor changes in state laws in those states, the New York Times reported.

This comes at a time when abortion remains a major issue in politics, policy and U.S. courts. The abortion landscape has been in flux since the June 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, which touched off a round of abortion policy changes and new litigation around the procedure.

There are still looming ballot questions and court decisions. And lawmakers could tweak current abortion laws.

New data from the Society of Family Planning revealed the number of abortions occurring nationally each month remained about the same as in the months before the Supreme Court overruled the federal right to an abortion in 2022.

While the national monthly average remained consistent, the report tracked a significant discrepancy between states with abortion bans and those without. Guttmacher Institute found that by 2021, more than half (53%) of abortions in the country were medication abortions.

Vice President Kamala Harris went to a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota on Thursday, the first time a sitting US president or vice president is believed to visit an abortion provider.

The visit was a part of Harris’ efforts to highlight an issue the campaign believes will galvanize moderate voters in November.

“I’m here at this health care clinic to uplift the work that is happening in Minnesota as an example of what true leadership looks like,” Harris told reporters from the lobby of the clinic.

The vice president traveled to Minnesota for the sixth stop of her “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour. She toured the Planned Parenthood facility and spoke with staff about reproductive rights.

“The reason I’m here is because this is a health care crisis,” Harris said. “Part of this health care crisis is the clinics like this that have had to shut down and what that has meant to leave no options with any reasonable geographic area for so many women who need this essential care.”

Harris began the tour in January in Wisconsin, and she has since held events in California, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona.

Harris wanted to visit a women’s health care clinic as part of her reproductive rights tour launched earlier this year, building on the meetings she’s had with patients and providers, according to a source familiar with the matter. It’s an extension of a weekslong tour to seize on an issue that’s top of mind for voters and one that Harris has emerged as a key voice on.

The Harris team has focused on reproductive rights as a salient political issue that they believed the vice president was uniquely positioned to lead on, building on what advisers and campaign officials viewed as a success with her college campus tour. The issue has been top of mind for the vice president, dating back to 2021, when she held a reproductive rights roundtable.

Minnesota marked the fifth state Harris has visited since the president’s State of the Union address last week. Prepared remarks from the president’s address included the word abortion, but the president did not say the word when he delivered the speech.

In 2023, Minnesota’s Democratic Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill into law that enshrines the “fundamental right” to access abortion in the state.

The vice president’s visit to Minnesota came during what the Biden campaign is calling the “March Month of Action” which includes plans for President Joe Biden and Harris to travel to every battleground state this month.

The vice president has drawn on testimonials to underscore the impacts of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

It’s all part of a broader Biden campaign strategy that officials plotted for months, aware of the need to mobilize young voters and voters of color amid waning enthusiasm and utilizing what they view as one of the vice president’s strengths: engaging with people on the road.

But it hasn’t been without its hiccups.

Harris has occasionally faced protestors on her reproductive freedoms tour, including one group that declined to participate over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The campaign is focused on making abortion a centerpiece of its messaging as it seeks to court moderate voters – particularly women.

About half of registered voters in the United States say this year’s elections will have a “major impact” on access to abortion, and about 1 in 8 voters says that abortion is the most important issue driving their vote, according to a new KFF survey.

The legislation calls for the department to describe South Dakota’s bans, which prohibits nearly all abortions, other than to preserve the life of the female.

The video and materials will describe acts that do and don’t constitute an abortion. They’ll also cover:

The most common medical conditions that threaten the life or health of a pregnant woman.

The generally accepted standards of care applicable to the treatment of a pregnant woman experiencing life-threatening or health-threatening medical conditions; and

The criteria that a practitioner, exercising reasonable medical judgment, might use in determining the best course of treatment for a pregnant woman experiencing life-threatening or health-threatening medical conditions and for her unborn child.

The legislation also directs the department to consult with the state attorney general and stakeholders who have medical and legal expertise.

Republican Sen. Erin Tobin was the only lawmaker who spoke in support of the bill Thursday. Senate Democratic leader Reynold Nesiba said it’s likely an abortion-rights amendment will be on November election ballot. He said South Dakota law prohibits using state funds to influence an election, including for a ballot issue.

“I think we’re going to get sued if you pass this bill,” Nesiba warned.

But Tobin replied that the video will only be informational. “It does not affect anyone’s opinion,” she said."
Mar 15 2024,Appeals court upholds parental consent for birth control; Texas Medical Board to clarify abortion exceptions,Texas Standard,center,https://texasstandard.org/stories/fifth-circuit-appeals-court-texas-medical-board-parental-consent-birth-control-abortion-exceptions,"A U.S. appeals court has upheld a Texas law mandating parental consent for teenagers seeking birth control at federally funded clinics.

“The federal program looks at free contraception for everyone,” Texas Tribune senior managing editor Ayan Mittra explains. “And so the justices on the court, in making this ruling affirming this lower court’s ruling about requiring parental consent to obtain contraception, they basically said that this ruling in this decision really doesn’t conflict with the federal program because the federal program focuses on encouraging family participation.”

Another crucial update in reproductive health involves the Texas Medical Board’s plan to provide additional guidance on medical exceptions to the state’s stringent abortion restrictions.

After the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision at the U.S. Supreme Court took away the constitutional right to abortion, focus has sharpened on exemptions to the ban, Mittra notes.

“One of the things that’s in Texas law is an exception for abortions when it comes to life-threatening medical conditions,” he said. “And so what’s resulted from that is that there’s been confusion about what actually qualifies as that.”

The board is slated to discuss exemptions on March 22.

Mar 08 2024,France enshrines abortion as a constitutional right as the world marks International Women’s Day,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/international-womens-day-france-abortion-constitution-e9475951b59cd5778b9741aa4a21f339,"PARIS (AP) — France inscribed the guaranteed right to abortion in its constitution Friday, in a world first and a powerful message of support to women around the globe on International Women’s Day.

A woman from Argentina, a couple from Miami and a man from Czechia were among those gathered on the polished cobblestones of Place Vendome in Paris to watch the historic event unfurl in an outdoor ceremony open the public. Women in the crowd recalled their own abortions, or lifelong battles for reproductive rights.

While abortion is a deeply divisive issue in the United States, it’s legal in nearly all of Europe and overwhelmingly supported in France, where it’s seen more as a question of public health rather than politics. French legislators approved the constitutional amendment on Monday in a 780-72 vote that was backed by many far-right lawmakers.

The Paris event was a key moment on a day focused on advancing women’s rights globally. Marches, protests and conferences are being held from Jakarta, Indonesia, to Mexico City and beyond.

When the French justice minister used a 19th-century printing press to seal the amendment in France’s Constitution, cheers filled the plaza. It ensures “the freedom of women to have recourse to an abortion, which is guaranteed.”

“For too many years, women’s destinies were sealed by others,’' President Emmanuel Macron said, calling Friday’s ceremony the culmination of a ‘’long fight for freedom’’ for women to choose what to do with their bodies.

The French constitutional amendment has been hailed by women’s rights advocates around the world, including places where women struggle to access birth control or maternal health care. Macron said the move was prompted by the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 rescinding long-held abortion rights.

Macron called for other countries to follow suit and proposed including the right to abortion in the European Union’s charter, drawing cheers from the crowd in Paris. However, such a move would likely meet stiff resistance from EU members that have tight abortion restrictions, such as Poland.

Macron’s critics questioned why he pursued the measure in a country with no obvious threat to abortion rights but where women face a multitude of other problems.

While some French women saw the step as a major win, others said that in reality not every French woman has access to abortion.

“It’s a smokescreen,” Arya Meroni, 32, said of the event.

“The government is destroying our health care system, many family planning clinics have closed,’’ she said at an annual “Feminist Night March” in Paris on the eve of International Women’s Day.

Still, for people like 44-year-old public relations director Lunise Marquis, it was a “major milestone for women’s rights.”

“We are sending a message to the world,” she said.

France has a persistently high rate of women killed by their partners and challenges remain in prosecuting sexual abuse against women by powerful celebrities and other men. French women also see lower pay and pensions — especially women who are not white.

Macron’s government said the abortion amendment was important to avoid a U.S.-like scenario for women in France, as hard-right groups are gaining ground and seeking to turn back the clock on freedoms around Europe.

Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti used a 100-kilogram (220-pound) press from 1810 to imprint the amendment in France’s 1958 Constitution.

France follows in the footsteps of the former Yugoslavia, whose 1974 constitution included the phrase: “A person is free to decide on having children.” Yugoslavia’s successor states retained similar language in their constitutions, though they did not spell out guaranteed abortion rights.

Not everyone saw the day as a cause for celebration, as angry protest marches were held in numerous countries.

The head of the Danish Trade Union Confederation, which has 1.3 million members, chafed at how differently women and men are treated in some areas.

“Unfortunately, we still see sky-high pay differences, professions dominated by one sex, a gender-segregated labor market, harassment cases that primarily affect women and a wide range of other equality problems,” Morten Skov Christensen said.

In other events Friday:

AP AUDIO: France enshrines abortion as a constitutional right as the world marks International Women’s Day AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports on an Irish vote on home “duties” in the constitution.

In Ireland, voters are deciding whether to change the constitution to remove passages referring to women’s domestic duties and broadening the definition of the family.

In Italy, where the country’s first female premier is in power, thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence. The issue grabbed public attention after the particularly gruesome murder of a young woman last November, which Italian President Sergio Mattarella said Friday “consumed all of Italy in horror and pain.” Data show more than half of the 120 women murdered in Italy last year were killed by their current or former partners.

At street rallies in Seoul, participants had an eye on next month’s parliamentary elections in South Korea and expressed hope that parties would prioritize gender equality.

In Russia, where the United Nations says human rights have deteriorated since the military’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin saluted Russian women fighting in the war and those waiting at home for their loved ones who had been deployed.

Women in Afghanistan staged rare protests against harsh Taliban restrictions. The country’s rulers have banned girls and women from education above grade six and from most jobs. Females are also barred from public spaces like parks. A group of women gathered indoors in Kabul, holding up signs to hide their faces, and chanted, “No to gender apartheid” and “Afghanistan is hell for women.”

Protesters in Turkey sought to call attention to violence against women.

Indonesian demonstrators demanded adoption of the International Labor Organization’s conventions concerning gender equality and eliminating workplace violence and harassment. Labor rights groups in Thailand marched to the Government House to petition for better work conditions, and activists marching against violence in the Philippine capital were stopped by police near the presidential palace, sparking a brief scuffle.

India’s government cut the price of cooking gas cylinders by 100 rupees ($1.20) with Prime Minister Narendra Modi posting on social media that the move was “in line with our commitment to empowering women.”

The United Nations children’s agency said in a report released on International Women’s Day that more than 230 million women and girls around the world have undergone female genital mutilation. The number has increased by 30 million in the past eight years, it said.

“We’re also seeing a worrying trend that more girls are subjected to the practice at younger ages, many before their fifth birthday. That further reduces the window to intervene,” said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

Officially recognized by the United Nations in 1977, International Women’s Day is a national holiday in about 20 countries, including Russia, Ukraine and Afghanistan.

Mar 12 2024,"In Denver, Vice President Kamala Harris promises to fight for “assault” weapons ban and abortion access",The Denver Post,center,https://denverpost.com/2024/03/12/kamala-harris-denver-visit-abortion-gun-reform-election-joe-biden,"Vice President Kamala Harris told supporters in Denver on Tuesday that she would fight to ban “assault” weapons, raise the federal minimum wage and protect abortion rights if she and President Joe Biden win reelection in November.

“In memory of Columbine, Aurora, Uvalde and Club Q, we continue — and we all continue — to fight for an assault weapons ban, universal background checks and red-flag laws,” Harris said in a 15-minute speech as she was met with cheers from more than 250 attendees. All of those mass shootings, except for the Uvalde school incident, happened in Colorado.

She took the stage at ReelWorks Denver, an event hall in the River North Art District, as part of a multi-state swing by Harris and Biden to tout progress on multiple fronts and amplify other messages from last week’s State of the Union address. The visit comes as both she and Biden face low approval ratings heading into a likely rematch with former President Donald Trump in the November election.

Harris said the Biden administration would invest in low-cost childcare, paid family leave and affordable housing if American voters grant them four more years in office. She also made a pledge to secure a pathway to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, or undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, and their families.

“Colorado is so important, and you will be part of deciding the future of our country,” Harris said.

Four years ago, Biden won Colorado with 55% of the vote. That makes him the favorite to win the state this year, but, nationally, the race is expected to be tight. As of Tuesday, FiveThirtyEight’s polling averages put Harris at a 36% approval rating and Biden at 37%.

Harris targeted specific populations in her speech, telling teachers: “Y’all don’t make enough money.” She also focused on Latino voters, at one point emphasizing the importance of gun reform by pointing out that “Latinos are twice as likely to be the victims of gun violence.”

More broadly, she cited White House accomplishments that included lowering health care costs — including the price of insulin — for older people, canceling about $138 billion in student loan debt through executive actions and passing the first major gun-safety law in three decades.

Prominent Colorado Democrats were on hand, including Gov. Jared Polis, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston, former Denver Mayor Federico Peña, state Rep. Tim Hernández, and Denver City Councilwoman Serena Gonzales-Gutierrez and Councilman Chris Hinds.

Ahead of Harris’ visit, Colorado Republican Party Chair Dave Williams told The Denver Post that the state’s GOP was looking forward “to restoring balance to this state come November.” He added that Coloradans were “tired of the failed agenda of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris that has resulted in higher prices for goods, lower wages, increased crime and more illegal immigration that is robbing citizens of their tax dollars and government services.”

Standing in the crowd Tuesday, Angalen Bland, 23, said she was still undecided in her vote, but leaned toward Biden.

“Getting people out to vote, especially in minority communities, is important,” she said, adding that Harris’ lively gathering “encourages that and makes it a safer, more welcoming space than your typical campaign event.”

Wearing a Biden-Harris button, Thomas Gilhooly expressed hope that the event would inspire others to engage in social justice work, while bringing attention to Denver’s migrant crisis and the city’s need for more funding.

Outside the event center, about 65 pro-Palestinian demonstrators — most of them younger people — gathered across the street ahead of Harris’ arrival, waving the flag of Palestine and holding signs critical of the administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Israel’s assault on the Gaza Strip, launched in October in response to Hamas’ deadly terror attacks in Israel, have killed tens of thousands of people and destroyed many buildings across the territory.

“All of us here do not approve of the U.S.’s actions in funding the genocide against the Palestinian people,” said Hannah Sims, a demonstrator who stood behind the yellow police tape.

The message she wanted to get across to Harris: “We hold her accountable as a woman of color, standing in power, for taking the wrong side,” Sims said. When asked who she would vote for in November, she described her stance as uncommitted.

Mar 14 2024,Kamala Harris abortion clinic visit: Vice president makes historic trip to Minnesota Planned Parenthood,Star Tribune,left,https://startribune.com/kamala-harris-abortion-clinic-minnesota/600351104,"People come to Minnesota these days in search of rights other states have taken away.

On Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris came to Minnesota to visit an abortion clinic.

Not something you can do in every state. Not anymore. The new conservative majority on the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the constitutional right to an abortion.

The vice president's visit to Planned Parenthood in St. Paul is a historic first. The facility provides abortions, as well as contraception and education. No American president or vice president has ever been known to set foot in an abortion clinic. Wild, considering how much time America's politicians spend legislating about the topic. And the trip comes at a crucial moment.

One by one, everyday rights we took for granted are being stripped or attacked. Don't want to get pregnant? Some states imposed abortion bans so sweeping they rule out entire categories of birth control. You do want to get pregnant? Hope you don't live in Alabama, where the state Supreme Court says all the embryos you froze for your IVF treatments are people now.

Families are migrating to Minnesota in search of schools with unbanned books and legislatures that don't want to be the arbiters of which bathroom their child can use and what medical care they deserve to receive. Minnesota passed a transgender refuge law last year. Refuge from politicians who think the opposite of ""woke"" is cruelty.

So the vice president did what few politicians do these days. She visited an abortion clinic and listened to the people who came to Planned Parenthood for care.

She listened to health care workers who talked about the services they provide. Abortions, yes, but also cancer screenings, birth control and sex ed for patients who might otherwise be getting their information from TikTok.

She listened to the stories of the women who came here for care. Most of them mothers already. More and more of them traveling hundreds of miles for care they can no longer find at home.

When you stop talking about other people's abortions and start listening, you learn the sort of stories Harris has heard from families across the country. Stories of women who have faced prosecution for miscarriages. Women begging for help in the emergency room as doctors hesitate, afraid of running afoul of new state laws that could send them to prison.

""So I'm here at this health care clinic to uplift the work that is happening in Minnesota as an example of what true leadership looks like,"" Harris said. ""It is only right and fair that people have access to the health care that they need ... in an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect.""

One out of every four Americans who can get pregnant will have an abortion by the time they turn 45, according to estimates by the Guttmacher Institute. It used to be one out of three, but states made access punishingly difficult, even before the bans.

South Dakota's lone abortion provider used to have to fly in from Minnesota, before the Dakotas banned abortion outright. Now, you can't get an abortion in South Dakota. But don't look to state lawmakers if your children are hungry. South Dakota was one of 15 states that opted out of federal funding for summer nutritional programs for children.

School lunches are free in Minnesota."
Mar 07 2024,43% of GOP voters say abortion should be legal in most cases: Poll,NewsNation,center,https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/abortion/gop-voters-on-abortion-poll/,"(NewsNation) — About four in ten Republican voters believe abortion should be legal in “all or most cases,” according to a new poll.

Among that group of voters, the KFF tracking poll found that 52% of them trust the GOP more on the issue of abortion. Just 8% said they trust the Democratic Party. Thirty-three percent said they didn’t trust either party on the issue.

In June, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade case, ending constitutional protections for abortion that had been in place for nearly 50 years.

Since then, the decision has galvanized some Democratic lawmakers and candidates into making the issue a key issue in the 2024 election.

Navigating the court’s decision has been more difficult for Republicans.

In the two elections since Roe v. Wade was overturned, abortion drove voters to the polls. Republicans who pushed more stringent restrictions saw losses during the 2022 midterms and elections in 2023.

During last year’s midterms, voters in California, Vermont and Michigan backed measures to enshrine abortion access within the state constitution, and voters in the red state of Kentucky shot down a measure that would have banned it.

Meanwhile, in November, battleground state voters made Ohio the fourth state to constitutionally protect abortion access. Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s best efforts to gain control of both chambers of the state legislature were additionally upset by Democrats who took complete control of the statehouse, blocking efforts to pass new abortion restrictions.

According to the KFF poll, about 1 in 8 voters say abortion is the top factor influencing how they’ll vote in the 2024 elections, with the issue resonating particularly with Black and Democratic women and those ages 18 to 49."
Mar 01 2024,Montana abortion laws ruled unconstitutional and void in Billings court,KTVQ 2,center,https://ktvq.com/news/local-news/montana-abortion-laws-ruled-unconstitutional-and-void-in-billings-court,"A judge in Yellowstone County blocked three abortion laws.

In 2021, the Montana legislature passed laws dealing with the pain-capable Unborn Child Protection Act, ultrasounds, and abortion-inducing drugs.

The court suspended those laws that same year.

Read the ruling here.

In his ruling, Judge Kurt Krueger stated the laws ""invade the private treatment room.""

He also wrote: ""The Court finds all three laws incompatible with the text of the Montana Constitution and values it recognizes, and therefore deems them void and unenforceable.""

Dr. Samuel Dickman, Planned Parenthood of Montana chief medical officer, supports the ruling.

""Montana's constitution is very clear,” said Dickman. “It says the people of Montana deserve and have a very strong right to privacy. And the state Supreme Court affirmed that and said in the Armstrong decision, that includes abortion.""

Others such as Jeff Laszloffy, Montana Family Foundation president, say the laws are unconstitutional because of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

""The logic in overturning Roe v. Wade held that it should not have been premised on a right to privacy,” Laszloffy said. “We believe that if Roe v. Wade falls then since the Armstrong decision in Montana was modeled after Roe, the Armstrong decision should fall as well.""

House Bill 136 would have prohibited the abortion of an unborn child capable of feeling pain starting at 20 weeks.

House Bill 140 would have required that women be afforded the opportunity to view an ultrasound and listen to the fetal heart tone.

And House Bill 171 would have restricted certain abortion medications.

“One of the laws would have banned all telemedicine-based medication abortion,” Dickman said. “In a state like Montana, I have patients who travel five or six hours for an abortion. For a lot of patients, they just can't do that.""

In his ruling, the judge wrote that the law is restrictive, saying it is not up to legislators to substitute their personal values and beliefs for the collective professional judgment and expertise of properly licensed medical providers.

""The Legislature gets involved in issues like this all the time,” said Laszloffy. “And when (the judge) talks about the professional medical community, he needs to remember that he's talking about a very minute group of doctors that perform abortions for profit.""

""Patients want to be able to see a medical provider and feel like they are getting the best possible medical care, without interference from politicians,"" Dickman said.

Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, says the state will appeal the order.

“Attorney General Knudsen remains committed to protecting the health and safety of women and unborn babies in Montana,” said Emilee Cantrell, the communications director for the attorney general."

(KWCH) - The Kansas House of Representatives passes a bill this week that would require abortion providers to ask patients additional questions about why they’re seeking an abortion. Those responses will be reported to the state.

Abortion rights opponents say the bill intends to collect better data for the state about why women are seeking abortions.

“Women can refuse, just like they can refuse today, to answer the questions to the report,” said Representative Brenda Landwehr. “This bill is not intended to harass or intimidate any abortion providers.”

The bill would require providers to ask 11 additional questions to patients, including why they’re seeking to terminate a pregnancy and if their decision is impacted by their financial, career or relationship situation.

Democrats in the House pushed back on the legislation, stating that the additional questions could be intrusive for patients.

“We do not go into everybody else’s clinic appointments and have those intrusive questions then broadcast for public consumption,” said Representative Melissa Oropeza. “I am very, very concerned about this.”

The bill will now be voted on by the Senate and if it is passed, Governor Laura Kelly will have the power to veto the bill.

Mar 01 2024,Red State Judge Throws Out Three Laws Restricting Abortion,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2024/03/01/montana-judge-throws-out-laws-restricting-abortion,"A Montana judge ruled Thursday that three of the state’s laws limiting abortion were unconstitutional, according to the Daily Montanan.

The laws banned abortion after 20 weeks and by way of telehealth services, as well as required a 24-hour waiting period and two ultrasounds. District Court Judge Kurt Krueger sided with Planned Parenthood of Montana, who filed the lawsuit, arguing that the government should not be able to “infringe” on bodily autonomy any more than it can force someone to have an abortion, according to the Daily Montanan. (RELATED: Red States Considering Sex Ed Bills That Would Require Students To Watch Pro-Life Video)

“Notably, Armstrong rejected the state’s attempts to regulate abortion, not on the basis that the procedure should be protected per se, but because a woman’s right to ‘decide up to the point of fetal viability, what her pregnancy demands’ implicates her right to ‘procreative autonomy.’ If the state can infringe on that autonomy ‘in favor of birth, then, necessarily it also has the power to require abortion,’ neither of which would be acceptable,” Krueger wrote, according to the outlet.

The laws have been under a preliminary injunction for several years, barring their enforcement as the lawsuit made its way through the courts, according to KTVH, a local media outlet. The state argued in its case that the 1999 Montana Supreme Court decision declaring that the right to privacy is protected when an infant isn’t viable, was made in error.

The judge contended that “It is undisputed that no fetus is presently viable at that point” and called the 20-week ban “ideologically motivated legislation,” according to the Daily Montanan.

Krueger also took issue with Montana’s argument that states have a “compelling interest” to preserve human life following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022, according to the Daily Montanan.

“The state cites Dobbs for its assertion that it has a compelling interest in ‘respecting and preserving human life, including prenatal life at all stages of development,’ regardless of determinations of viability. But Dobbs does not control here. Federal precedent is not binding on questions of state constitutional law,” Krueger wrote.

Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, said that the organization is “relieved that Montanans will no longer live with the threat of these harmful restrictions taking effect” in a statement to the Daily Montanan. A spokesperson for Republican Attorney General Austin Knudsen said that they plan to appeal the ruling and remain “committed to protecting the health and safety of women and unborn babies in Montana,” according to KTVH.

Feb 26 2024,"Bill Filed in Ky. Adds Abortion Exceptions With Rape, Incest",Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/kentucky-legislature-abortion/2024/02/26/id/1155038,"Legislation aimed at easing Kentucky's near-total abortion ban by creating limited exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest was introduced Monday in the GOP-dominated House, as lawmakers wrangle with an issue at the forefront of last year's campaign for governor.

Republican state Rep. Ken Fleming filed the measure on the last day that new House bills could be introduced in this year's 60-day session. The bill's prospects are uncertain, with House Speaker David Osborne saying the chamber's GOP supermajority has not discussed any particular abortion bill.

Kentucky's near-total abortion ban has been in place since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The state's so-called trigger law took effect, banning abortions except when carried out to save the mother’s life or to prevent a disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Fleming's proposal would change that by making abortions legal in cases of rape and incest if done no later than six weeks after the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period, according to a statement describing the bill. The measure also would allow an abortion to remove a dead fetus and in cases of a lethal fetal anomaly, meaning the fetus wouldn't survive after birth.

“We all encounter difficult heart-wrenching decisions in life,"" Fleming said in the statement. “As a father of two daughters, I have always supported them financially, emotionally, and especially spiritually. With them on my mind and in my heart, exceptions for life-saving measures for the mother and in cases involving rape or incest should be included in our state’s abortion law.”

Current exceptions to save the mother's life or prevent disabling injuries would remain under his bill.

The measure also includes a provision creating a process for physicians to document the circumstances surrounding an abortion performed under state law.

The last-minute bill filing mirrors another GOP lawmaker's attempt last year to relax the state's abortion ban. That measure, also filed on the last day for bill introductions in the House, made no headway as the abortion issue was skipped over in 2023 by the legislature's Republican supermajorities.

The issue rose to the forefront of Kentucky's hotly contested governor's race last year. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, an abortion-rights supporter who won reelection to a second term, hammered away at his Republican challenger's support of the state’s sweeping abortion ban.

Kentucky’s Supreme Court refused to strike down the ban last year. The justices, however, ruled on narrow legal issues but left unanswered the larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the Bluegrass State.

In late 2023, a Kentucky woman sued to demand the right to an abortion, but her attorneys later withdrew the lawsuit after she learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity. In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure aimed at denying any constitutional protections for abortion.

Kentucky is one of 14 states with a ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy currently in effect.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion, bans of some kind have kicked in in most Republican-controlled states. Two — Georgia and South Carolina — ban abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, around six weeks into pregnancy and before women often realize they’re pregnant. Utah and Wyoming have bans on abortion throughout pregnancy, but enforcement has been paused by courts while they weigh whether the laws comply with the state constitutions."
Mar 06 2024,Abortion meds can now be sold in drugstores. Here’s why that’s so important.,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/even-better/2024/3/5/24091215/mifepristone-abortion-cvs-walgreens-drugstores-retail-pharmacies-prescribers,"On March 1, the New York Times reported that over the following few weeks, some retail pharmacies owned by Walgreens and CVS will begin dispensing mifepristone, a key drug used in medication abortions.

It’s a big change: Before the pandemic, people could only obtain the drug in-person at the office or clinic of the health care provider who prescribed it. But in 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed that in-person dispensing requirement, opening the door to getting abortion medications through the mail — an important second option for people seeking an abortion. At the same time, the agency said it would create a pathway for retail pharmacies to get certified to dispense mifepristone, giving Americans a third way to access the drug.

In early 2023, less than a year after the US Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, the FDA finalized changes to its rules that newly allowed brick-and-mortar pharmacies to dispense the drug. (Although the FDA can’t decide in which states abortion is legal or whether there’s a national right to abortion, it can and often does modify its rules that determine who can prescribe drugs used in having an abortion; who can dispense them; and what hoops prescribers, patients, and pharmacies have to jump through when they’re used.) Late last year, independent pharmacies began dispensing the drug, and last week’s news indicates national pharmacy chains are also getting on board.

This moment might feel like the culmination of something, but it’s really just the start, says Kirsten Moore, who directs the Expanding Medication Abortion Access Project. “We have finally reached the end of the beginning phase of expanding access,” she says.

In the short term, the move gives Americans another avenue for accessing a critical medication. But it will likely have even more important effects on improving abortion access in the long term, says Julia Kaye, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union who led the litigation culminating in the FDA’s 2021 loosening of mifepristone restrictions.

Before these changes were set into motion, health care workers had to “effectively act as both the prescriber and the pharmacist,” Kaye says. Now, however, prescribers will be able to either use a mail order pharmacy or send a prescription to a local pharmacy for the patient to pick up — just as they would any other equally safe drug.

Anti-abortion activists have throttled mifepristone access from the start by burying it under piles of arbitrary restrictions

Mifepristone works by blocking the progesterone hormone. During pregnancy, progesterone helps keep the lining of the uterus intact; without it, a pregnancy cannot go on. In the context of an abortion, mifepristone is usually used in conjunction with misoprostol, a drug that relaxes the opening to the uterus and helps the uterus contract and empty itself. (Misoprostol can already be legally dispensed in drugstores.)

The FDA’s official labeling for mifepristone indicates it’s approved for inducing abortions and, in a different formulation, treating a hormonal condition called Cushing’s syndrome. But like many other drugs, mifepristone also has “off-label” uses. An important one: It can speed up miscarriages once they’ve already begun, which helps reduce the need for surgery in these cases.

When mifepristone was first FDA-approved for abortions in 2000, it had already been in use in France since 1988. (Notably, France enshrined abortion rights in its constitution this week.) Back then, there was already a fair amount of data suggesting the drug, in combination with a medication like misoprostol, effectively ended pregnancies in 95 percent of the people who took it for that purpose. Additionally, its side effects were mild, including nausea and vomiting, dizziness, weakness, abdominal pain, and headache.

Moore participated in the initial effort to get mifepristone FDA-approved for use in the US. “My boss at the time was like, ‘This is it — we finally turned the corner,’” she said. She thought the availability of medication abortion would mean people who wanted to end a pregnancy would be able to get a prescription from their primary care doctor or OB-GYN, pick up the medication from a pharmacy like any other medication, and take it in the comfort and safety of their own home. That meant more than just convenience — it meant people no longer had to subject themselves to the harassment and violence that has long plagued people working and seeking care at abortion clinics and that has worsened in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

But because mifepristone made abortion simpler — and increased privacy and safety for people seeking one — anti-abortion activists saw mifepristone as a huge threat. In the decades since the drug was approved, these activists, and the legislators and justices they lobby and fund, have responded by pushing for a web of regulation aimed at reducing mifepristone access in numerous ways. (In some cases, these restrictions were justified with ham-fisted research conducted by anti-abortion researchers who did not always disclose their conflicts of interest; some of this research is now being retracted by the journals that initially published it.)

Reams of data, however, have emerged proving mifepristone’s safety. In 2016, the FDA began loosening some of its restrictions on the drug, raising the gestational age at which it could be used for an abortion from seven to 10 weeks and allowing it to be prescribed by a broader range of health care providers. The changes that allow the drugs to be mailed and now dispensed by retail pharmacies followed in 2021 and 2023.

Anti-abortion activists have continued to push back: After the 2023 FDA rule change, 20 attorneys general from red states wrote a letter to CVS and Walgreens threatening legal action if the chains sold mifepristone by mail, and a Texas judge suspended the FDA’s approval of the drug. That latter decision has been appealed, and the US Supreme Court is expected to hear the case on March 26.

“They’re trying to put the genie back in the bottle and they know they can’t,” says Moore.

The biggest impact of this change may be to increase the number of mifepristone prescribers

The short-term impact of this change will be limited to a few states. Initially, Walgreens will make it available only at a few of its pharmacies in a handful of states where abortion is still legal — New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California, and Illinois — and CVS will dispense the drug only at its pharmacies in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

In states where abortion is illegal, retail pharmacies will still be unable to dispense mifepristone to patients if it’s prescribed to induce an abortion. However, they should be able to dispense the drug for other, off-label uses, at least to the extent they were before the Supreme Court’s decision. Most importantly, patients in these states who are prescribed mifepristone to prevent complications of a miscarriage should now be able to get the drug in retail pharmacies. Many, though, are probably not able to do so: In 2020, only 2.5 percent of women having miscarriages were getting mifepristone from their health care providers — despite 2018 guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It’s unlikely access has improved much since. GenBioPro, the company that produces a generic version of mifepristone, maintains a list of independent pharmacies that stock the drug.

It’s not yet clear how much demand there will be for the drug at retail pharmacies, nor how patients can identify which Walgreens outlets can dispense it for use in an abortion. For now, Moore recommends that people considering an abortion visit I Need an A or Abortion Finder to identify prescribers.

People who favor online ordering might not immediately grasp why a retail pharmacy pick-up may be more convenient than receiving the drug in your mailbox. “Obtaining mifepristone by mail is not a realistic option for some patients,” said Kaye, including unhoused or unstably housed people without permanent mailing addresses, or people who aren’t able to confidentially receive mail at home because they live with a controlling or abusive partner (or just have a nosy family). A pharmacy pickup also makes it possible to take the drug the same day it’s prescribed, rather than wait a few days for it to show up in the mail.

The bigger impact of this change will likely be to increase the number of mifepristone prescribers. Under the old rule, the health care provider “had to be both doctor and pharmacist — meaning they had to pre-purchase the medication and stock it in their clinic in order to hand it over to a patient,” says Moore. Now, although prescribers will still have to get certified to prescribe mifepristone, they won’t also have to deal with everything that dispensing it entails.

That would open the door to many more health care providers — including OB-GYNs and, in many states, primary care providers and other generalists who comfortably prescribe other reproductive health medications like birth control — to provide a fuller spectrum of women’s health care.

Kaye says it’s important for people who favor increased abortion access to give positive feedback to the pharmacies that are helping to do that. “Folks who are opposed to abortion do not stay quiet about their feelings on increased access, and so those of us who believe that patients should have access to all critical medications they need for reproductive health care should make our voices heard,” she says.

Moore also suggests that people who favor increasing abortion access ask their own health care providers to become certified mifepristone prescribers — and, in turn, to ask the pharmacies where they send prescriptions to dispense mifepristone.

Although barriers to mifepristone access remain in many settings, these chains’ decision to expand mifepristone dispensing is “still a really BFD” — a big fucking deal — says Moore. Whatever the caveats, she says, it means major industry players “are saying, ‘We do in fact, think this drug should be treated like other FDA-approved medications. And we’re ready to do that.’”

Update, March 5, 4:35 pm ET: This story was published on March 5 and has been updated to include more information about how few people are prescribed mifepristone for miscarriages."
Feb 29 2024,South Dakota Republican lawmakers want clarity for the state’s abortion laws,KFGO,left,https://kfgo.com/2024/02/29/south-dakota-republican-lawmakers-want-clarity-for-the-states-abortion-laws,"PIERRE, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota’s Republican-controlled Legislature on Thursday approved the creation of a video to outline the state’s abortion laws and to clarify when health care providers are legally allowed to intervene.

The bill passed by the state Senate in a 31-3 vote is also intended for the general public and would require the state Department of Health, which answers to Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, to create the informational video “and other materials” by Sept. 1. Creation of the video would take place in consultation with the state attorney general and legal and medical experts, describing how the state’s abortion laws should be applied.

The bill previously passed in the House by a 63-6 margin, and now heads to Noem.

South Dakota outlaws all abortions except to save the life of the mother under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Republican Rep. Taylor Rehfeldt said she brought the bill for clarity to providers who had questions about when they could intervene to save the life of a mother.

The bill seeks to provide clarification without “the noise of politics around the abortion issue,” Rehfeldt said last week. Efforts to clarify or redefine the statute itself likely would have failed, having little consensus around the issue, she said.

Republican Sen. Erin Tobin told a Senate panel on Wednesday that a video could be used by hospitals and health care systems “to review their policies and to educate all employees” and would be “an actual way to battle misinformation in the state of South Dakota.” The video will be publicly accessible online, she said.

But “there will not be specific (pregnancy complication) circumstances in this video. That’s the problem with health care, is that there are so many different circumstances that you have to allow doctor’s discretion,” Tobin said.

She also said she didn’t know whether the video will have a legal disclaimer.

Sanford Health, a South Dakota-based health care system, asked the panel to support the bill. Senior legislative affairs specialist Ally Brandner said, “At Sanford, we realize that we are entrusted with both the life of the pregnant mother and the child, and we appreciate the sponsor’s efforts to provide clarity around our abortion (laws).”

Noem spokesman Ian Fury, who is the governor’s “unborn child advocate,” said the administration will make the proposed video and materials available on South Dakota’s pregnancy resource website “to make sure that we are offering peace and knowledge to moms, families and the general public and that they can access those resources as well.”

American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota Advocacy Manager Samantha Chapman said the bill “does not solve the fundamental problem that we’re facing here, which is that our underlying statutes are too vague to reasonably inform a medical practitioner as to what they are legally allowed to do in an emergency.”

The video’s budget is expected to be $50,000, but it might cost less, Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt told the Senate panel.

A proposed ballot initiative would place abortion rights in South Dakota’s constitution. The Legislature inked its official opposition to the measure earlier this month with a resolution against it.

Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba said the video bill would open the state to litigation for attempting to influence the measure’s election outcome."
Mar 07 2024,"Alabama Gov. Defies Anti-Abortion Groups to Sign IVF Bill, But IVF's Future Remains Murky",Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/alabama-gov-defies-anti-abortion-groups-to-sign-ivf-bill-but-ivfs-future-remains-murky,"Late Wednesday night, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) signed a bill to offer criminal and civil legal protections to fertility clinics that offer IVF services, a few hours after it passed out of the legislature across bipartisan lines. The bill comes as reproductive services in the state have descended into chaos following a ruling from the state Supreme Court in February, which declared frozen embryos to be “extrauterine children” eligible for wrongful death lawsuits. This ruling, which came after three Alabama couples sued a clinic for wrongful death after their embryos were accidentally destroyed, prompted several fertility clinics in the state to pause IVF services to avoid the threat of costly lawsuits.

In a statement, Ivey said she’s “pleased to sign this important, short-term measure into law so that couples in Alabama hoping and praying to be parents can grow their families through IVF,” adding that the bill reflects that “Alabama works to foster a culture of life, and that certainly includes IVF.” To be clear, Ivey has supported the policies that directly brought us to the Alabama Supreme Court ruling, including her staunch policy position that “life begins at conception,” and her signing total abortion bans in 2019 and 2023.

By signing the bill, Ivey is still defying sharp opposition from top anti-abortion groups. In a Monday letter (prior to the bill’s passage) addressed to Ivey, a coalition of top anti-abortion activists working with Live Action, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Students for Life, March for Life, and Eagle Forum urged Ivey to veto the bill. (These groups have previously endorsed Ivey, who’s proudly touted their endorsements.) They argued that “this sweeping legislation would slam the door on any protections for the most vulnerable Alabamians,” ostensibly referring to embryos, and “prevent families from seeking justice for the death or harm caused to their children, and leave a trail of destructive, immoral implications in its wake.” Toward the end of the letter, the activists make the frankly terrifying statement that “IVF is not a morally neutral issue” and that it “would be a grave mistake to rush through any legislation without seriously considering the … very real consequences of leaving a procedure as consequential as creating human life unregulated.”

In other words, leading anti-abortion groups stand with the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling that accords embryos with legal personhood, effectively bans IVF, and leaves pregnant people vulnerable to wrongful death lawsuits or even criminal charges for pregnancy loss. The letter further lies that “it is an indisputable scientific fact that human life begins at the moment of fertilization” and refers to an embryo as “a child in the embryonic stage of development” (lol), who should “be accorded the same human rights and level of dignity that all other human beings…are granted.” The terrifying letter ultimately throws out a crumb of sympathy for families with fertility struggles who have been left in a devastating limbo by the ruling but maintains its position: “While we understand and share the legislators’ concern for families struggling with infertility, this [bill] will ultimately harm these families and jeopardize the lives of precious children.”

Alabama Republicans’ support for the pro-IVF bill is, if anything, an outlier among the party. On Tuesday, Tennessee Republicans blocked a bill to codify IVF and birth control protections from even coming out of committee because they argued it would weaken and limit the state’s total abortion ban. Last week, U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to codify similar IVF protections on the federal level for a second time in a row.

While IVF is front-and-center right now thanks to the Alabama Supreme Court, anti-abortion activists have long planned to target it as part of a broader agenda to control the full range of reproductive decision-making and accord embryos with personhood. In 2022, leaked audio showed anti-abortion activists advising Tennessee Republicans to wait for the right time to inevitably pick up their attacks on birth control and IVF. And, if Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America’s letter to Gov. Ivey this week shows anything, it’s that anti-abortion activists are just as determined to target IVF today.

Alabama lawmakers and Ivey seem to be in agreement that their new IVF law is a short-term solution of sorts to a long-term legal question. Just as Ivey called the law a “short-term measure,” other lawmakers acknowledged to CNN that their bill is a “temporary fix.” Even though at least two clinics said they plan to resume IVF services, at least one clinic, as well as legal experts and fertility advocates in the state say they lack confidence in the bill. Most notably, the “short-term” bill doesn’t address the 2018 state Constitutional amendment that the state Supreme Court cited to recognize embryos as children.

Barbara Collura, president and CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association told Jezebel in a statement that the legislation passed Wednesday “does not address the underlying issue of the status of embryos as part of the IVF process—threatening the long-term standard of care for IVF patients.” In a statement about the bill, The Center for Reproductive Medicine at Mobile Infirmary said that it won’t resume IVF “until we have legal clarification on the extent of immunity provided by the new Alabama law.” And the American Society for Reproductive Medicine similarly said the legislation “will not provide the assurances Alabama’s fertility physicians need to be confident they can continue to provide the best standard of care to their patients without putting themselves, their colleagues, and their patients at legal risk.”

“There is a lot of ambiguity in the language of the Republican bills that if I was advising a clinic, would give me great pause before resuming treatment,” Katherine Kraschel, an assistant professor at Northeastern University School of Law, told CNN this week.

All told it seems no one’s especially thrilled with this piece of legislation except the Republican lawmakers patting themselves on the back. Anti-abortion groups are pissed, fertility clinics seem hesitant to resume IVF, and, consequently, IVF patients remain left without answers."
Mar 01 2024,Montana Court Blocks 3 Anti-Abortion Laws in Important Red State Win - Jezebel,Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/montana-court-blocks-3-anti-abortion-laws-in-important-red-state-win,"A Montana court has blocked three anti-abortion laws from taking effect, which would have banned abortion at 20 weeks, prohibited doctors from prescribing medication abortion through telehealth, required 24-hour waiting periods to have medication abortions, and required ultrasounds to be performed prior to an abortion. These laws were originally passed and signed into law by Montana’s Republican-majority legislature in 2021 but were temporarily blocked by a court injunction in October of that year.

District Court Judge Kurt Krueger wrote on Thursday that the laws in question imposed a significant burden on abortion access while also infringing on women’s state Constitutional right to access abortion prior to fetal viability, as established by a Montana Supreme Court ruling from 1999. Thursday’s ruling further specifies that “fetal viability” isn’t an arbitrary gestational marker, but something that should be determined by medical professionals rather than the state. “Courts are particularly wary of ideological or sectarian legislation presented as healthcare interests,” the ruling says.

In the state of Montana’s arguments in favor of the bogus slate of medically unnecessary, wholly political laws, the state claimed that the 1999 state Supreme Court ruling in question had been wrongly decided. The state now plans to appeal Krueger’s ruling to “[protect] the health and safety of women and unborn babies in Montana” (lol), but the 1999 ruling has been protecting pregnant people in a state otherwise governed largely by anti-abortion extremists from abortion bans for some time now, so good luck to the attorney general’s office, I guess!

“We are relieved that Montanans will no longer live with the threat of these harmful restrictions taking effect,” Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montana, said in a statement in response to Krueger’s ruling. Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, also said the ruling marked an important “win to fight for equitable abortion access in Montana and beyond.” Of course, while Montana residents won’t have to contend with an abortion ban at this time, there are still significant barriers to abortion access: 93% of counties in the state lack an abortion provider. Advocates are also currently challenging a 2023 law that would ban the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure (which is the most common procedure for abortions after 15 weeks) if a court allows it to take effect.

The ruling to block these abortion laws also comes after Montana voters rejected an insidious anti-abortion ballot measure in November 2022, which threatened doctors with criminal charges for failing to provide “life-saving care” to the newborn—even when no amount of action from doctors could realistically keep the baby alive, and families just want to be with their dying infant in its final moments. Despite the measure’s wildly deceptive framing, Montana voters still defeated it in an important testament to the fact that even ostensibly “red” states oppose abortion bans and state attacks on bodily autonomy."

But “there will not be specific (pregnancy complication) circumstances in this video. That’s the problem with health care, is that there are so many different circumstances that you have to allow doctors discretion,” Tobin said.

She also said she didn’t know whether the video will have a legal disclaimer.

Sanford Health, a South Dakota-based health care system, asked the panel to support the bill. Senior legislative affairs specialist Ally Brandner said, “At Sanford, we realize that we are entrusted with both the life of the pregnant mother and the child, and we appreciate the sponsor’s efforts to provide clarity around our abortion (laws).”

Noem spokesman Ian Fury, who is the governor’s “unborn child advocate,” said the administration will make the proposed video and materials available on South Dakota’s pregnancy resource website “to make sure that we are offering peace and knowledge to moms, families and the general public and that they can access those resources as well.”

American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota Advocacy Manager Samantha Chapman said the bill “does not solve the fundamental problem that we’re facing here, which is that our underlying statutes are too vague to reasonably inform a medical practitioner as to what they are legally allowed to do in an emergency.”

The video’s budget is expected to be $50,000, but it might cost less, Health Secretary Melissa Magstadt told the Senate panel.

A proposed ballot initiative would place abortion rights in South Dakota’s constitution. The Legislature inked its official opposition to the measure earlier this month with a resolution against it.

Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba said the video bill would open the state to litigation for attempting to influence the measure’s election outcome."

Feb 26 2024,This ballot measure would restore Roe. Abortion rights groups are attacking it.,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/24078960/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-measure-dobbs,"On the same day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a law banning nearly all abortions in South Dakota took effect. This so-called trigger law was passed by South Dakota lawmakers in 2005 and immediately became one of the strictest bans in the nation, with no exceptions even for rape or incest.

Now a South Dakota ballot measure to “restore Roe v. Wade” is moving forward, despite opposition not just from Republican lawmakers and anti-abortion advocacy groups, but also from some local reproductive rights activists and national progressive organizations who say it doesn’t go far enough.

The pushback from certain corners of the political left illustrates ideological and strategic fissures within the abortion rights movement that have intensified since the fall of Roe, and leave ballot measure organizers in South Dakota to push ahead alone.

The proposed measure would amend South Dakota’s constitution to effectively codify the access available under the original Roe v. Wade decision. It would prevent the state from regulating abortion in the first trimester (weeks 1 to 13 of pregnancy); during the second trimester (14 to 26 weeks) the state could regulate it “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” Beyond that point, after a fetus is viable, South Dakota could regulate or prohibit abortion, except when a doctor deems the procedure necessary to preserve their patient’s “life and health.”

The vast majority of abortions in the United States occur during the first trimester. In 2020, 93 percent occurred before 13 weeks, according to the CDC, with an additional 6 percent occurring between 14 and 20 weeks.

Though South Dakota is a solidly conservative state, voters have rejected near-total abortion bans on ballot measures twice before — in 2006 and 2008 — and in the last decade, activists have won progressive voter referendums on other issues, including campaign finance, payday lending, medical and recreational cannabis, and most recently, Medicaid expansion.

To get on the November ballot, organizers will need to submit at least 35,017 valid petition signatures by May 7. Signatures are being collected by a grassroots group — Dakotans for Health — which also helped lead the ballot measure campaign for Medicaid expansion in 2022.

“We’re on track and feeling very bullish,” Adam Weiland, a leader with Dakotans for Health, told Vox. “We’ve got well over 50,000 signatures signed, sealed, and delivered, but we’re still collecting because we know they’re going to throw the kitchen sink at us.”

Despite the optimism, advocates face hurdles from the left and right. In the Republican-dominated state legislature, more than 90 state senators voted for a resolution opposing the constitutional amendment, and last week House lawmakers voted to allow people to remove their signatures from the ballot-measure petition. (Dakotans for Health has threatened to sue over this.) The prime sponsor of the signature withdrawal bill has been insisting the proposed amendment is far more extreme than Roe v. Wade.

Meanwhile on the left, some abortion rights groups have started openly attacking the ballot measure and the organizers behind it. The ACLU of South Dakota, and Planned Parenthood North Central States — which represents Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota —have both raised issues with its drafting and its final language, saying they do not believe it will “adequately reinstate” the right to abortion.

Amy Kelley, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Sioux Falls, is supporting the ballot measure because she said practicing health care is untenable for physicians like her under the trigger ban, and she doesn’t want perfect to be the enemy of good.

“Of course it would be better to have a bill like the one that died in committee that said abortion is health care and should be left to women and doctors, but are we going to get to that in South Dakota before we have a maternal mortality crisis? Probably not,” Kelley told Vox. “The measure is not enough but does that mean that we don’t go in the right direction just because it’s not exactly what we want?”

Who is allowed to lead the defense of reproductive choice?

When the draft opinion of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision was leaked in May 2022, Cathy Piersol, a retired Sioux Falls attorney and a longtime advocate for women’s rights, called her friend Jan Nicolay, a former Republican lawmaker who led the campaigns against the 2006 and 2008 abortion ban ballot measures. They knew the trigger ban would take effect if Roe was officially overturned.

The women started convening meetings, including with representatives from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU. Piersol and Nicolay wanted to submit ballot language to codify abortion rights in South Dakota’s constitution, quickly, before South Dakotans elected a new secretary of state in November 2022. The favored candidate for secretary of state had repeatedly refused to affirm the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s election win in 2020 and was proudly touting an endorsement from South Dakota Right to Life.

But some activists felt things were moving too fast and that leaders should conduct more research and polling before advancing any specific ballot measure draft. Given the high likelihood that they’d face legal challenge, these advocates felt more due diligence was needed.

Others involved disagreed. They pointed to the prior ballot measure successes led by the South Dakota Campaign for Healthy Families, which Nicolay had directed.

“The idea that this was a rushed job is just silly; it’s simply not accurate,” Piersol told Vox. “We knew if we didn’t get a constitutional amendment quickly then the legislature would fiddle, diddle, and mess up the entire thing.” Piersol said she asked a Planned Parenthood regional vice president if there was a plan, “and he said, ‘Well, no, not right now,’ and I knew then we were on our own. It’s daunting but you cannot let yourself be dragged by the nay-sayers.”

Nicolay and Piersol approached Dakotans for Health with questions about executing a ballot measure campaign, and the group offered to organize the effort. Rick Weiland, founder of Dakotans for Health and a longtime political operative in the state, said he personally called the local ACLU and Planned Parenthood affiliates multiple times and was ignored. “[We’re] hoping that once we qualify for the ballot there will be a change of heart,” he told Vox.

About five months later, activists were approved to officially start collecting signatures, and for more than a year into the petition drive, local and national reproductive rights groups stayed relatively quiet. When I covered the pending ballot measure campaigns for abortion rights in summer 2023, Planned Parenthood North Central States had not issued any public statement and did not return my multiple requests for comment.

More recently, some activists started publicly attacking the campaign, most notably in a South Dakota Searchlight article published in early December. Samantha Chapman, advocacy manager for the ACLU of South Dakota, said in the story that her organization is not encouraging people to donate or volunteer, or encouraging people to vote yes or no. She claimed grassroots groups were not consulted and blasted the ballot measure for being initiated by “women who are not of reproductive age.” (Both Nicolay and Pierosol are in their 80s.) Chapman also slammed Dakotans for Health, which she described as “ultimately run by three white men.” (Chapman was formerly married to one of Weiland’s sons.)

Chapman told Vox the national ACLU and her local ACLU affiliate had no further comments for the media.

Nicolay, who is currently in hospice with late-stage pancreatic cancer, told Vox she was deeply offended by Chapman’s remarks. “Quite honestly I was appalled because the gal said, ‘Well, they’re two gray-haired women; they can’t reproduce so we shouldn’t be listening to them,’” she said. “No one has any idea what I went through when I was leading the ballot measures [in 2006 and 2008]. We fought a lot of battles so they could have their rights. We fought them before and we’ll fight them again.”

In the Searchlight article, Tim Stanley, of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said his organization stands with the ACLU in opposing the ballot measure. In an emailed statement to Vox, Stanley said they aren’t part of the coalition supporting the abortion rights amendment and weren’t involved in drafting it.

“As the sole abortion provider in South Dakota for more than 30 years, Planned Parenthood is acutely aware of the impact policy language can have on patients’ lives,” he said. “Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood North Central States is working to build a future where sexual and reproductive health care is accessible to all South Dakotans, especially people with lower incomes, those in rural areas, LGBTQ+ and other marginalized communities.”

Stanley declined multiple requests to clarify or elaborate on how Planned Parenthood is working to build that more accessible future for South Dakotans.

Kim Floren, who cofounded the South Dakota Justice Empowerment Network, an abortion fund, said she doesn’t think the proposed measure goes far enough and raised concern with certain language, like that it uses the word “women,” which could exclude minors. Chapman pointed to Michigan as a better model for soliciting stakeholder input.

Michigan’s ballot measure, which voters approved in 2022, affirms the right to make decisions about “all matters relating to pregnancy, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, contraception, sterilization, abortion care, miscarriage management, and infertility care.”

Piersol said trying to get the kind of “wonderful and rather elaborate language” that activists pushed for in Michigan is unrealistic. “You’re not going to get that passed in South Dakota,” she told Vox. “We know what people will vote for, and that’s the key.”

Is South Dakota’s measure likely to pass?

Ballot measures protecting abortion rights have won in all seven states in which they’ve appeared since the overturn of Roe, including in red states like Kentucky, Ohio, and Montana. Some of the victories were very expensive to win, with activists raising tens of millions of dollars for the efforts in Michigan and Ohio.

Organizers in South Dakota are preparing for the likelihood that they may see virtually no outside fundraising assistance, as national progressive funders like Open Society Foundations and the Fairness Project, and national abortion rights groups like Reproductive Freedom for All and Planned Parenthood, have already made clear they plan to stay out of the campaign. Funders recently told Politico they see South Dakota’s measure as having “shortcomings” and not “align[ed] with our values.”

Adam Weiland said an advantage is that South Dakota does not have a pricey media market, and so he believes they can still win without national donors, as they did with Medicaid expansion. “We’re a small state and we’ve already raised upwards of a million dollars,” he told Vox. “We think we’ll need 2, 3, or 4 million to win.”

In some respects, it might ultimately help that big progressive groups that heavily fund Democratic-aligned causes want to sit South Dakota out. One key way activists have been able to win over conservatives in other states is by ensuring their efforts remain aggressively nonpartisan.

Still, activists leading the abortion rights ballot measure campaign in South Dakota don’t see it that way.

“It is so deleterious to women to not have the force of Planned Parenthood and to not have the force of the ACLU behind a program that is specifically set up for women’s safety and health,” said Piersol. “It’s just outrageous that they have taken that position.”

Right now, organizers feel cautiously optimistic about the polling trends. A survey of 500 registered voters sponsored by South Dakota News Watch from July 2022 found 65 percent of respondents supported the idea of a statewide referendum on abortion rights, and more than 75 percent backed legalizing abortion in cases of rape or incest.

However, two more recent polls suggest it still may be a tough battle. In October a survey from the Hill and Emerson College found 45 percent of voters expressing support for South Dakota’s abortion ban, with 39 percent opposed and 16 percent unsure.

A News Watch survey conducted in November found mixed support for the proposed amendment, with 45.6 percent of respondents supporting it, and 43.6 percent opposing it. The poll’s margin of error was 4.5 percent.

Anti-abortion leaders have been cheering the public in-fighting, and SBA Pro-Life America, a national anti-abortion lobbying group, recently highlighted the Emerson College poll as what happens when “a state has a strong pro-life alliance and Planned Parenthood and the ACLU don’t throw millions into advertising.”

Adam Weiland said he’s not too worried about those autumn polls and pointed out that when South Dakotans first started organizing for the 2006 ballot measure to protect abortion rights, surveys showed they were down 14 points.

“Sure, South Dakotans have a more nuanced and moderate view of abortion rights than what some people might have in New York or California, but when you ask them whether or not women or young girls should be forced to carry to term, most people don’t think so,” he said. “Most people believe in the right to a choice.”"

SOUTH DAKOTA GOV. NOEM FILLS 2 LEGISLATIVE SEATS AFTER STATE SUPREME COURT RULING ON CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

South Dakota outlaws all abortions except to save the life of the mother under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade.

If voters approve it, the three-paragraph addition to the South Dakota Constitution would ban the state from regulating abortion in the first trimester and allow regulations for the second trimester ""only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman."" The state could regulate or prohibit third-trimester abortions, ""except when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman’s physician, to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman.""

""We looked at the rights that women had for 50 years under Roe v. Wade, basically took that language and used it in our amendment,"" Weiland said.

Seven states have had abortion-related ballot measures since the Dobbs decision, and voters favored abortion rights in all of them. Four of those -- in California, Michigan, Ohio and Vermont -- enshrined abortion rights in their constitutions.

The South Dakota Legislature's resolution opposing the initiative says the measure ""would severely restrict any future enactment of protections for a pregnant woman, her child, and her healthcare providers,"" and ""would fail to protect human life, would fail to protect a pregnant woman, and would fail to protect the child she bears.""

Republican House Majority Leader Will Mortenson said they approved the resolution to help the public by pointing out ""some of the unintended or intended, maybe, consequences of the measure so that the public could see what it does in practical effect.""

Republican Rep. Jon Hansen — who co-chairs the Life Defense Fund, formed to defeat the initiative — said its language goes too far and ""bans reasonable, commonsense, bipartisan protections that this state has had in place for decades.""

""When Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, we could at least have protections to say if there's going to be an abortion, it needs to be done by a physician, under a physician's supervision, in an inspected facility,"" Hansen said. ""You can't have those protections in the first trimester of this proposed constitutional amendment. That's insane. That's way too extreme.""

Weiland said the language conforms with Roe v. Wade and efforts to say otherwise are misleading and ill-informed.



PRESIDENT BIDEN BLASTS ALABAMA SUPREME COURT RULING ON FROZEN EMBRYOS: 'OUTRAGEOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE'

Democratic House Minority Leader Oren Lesmeister said voters, not lawmakers, should decide. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba also supports the initiative.

The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, however, is not supporting the initiative, telling its supporters in a December email that the language ""isn’t sufficient to restore abortion access in South Dakota.""

The South Dakota House on Tuesday passed a bill by Hansen that would allow signers of initiative petitions to withdraw their signatures. It now goes to the Senate.

Hansen said the bill is about people being misled or ""fraudulently induced"" to sign petitions. Weiland said Hansen's bill is an attack on direct democracy. Hansen said, ""This is a right squarely in the hands of the person who signed; if they want to withdraw, they can withdraw.""

Democratic lawmakers on Thursday brought up concerns about potential abuses and class-action lawsuits over signature removals. They said state laws already exist to ensure ballot initiatives are done properly.

The Senate will soon weigh a House-passed bill that would require the state Department of Health, which answers to Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, to create an informational video, with consultation from the state attorney general and legal and medical experts, describing how the state’s abortion laws should be applied.

Republican Rep. Taylor Rehfeldt said she brought the bill to provide clarification after questions from providers about when they can intervene to save a pregnant woman's life. The purpose is to ""just talk about women's health, what the law says and what the health care and legal professional opinions are, surrounding what our law currently says,"" Rehfeldt said.

Weiland said he is skeptical, not knowing what the video would include.

On Friday, the Senate Republican campaign sent a memo to candidates encouraging them to ""clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government to restrict IVF.""

The GOP arm claimed the Alabama ruling was a way for the Democratic Party to ""manipulate the abortion issue for electoral gain,"" adding that anyone who does not speak out against the ruling would be considered ""political malpractice.""

""There are zero Republican Senate candidates who support efforts to restrict access to fertility treatments,"" the memo stated, according toAxios.

The issue arose last week when Alabama's high court questioned whether a case can be held liable under the Wrongful Death of a Minor Act following an incident where a patient dropped and destroyed the frozen embryos, created using IVF, of several couples in 2020.

The state's Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling that did not consider frozen embryos as unborn babies. Alabama high court justices cited the Sanctity of Unborn Life Amendment, which declares it a ""public policy"" to acknowledge ""the sanctity of unborn life and the rights of unborn children.""

The memo urged GOP candidates to support fertility treatments ""as blessings for those seeking to have children."" Republicans argue that the Alabama ruling to restrict IVF is being used as a Left-wing tactic to push their pro-abortion, anti-family stance.

The GOP also told candidates to see efforts that seek to restrict IVF ""as a defense of family values and individual freedom.""

Former President Trump also spoke on the issue, saying that the Republican Party should always be on the side of the Miracle of Life and that he will always support the availability of fertility treatments such as IVF in every state.

Trump called on Alabama's legislature to quickly find a solution so American families can continue bringing children into this world.

Under my leadership, the Republican Party will always support the creation of strong, thriving, healthy American families. We want to make it easier for mothers and fathers to have babies, not harder! Like the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY of Americans, including the VAST MAJORITY of Republicans, Conservatives, Christians, and Pro-Life Americans, I strongly support the availability of IVF for couples who are trying to have a precious baby… Act quickly to find an immediate solution to preserve the availability of IVF in Alabama. The Republican Party should always be on the side of the Miracle of Life – and the side of Mothers, Fathers, and their Beautiful Babies. IVF is an important part of that, and our Great Republican Party will always be with you in your quest for the ULTIMATE JOY IN LIFE!

Dave McCormick (R-PA), who is running for a seat in the Pennsylvania Senate, said, ""IVF is a ray of hope for millions of Americans seeking the blessing of children. I oppose any effort to restrict it.""

Former Gov. Larry Hogan (R-MD) and Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) also criticized the Alabama court ruling, vowing to protect any efforts to grow a family.

IVF helps give many Americans the chance to experience the joy of parenthood, and government should never stand in the way of that. The Alabama ruling should be overturned. — Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) February 22, 2024

Trump has told advisers and allies that he likes the idea of a 16-week national abortion ban with three exceptions, in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother, according to two people with direct knowledge of Mr. Trump’s deliberations.

Mr. Trump has studiously avoided taking a clear position on restrictions to abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned in the middle of 2022, galvanizing Democrats ahead of the midterm elections that year. He has said in private that he wants to wait until the Republican presidential primary contest is over to publicly discuss his views, because he doesn’t want to risk alienating social conservatives before he has secured the nomination, the two people said.

Mr. Trump has approached abortion transactionally since becoming a candidate in 2015, and his current private discussions reflect that same approach.

One thing Mr. Trump likes about a 16-week federal ban on abortions is that it’s a round number. “Know what I like about 16?” Mr. Trump told one of these people, who was given anonymity to describe a private conversation. “It’s even. It’s four months.”"

South Dakota outlaws all abortions except to save the life of the mother under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade.

If voters approve it, the three-paragraph addition to the South Dakota Constitution would ban the state from regulating abortion in the first trimester and allow regulations for the second trimester “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.” The state could regulate or prohibit third-trimester abortions, “except when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman’s physician, to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman.”

“We looked at the rights that women had for 50 years under Roe v. Wade, basically took that language and used it in our amendment,” Weiland said.

Seven states have had abortion-related ballot measures since the Dobbs decision, and voters favored abortion rights in all of them. Four of those -- in California, Michigan, Ohio and Vermont -- enshrined abortion rights in their constitutions.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE?

The South Dakota Legislature's resolution opposing the initiative says the measure “would severely restrict any future enactment of protections for a pregnant woman, her child, and her healthcare providers,"" and “would fail to protect human life, would fail to protect a pregnant woman, and would fail to protect the child she bears.”

Republican House Majority Leader Will Mortenson said they approved the resolution to help the public by pointing out “some of the unintended or intended, maybe, consequences of the measure so that the public could see what it does in practical effect.”

Republican Rep. Jon Hansen — who co-chairs the Life Defense Fund, formed to defeat the initiative — said its language goes too far and “bans reasonable, commonsense, bipartisan protections that this state has had in place for decades.”

“When Roe v. Wade was the law of the land, we could at least have protections to say if there's going to be an abortion, it needs to be done by a physician, under a physician's supervision, in an inspected facility,” Hansen said. “You can't have those protections in the first trimester of this proposed constitutional amendment. That's insane. That's way too extreme.”

Weiland said the language conforms with Roe v. Wade and efforts to say otherwise are misleading and ill-informed.

Democratic House Minority Leader Oren Lesmeister said voters, not lawmakers, should decide. Democratic Senate Minority Leader Reynold Nesiba also supports the initiative.

The American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota, however, is not supporting the initiative, telling its supporters in a December email that the language ""isn’t sufficient to restore abortion access in South Dakota.”

TRYING TO REMOVE SIGNATURES

The South Dakota House on Tuesday passed a bill by Hansen that would allow signers of initiative petitions to withdraw their signatures. It now goes to the Senate.

Hansen said the bill is about people being misled or “fraudulently induced"" to sign petitions. Weiland said Hansen's bill is an attack on direct democracy. Hansen said, “This is a right squarely in the hands of the person who signed; if they want to withdraw, they can withdraw.”

Democratic lawmakers on Thursday brought up concerns about potential abuses and class-action lawsuits over signature removals. They said state laws already exist to ensure ballot initiatives are done properly.

A VIDEO FOR DOCTORS

The Senate will soon weigh a House-passed bill that would require the state Department of Health, which answers to Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, to create an informational video, with consultation from the state attorney general and legal and medical experts, describing how the state’s abortion laws should be applied.

Republican Rep. Taylor Rehfeldt said she brought the bill to provide clarification after questions from providers about when they can intervene to save a pregnant woman's life. The purpose is to ""just talk about women's health, what the law says and what the health care and legal professional opinions are, surrounding what our law currently says,” Rehfeldt said.

(WKYT) - A new bill filed in the Kentucky Legislature looks to add exceptions for rape and incest to the state’s abortion ban.

Republican Representative Ken Fleming of Louisville filed House Bill 711 on Monday.

Currently, Kentucky’s law only allows abortions if necessary to save a mother’s life or prevent disabling injuries.

The new bill would add exceptions for rape and incest only if the abortion can be performed no later than six weeks after the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period.

The bill would also allow abortions to be performed to remove a dead unborn fetus, an ectopic pregnancy or incomplete miscarriage or in cases of lethal fetal anomaly.

Earlier this year, Senator David Yates, D-Lousivlle, filed “Hadley’s Law,” which would also include exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.

The AG said, ""Idaho's law protects the lives of women and their unborn children, preventing doctors from performing abortions unless necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.""

In August 2022, the Biden administration sued Idaho, pointing to the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), arguing that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by Federal Law to provide emergency care, like abortions, no matter what state law says.

The , , as the case proceeds after .

""Both Idaho law and EMTALA share a consistent goal: to protect everyone's life, including unborn children,"" said AG Raúl Labrador. ""Idaho law is perfectly consistent with EMTALA, which provides explicit protections for 'unborn children' in four separate places. The notion that EMTALA requires doctors to perform abortions is absurd. We are asking the Supreme Court to end the administration's unlawful overreach and to respect the people of Idaho's decision to protect life.""

The opening brief said the ""whole point of Dobbs was to restore to the states their authority to regulate abortion. Yet the administration seeks to thwart Idaho's exercise of self-government on this important topic. The Medicare Act generally—and EMTALA specifically—preserve the right of states to regulate the practice of medicine, including on the issue of abortion.""

Jan 05 2024,Supreme Court Rules Red State Abortion Ban Can Stay In Effect,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2024/01/05/supreme-court-rules-red-state-abortion-ban-stay-effect,"The Supreme Court ruled Friday that Idaho’s abortion ban could remain in effect and agreed to take up the case in April.

The request for a stay came from Republican Attorney General Raúl Labrador, who filed a petition with Justice Elena Kagan on Nov. 26 asking her to overturn a lower court’s decision to bar the state from enforcing its law. Kagan wrote in the order that the request for a stay had been granted until the court heard the case in April. (RELATED: ‘A Cynical Strategy’: Less Than Two Years After Dobbs, Abortion Is Headed To The Supreme Court Again)

“The preliminary injunction issued on August 24, 2022, by the United States District Court for the District of Idaho, case No. 1:22-cv-00329, is stayed,” Kagan wrote. “The applications for stay are also treated as petitions for writs of certiorari before judgment, and the petitions are granted on the question presented in Idaho’s application.”

Both parties will have an hour to argue their cases to the court, according to the order.

Idaho’s trigger law banned all abortions after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against Idaho that same year, arguing that the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which prevents hospitals from turning away emergency patients, required doctors to perform abortions and that the state’s law would force doctors to violate a federal statute.

In 2023, the state legislature passed another law that created a limited exception for saving the life of the mother and in cases of rape and incest. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday in a similar lawsuit by the state of Texas that abortion is not mandated in EMTALA and does not override the state’s law.

The Supreme Court also announced in December that it would also take on a case involving the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.

(AP Photo/Morry Gash)

Gov. Tony Evers is likely to veto any abortion limit proposal, but VP Kamala Harris told a Waukesha audience how the bill shows what’s at stake this November.

The contrast in Wisconsin could not have been more clear on Monday’s anniversary of the now-repealed Roe v. Wade. In Madison, Assembly Republicans advanced a bill that could lead to a 14-week abortion ban. In Waukesha County, Vice President Kamala Harris kicked off a nationwide tour, pointing to the proposal as further proof that Wisconsin voters are likely once again to determine a presidential election and with it, the future of women’s healthcare rights.

Speaking at the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades district office in Big Bend, Harris slammed former President Donald Trump for saying he is “proud” of his role in appointing three of the conservative US Supreme Court justices who overturned the 1973 Roe decision in June 2022.

“Proud that women across our nation are suffering?” said Harris. “Proud that women have been robbed of a fundamental freedom? That doctors could be thrown in prison for caring for patients? That young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers? How dare he?”

Since becoming vice president, Harris has made five appearances in Wisconsin—a key state that is wrestling with a key campaign issue with national implications. Prior to her speech, Harris met privately with health care providers and families that have been affected by the legal back-and-forth over Wisconsin’s abortion restrictions.

Harris also called out Wisconsin Republicans who on Monday held a hearing in the state Capitol on a bill that would create a binding statewide referendum on whether abortion should be banned after 14 weeks of pregnancy. Harris called the bill’s supporters “extremists” for not including exceptions for victims of rape and incest in the proposed legislation.

The bill’s author, Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie), was asked in Monday’s committee hearing why she did not include rape and incest exceptions, according to reporting by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Nedweski responded that 14 weeks after “probable fertilization” was “enough time” for them to know that they are pregnant and make a decision about the rest of their pregnancy.

Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an obstetrician-gynecologist, told UpNorthNews Radio the language about girls and women being 14 weeks past “probable fertilization” has no basis in medicine.

“There is no medical significance,” Lyerly said, “especially with this ban in particular, because if you read the text, it’s based on post-fertilization age, which is not a medical term. We don’t exactly know with most pregnancies when fertilization occurs, so that introduces ambiguity into what 14 weeks even means.”

Current Wisconsin law bans abortion after fetal viability, usually around 23-24 weeks, which was the standard in Roe before it was struck down.

“We have a strong contingency of legislators here in Wisconsin who want to ban abortion, even for rape and incest. They truly believe that if someone is supposed to die related to a pregnancy, that that’s God’s will. These are the people who are making decisions for us here in Wisconsin right now,” Lyerly said.

Nedweski defended her standard by casting doubt on rape and incest victims who may not know for several weeks that they have been made pregnant by their attacker.

“I’m not going to debate the science of biology here,” Nedweski said, “but as a mother, and having known people who thought they didn’t know they were pregnant, I have a really hard time believing that somebody who doesn’t know they’re pregnant at 14 weeks wants to know. Maybe they just don’t want to know.”

While Assembly Republicans scheduled a hearing on the proposed 14-week ban to coincide with Roe’s 51st anniversary, their bill faces hurdles with fellow conservatives inside and outside the Capitol. State Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg) said last week it would be difficult to get his caucus to coalesce around an abortion bill that Gov. Tony Evers would likely veto. And both Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life oppose the bill and are instead asking an appeals court to rule that an 1849 state law amounts to a full ban on abortion. A Dane County judge has ruled the law does not apply to elective abortions.

Back in Washington, the White House is ratcheting up its focus on abortion rights as a campaign issue. Biden convened a meeting of his reproductive health care access task force to discuss threats to emergency care and new steps for implementing executive orders on the subject. He described Roe as “a fundamental right” that had been “ripped away.”

Days before her Wisconsin appearance, Harris previewed the themes of her speaking tour during a taping of The View on ABC.

“One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling her what to do with her body,” Harris said. “If she chooses, she will talk with her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam. But the government, in this year of our Lord 2024, the government should not be telling women what to do with their bodies.”

Jan 05 2024,Air National Guard commander resigns in protest of Biden's abortion travel policy,The Christian Post,right,https://christianpost.com/news/national-guard-commander-quits-over-biden-abortion-travel-policy.html,"Home News Air National Guard commander resigns in protest of Biden's abortion travel policy

The governor of Arkansas is urging the Biden administration to end its policy of paying the travel expenses of service members who go out-of-state to obtain abortions after a high-ranking military official stepped down from his post in protest.

In a letter sent to President Joe Biden and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin Tuesday, Arkansas’ Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders explained how former Commander of the 188th Wing of the Arkansas Air National Guard Colonel Dillon Patterson resigned from his position on Dec. 18. Her letter elaborated on the reasons for his resignation and pointed the finger directly at a federal government policy.

“Unfortunately, Col. Patterson was forced to personally choose between either continuing his command or adhering to his sincerely held religious beliefs against abortion,” she wrote. “Because he adhered first to his faith instead of overtly political mandates, he voluntarily resigned his command.”

The “overtly political” mandate Sanders was referring to is a Department of Defense policy that involves “using taxpayer dollars to fund the travel, meals, and lodging, associated with out-of-state servicemember travel for procurement of an abortion procedure.” Sanders also noted that “maybe equally as egregious, the DoD now requires that commanding officers — regardless of any sincere and deeply held religious convictions to the contrary — are forced to approve such abortion leave.”

Sanders lamented that Patterson found himself forced to resign because he was “a man of conviction led by senior Department of Defense leadership who had disregarded his service and abandoned his most fundamental constitutional rights in favor of more fashionable political and social experiments.” She concluded her letter by urging the Biden administration to “rescind this policy immediately.”

As Sanders pointed out in her letter, the establishment of the abortion travel policy followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which determined that the U.S. Constitution does not contain a right to abortion. Following the Dobbs ruling, two dozen states, including Arkansas, enacted pro-life protections that either restricted abortion to the first trimester or banned the procedure altogether.

In Arkansas’ case, the state implemented a near-total abortion ban. The pro-life group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America estimates that Arkansas’ pro-life protections will save 3,133 babies from abortion on an annual basis.

The Department of Defense’s abortion travel policy is designed to enable female service members living in states with strong pro-life protections to travel to states that allow abortion through the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. In the October 2022 memo unveiling the policy, Austin insisted it was necessary to assuage concerns about his department’s ability to “recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.”

For her part, Sanders insisted that the Biden administration's abortion travel policy is one of the factor's hindering the Department of Defense’s ability to “recruit, retain, and maintain the readiness of a highly qualified force.”

Sanders added: “At a time when nearly every military branch has failed to meet recruiting thresholds, it is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible and short-sighted bureaucratic mandate. As relevant here, nationally, the Air National Guard missed its most recent recruiting goals by a shocking 40%.”

Sanders isn't the only Republican elected official to call on the Pentagon to abandon its abortion travel policy. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., held up military promotions for nine months in protest of the policy and continues to block high-ranking appointments.

In a 221-213 vote last summer, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved an amendment to the Department of Defense’s funding bill for fiscal year 2024 that would nullify the policy. However, the amendment did not make it into the final version of the bill after going through the Democrat-controlled Senate and reaching Biden’s desk.

In addition to the Pentagon policy of paying the travel expenses for female service members seeking to obtain abortions out of state, the Biden administration has authorized the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to perform abortions at hospitals maintained by the government agency in cases where a “health care professional” determines that “the life or the health of the pregnant veteran would be endangered if the pregnancy were carried to term or the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.”

The VA's policy has the effect of circumventing statewide bans on abortions by allowing hospitals in states with such laws to perform the procedure in some cases.

Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., insisted that performing abortions at the VA ran afoul of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 that authorizes VA hospitals to provide “general reproductive healthcare” specifically excluding abortions, but the Biden administration implemented the policy anyway."

Dec 13 2023,Cruz's Silence on Texas Abortion Case is an Act of Cowardice,Boing Boing,left,https://boingboing.net/2023/12/13/cancun-cruz-silent-on-crucial-abortion-issue.html,"Sanctimonious Canadian blowhard Ted Cruz is not one to shun the spotlight and trumpet views manufactured to please his voters, unless it's to escape an electric power shutdown of his own policies' making by vacationing in Cancun while his constituents freeze. But the nauseatingly garrulous poltroon has zipped his mustachioed lip tight on the issue of Kate Cox, the Texas woman who had to leave Texas to receive a medically necessary abortion.

From Vanity Fair:

Cruz was asked three separate times on Tuesday to weigh in on the matter but refused to do so, telling NBC News to speak to his press office, which didn't respond to a request for comment. When asked again on Wednesday, the Texas lawmaker again refused. Cruz has never previously been shy about discussing reproductive matters. Before Roe v. Wade was overturned, he was the lead sponsor of a bill that would have banned the procedure after 20 weeks nationwide.

The Supreme Court agreed on Wednesday to take up a case about the drug regimen responsible for more than half of the nation’s abortions.

At the request of the Biden administration and the manufacturer of mifepristone Danco Laboratories, the highest court in the land will determine whether to let stand a ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found the Food and Drug Administration likely violated U.S. law when it approved the pill for mail order.

For more than two decades, pro-life doctors repeatedly asked the FDA to repeal its approval of chemical abortion drugs because “the agency violated federal laws by approving these drugs and ignoring the substantial evidence that these drugs harm women and girls.” Despite the FDA’s legal obligation to address these concerns, the agency repeatedly stonewalled petitioners’ requests for years.

Last year, Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of five pro-life medical associations and institutions, along with doctors Shaun Jester, Regina Frost-Clark, Tyler Johnson, and George Delgado formally alleged in a federal lawsuit that the FDA wrongfully used accelerated drug approval authority to fast-track abortion pills that can cause dangerous and sometimes fatal complications.

A few months later, the FDA quietly modified its regulation to accommodate the White House’s abortion activism so pharmacies could become abortion pill dispensaries. Before that, mifepristone could only be obtained via abortion facility, doctor, or mail order, a lockdown-era provision the Biden administration made permanent in 2021. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court declined to evaluate the FDA’s initial approval of mifepristone but agreed to hear arguments about its mail-order authorization.

“As a practicing OB-GYN with over 30 years of experience, I have seen first-hand what the abortion pill regimen has done to my patients, both mother and child. As many as one in five women will suffer a complication such as hemorrhage or infection, and I have cared for many of these women in the ER,” Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs at Charlotte Lozier Institute, said in a statement. “The Biden administration’s decision to weaken commonsense safeguards and remove doctors from the process shows they prioritize abortion on demand over the mother’s safety.”

More than two decades after the FDA rubber-stamped the abortion pill, Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk stayed their actions in April, claiming the FDA chose politics over safety to advance abortion pills.

The Supreme Court allowed the continued dissemination of abortion pills while the legal fight continued. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also allowed the FDA pill approval to stand but said the pills should not be prescribed via telemedicine or mail. That decision will now be reviewed by the Supreme Court.

“Every court so far has agreed that the FDA acted unlawfully in removing common-sense safeguards for women and authorizing dangerous mail-order abortions. We urge the Supreme Court to do the same,” Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Erin Hawley, vice president of the Center for Life and Regulatory Practice, said in a statement.

The FDA’s 2000 endorsement of the abortion pills, Hawley said, “has harmed the health of women and undermined the rule of law by illegally removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen.”

“Like any federal agency, the FDA must rationally explain its decisions. Yet its removal of common-sense safeguards—like a doctor’s visit before women are prescribed chemical abortion drugs—does not reflect scientific judgment but rather a politically driven decision to push a dangerous drug regimen,” she concluded.

Dec 12 2023,Texas Supreme Court blocks special abortion case,WBUR,center,https://wbur.org/hereandnow/2023/12/12/texas-supreme-court-abortion,"When Kate Cox’s fetus was diagnosed with a condition that is almost always fatal, she sued her home state of Texas for an emergency abortion. A state judge ruled that she could terminate her pregnancy because continuing it pregnancy could have harmed Cox’s health and fertility.

But the Texas Supreme Court placed that decision on hold. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled against her, upholding the state’s near-total abortion ban. It’s not the first instance of an emergency abortion being denied in Texas.

“Texas is really focused on making it as difficult as possible for someone to be able to terminate a pregnancy,” says Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School.

5 questions with Kimberly Mutcherson

What are the exceptions to Texas’s near-total abortion ban that would allow someone to terminate a pregnancy?

“You have to have to specifically say that this is life-threatening. You have to specifically say that you are making this diagnosis under your reasonable medical judgment. You have to specifically say what the risks are.

“If you don't do that, then they say the exception can't apply.”

Why didn’t Cox’s case fall under that statute, according to the ruling?

“The language of the statute is very specific. It requires that the physician has to say, in her reasonable medical judgment, that there is a life-threatening physical condition — It's very clear that it has to be a physical condition — that's aggravated by or caused by or is arising from the pregnancy. And it places the pregnant person at risk of death or it poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the person gets an abortion.

“What the Texas Supreme Court says is the language that was used both by … the physician and by the judge [of the lower court] doesn't track the language of the statute.

“It doesn't use that sort of magic language.”

Have there been any abortions in Texas after the overturning of Roe v. Wade?

“There have been abortions in Texas post-Dobbs.

“The legislature didn't do a very good job of helping people understand just how broad or narrow the exception is. So one of the other things that the Supreme Court did that hopefully will be useful for physicians and for pregnant patients in Texas is they said it doesn't require imminence. So it doesn't have to be, you know, you're right at death's door before you can get that abortion.

“They also said that it doesn't require a court order. So all of those things should put physicians in a better position in determining whether there's a medical exception.”

If the exception doesn’t require a court order to perform an abortion, how do patients and physicians end up in court?

“You come to court because you don't trust, right? You don't trust Ken Paxton, the state attorney general.

“You don't trust how the medical exemption is going to be interpreted. If you do end up in criminal court and you're facing losing your medical license or going to prison for decades, you want to be pretty sure that you're not gonna be successfully prosecuted.

“So the Texas Supreme Court says you don't need to get a court order, but if you want to really be safe, going to court and getting a court order is what you would do.”

What are the implications for hospitals and physicians going forward after the Kate Cox case?

“I think it's very clear that Ken Paxton, his preference is for not a single abortion to happen in the state of Texas. It's really important also to remember here that even though we've talked a lot about the fetal anomaly and that's why this discussion about abortion started, that is that in and of itself is not a reason to have an abortion in Texas.

“It doesn't matter if you're gonna have psychological harm. Doesn't matter if you have mental health issues. It doesn't matter if you're going to spend 20 weeks of your pregnancy carrying a fetus you know is not gonna survive. None of that matters. It has to be that you have a life-threatening physical condition.”

Dec 12 2023,Sen. Blackburn: Report of $2B for Abortion Providers 'Appalling',Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/politics/gao-marsha-blackburn-planned-parenthood/2023/12/12/id/1145647,"According to a new study from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, nearly $2 billion in taxpayer money went to major abortion providers from 2019 to 2021, a figure that Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., called ""appalling.""

The study was released Tuesday after a request from Blackburn and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., and shows that Planned Parenthood got $1.78 billion, including $90.4 million from the pandemic-related Paycheck Protection Program.

""It is appalling that big abortion providers are continuing to receive billions of dollars in federal taxpayer funding,"" Blackburn said. ""While small businesses struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic, Planned Parenthood illegally siphoned over $90 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, specifically designed to help our mom-and-pop shops keep their doors open.""

Americans, she added, ""want their tax dollars spent responsibly and in line with our nation's values — not on the left's abortion-on-demand agenda. I will never stop fighting to protect the unborn and end taxpayer-funded support for the abortion industry.""

According to the report:

Health Centers received about $21.69 billion in Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grants. The centers, which may be eligible for grants administered by HHS' Health Resources and Services Administration, also received about $53.12 billion in payments including Medicare (for persons aged 65 and over, individuals with disabilities, and individuals with end-stage renal disease), Medicaid (for certain low-income and medically needy individuals), and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP—for certain uninsured, low-income children). As of May 2023, 1,150 Health Centers had received an estimated $2.47 billion in Paycheck Protection Program loans. Of that, $2.45 billion, including accrued interest on these loans, has been forgiven.

Planned Parenthood Federation of America affiliates got $148 million in HHS grants or cooperative agreements and $1.54 billion in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payments. Affiliates also received 44 Paycheck Protection Program loans totaling approximately $89 million, with the full amount, including accrued interest, being forgiven.

Four privately owned providers of health-related services in various regions of the United States received about $108 million in Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP payments.

International Planned Parenthood Federation received $2.03 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

MSI Reproductive Choices obtained about $1.35 million from USAID.

""GAO found that Planned Parenthood received a whopping $1.78 billion between 2019-2021 while the nation was struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Smith, who co-chairs the House Pro-Life Caucus. ""Federal taxpayer dollars should not be funneled to big abortion corporations like Planned Parenthood, which has killed over 9.3 million unborn children since 1970, including 1.11 million between 2019-2021. This money would have been better spent helping the businesses that were forced to close or providing comprehensive medical support for both women and children.""

Pro-life members of Congress informed the Small Business Administration that Planned Parenthood affiliates, which employ more than 16,000 people nationwide, were not eligible for PPP funding as their corporate office supervised and controlled affiliates and provided considerable funding and support.

The Trump administration in 2019 issued Protect Life Rule which was modeled on Blackburn's Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, which requires those who receive Title X funding to agree not to refer for abortion and to maintain physical and financial separation from abortion providers.

Title X was Planned Parenthood's second largest source of federal funding during former President Barack Obama's administration. While former President Donald Trump was in office, the organization forfeited the Title X funding, leading ""almost all affiliates to discontinue using family planning grants"" under that source in 2020 and 2021, according to the GAO."

Dec 11 2023,MO Bills Allow Murder Charge For Having An Abortion,JoeMyGod,left,https://joemygod.com/2023/12/mo-bills-allow-murder-charge-for-having-an-abortion,"The Kansas City Star reports:

Missouri Republican lawmakers are pushing a pair of bills that would allow for women to be charged with murder for getting an abortion in the state. The proposed legislation would give fetuses the same rights as human beings, which would allow for criminal charges to be filed against anyone who gets an abortion, helps someone get an abortion or provides abortion care in the state, which implemented a near-total ban on the procedure after last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Sen. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, and Rep. Bob Titus, R-Billings, pre-filed the bills ahead of next year’s legislative session, which begins next month. The bills do allow for a “duress” defense if a woman is charged with murder for getting an abortion.

Read the full article. Missouri is one of 27 states with the death penalty and has carried out around two dozen executions in the last decade.

State Rep. Mike Moon recently appeared here for saying that 12-year-olds should be able to marry with parental permission. In February 2023, Moon introduced a K-12 “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

Moon first appeared here in 2017 when he slaughtered a chicken on Facebook Live because abortion is bad.

Dec 27 2023,Wyoming woman who torched abortion clinic fined nearly $300K,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/2023/12/27/wyoming-abortion-clinic-arson-fine-lorna-green,"A Wyoming woman who set fire to a planned abortion clinic in the state has been fined nearly $300,000.

A judge on Tuesday ordered Lorna Green, 22, to pay for her destruction of Wellspring Health Access in Casper weeks before it was set to open in 2022. Green’s fire delayed the clinic’s opening by nearly a year.

She must pay $240,000 to Nationwide General Insurance Company, the clinic’s insurer; $33,500 to Christine Lichtenfels, the building’s owner; and $24,500 to Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access.

On May 25, 2022, Green broke into the Wellspring Health Access building, poured lighter fluid on the floor and in aluminum pans and then set everything on fire.

Following a lengthy investigation, Green was finally arrested in March of this year. One month later, the clinic finally opened after repairing the damage she had caused.

In June, Green pleaded guilty to a federal arson charge. She admitted to throwing a rock through a window to break into the under-construction building.

Green was sentenced in September to five years in prison followed by three years of supervised release. While she faced up to 20 years behind bars, she instead received the minimum sentence.

Wellspring Health Access was Wyoming’s second abortion clinic when it opened, but is now the only clinic in the state. Women’s Health and Family Care in Jackson closed earlier this month, citing increased costs.

Wyoming legislators passed a law in March to ban abortion starting over the summer. However, the law was challenged in court and is currently on hold. Wellspring Health Access was one of the organizations that sued to stop the law from taking effect.

Jan 02 2024,Idaho Judge Allows Lawsuit Requesting Clarification On Exemptions To State Abortion Ban,Worthy News,center,https://worthynews.com/92083-idaho-judge-allows-lawsuit-requesting-clarification-on-exemptions-to-state-abortion-ban,"by Karen Faulkner, Worthy News Correspondent

(Worthy News) – An Idaho court has denied a request by the State Attorney General to dismiss a lawsuit filed by several doctors and four formerly pregnant women who are seeking clarification of the exemptions to the state’s broad abortion ban, the Associated Press reports.

State Attorney General Raul Labrador argued there was no need for clarification as the Idaho Supreme Court had already ruled Idaho’s constitution does not provide a fundamental right to abortion.

The four women were each denied an abortion in Idaho although they were informed that their pregnancies were unlikely to go to term, that their fetuses were unlikely to survive birth, and that they were at risk of serious harm through medical complications if their pregnancy continued, AP reports. The women traveled to Oregon or Washington to terminate their pregnancies.

On Friday, 4th District Judge Jason Scott agreed with Labrador that the Idaho Supreme Court had indeed ruled there was no fundamental right to abortion inside the state constitution, AP reports.

However, Scott said, Idaho’s high court had not rejected “every conceivable as applied challenge that might be made in a future case.”

Refusing Labrador’s request to dismiss the lawsuit, Scott said the case should focus only on the circumstances where an abortion would be allowed and whether abortion care in emergency situations applies to Idaho’s state constitutional right to enjoy and defend life and the right to secure safety, AP reports.

Nov 28 2023,Activists Launch Abortion Ballot Initiative in Arkansas,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/28/activists-launch-abortion-ballot-initiative-arkansas,"Activists are working to put abortion on the ballot in Arkansas, adding to a growing list of states that may be voting on the issue in 2024.

A non-profit called For AR People announced the creation of a new group on Monday called Arkansans for Limited Government, a ballot question committee that will support the “Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment.”

RELATED VIDEO — Exclusive: Tuberville Warns GOP Senators Not to Side with Dems on Abortion:

The proposed amendment would “prevent the state from restricting access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception, in cases of rape or incest, in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant female’s life or health,” according to the organization. Abortion is currently completely outlawed in the state except to save the life of the mother.

Samuel Watson with For AR People told local media the non-profit has been working on the initiative since the Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, a 1973 decision that had invented the “right” to abortion.

“We’ve really been working on this since the Dobbs decision came down, and Arkansas’ trigger laws went into effect because we knew immediately what that would mean for patients and providers,” Watson said.

Watson claimed the group is not pro-life or pro-choice, even though the amendment would allow unborn babies — who each have unique DNA at the moment of conception — to be killed in the womb.

“We think that this is a really good compromise language,” he said. “We think that this will cover a lot of ground and really put the decision back into the hands of patients and providers.”

Rose Mimms, executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, said the initiative is concerning and “broad.”

“It’s very broad language, and not letting the state really restrict abortion, any really definitive way which we have many protective laws on the books right now that do protect the mother and the unborn child, and their language has no kind of measures in there at all to protect the women from any complications that she might have that could really cost her really future reproductive health or even protect her life,” Mimms said.

Even so, Mimms said the pro-abortion effort will not stand in the way of the pro-life organization’s main mission.

“Arkansas is going to continue to do what we’ve always done and that is to protect life and to protect mothers and fathers,” Mimms said. “The decision of an abortion is one that carries lifelong consequences and affects the lives of all of us.”

The state attorney general is reviewing the proposed amendment, according to local media. If approved, the group would be allowed to move forward with signature collection.

“According to the Secretary of State’s office, since this is a proposed constitutional amendment, 90,704 signatures would need to be collected to put this on the November 2024 ballot,” the report states.

If the measure makes it onto the ballot in 2024, it would require a simple majority to pass.

Oct 25 2023,Texas counties weigh ‘abortion travel bans’ penalizing people transporting abortion seekers,Staten Island Advance,center,https://silive.com/reckon/2023/10/texas-counties-weigh-abortion-travel-bans-penalizing-people-transporting-abortion-seekers.html,"A roundup of conversations we're having daily on the site. Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.

Lubbock County, Texas Commissioners passed an ordinance on Monday banning transporting another person on their roads for the purpose of getting an abortion.

The decision passed 3-0 and makes Lubbock the largest of three other Texas counties where Republicans have led localized efforts to restrict abortion access and maintain their status as so-called “sanctuary cities for the unborn.”

Private citizens can file lawsuits against people assisting pregnant Texans along some Lubbock County highways under the new ordinance; however, the measure does not prohibit pregnant people from seeking an abortion.

Lubbock contains rural unincorporated communities whose highways connect Texas to New Mexico, where abortion is legal. Abortion seekers in Texas flocked to New Mexico after Texas issued a complete abortion ban with limited exceptions following the fall of Roe v. Wade.

Doctors at the University of New Mexico Center for Reproductive Health have said Texans make up more than 75 percent of their patients and New Mexico’s Planned Parenthoods saw the number of patients getting an abortion nearly quadruple.

In addition to Lubbock County, Republicans in Texas successfully pushed for “travel ban” measures in Mitchell, Goliad and Cochran Counties over the last five years — despite opposition from reproductive rights advocates who pointed out how these ordinances put pregnant people at risk.

Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas spokesperson Autumn Keiser described these pushes as “confusing” and “fear-inducing barriers to essential healthcare” in a statement released Monday. Keiser’s statement was issued the same day that a Trump-appointed federal judge advanced a case accusing three Texas Planned Parenthoods of Medicaid fraud. Planned Parenthoods in Texas are barred from performing abortions under the statewide ban.

Some county commissioners at Monday’s meeting questioned how exactly travel restrictions would be enforced. Councilmember Gilbert Florez, who abstained from voting, criticized the measure for violating women’s rights.

“The ordinance “has many legal problems,” Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish said. “This ordinance, however, does not have a problem with its intent or the intent of those who are passionate about this.”

On Tuesday, Amarillo city council delayed deciding on a similar ordinance during an hours-long public hearing. The council agreed on the need for more input from Amarillo residents before voting on the measure.

Amarillo is the largest city in the panhandle of Texas and, much like some Lubbock County communities, neighbors New Mexico.

“There are things in the ordinance I can’t buy into,” Amarillo Councilmember Tom Scherlen, a “pro-life activist” said. “I have a problem when it comes to neighbors turning neighbors in. That takes me back to World War II, what Nazis did.” Scherlen praised the Supreme Court for turning decisions on abortion access over to states.

“I would certainly entertain an ordinance,” Councilmember Don Tipps said. Both Tipps and Scherlen spoke with Texas Sen. Bryan Hughes prior to Monday’s meeting regarding the ordinances which he authored. Hughes is also the architect of Texas’ six-week abortion ban."

Survey conducted by South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy shows that neither side of the constitutional amendment abortion debate has the majority.

Editor's note: This is the second in a series of stories on a South Dakota News Watch and Chiesman Center for Democracy poll that surveyed 500 South Dakotans on a variety of political topics. Stories will be published weekly through mid-January.

The battle over a proposed 2024 ballot amendment that would enshrine abortion rights in the South Dakota Constitution is not currently getting majority support from either side, according to a statewide poll sponsored by South Dakota News Watch.

The survey of 500 registered voters showed that 45.6% of respondents support the proposed measure, which would supersede a state abortion ban enacted when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. That’s more than the 43.6% who said they oppose the change, but it’s within the poll’s margin of error of 4.5%.

“It’s certainly competitive,” said Rick Weiland, former Democratic U.S. Senate candidate and executive director of Dakotans for Health, a grassroots organization gathering signatures to put the amendment on the November 2024 ballot.

“But I think once South Dakota voters understand that the trigger law they’re living under is one of the most extreme measures in the entire country, these numbers will grow exponentially.”

Rep. Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, who serves as vice president of South Dakota Right to Life and co-chair of the Sioux Falls-based Life Defense Fund, viewed the results as a positive for the anti-abortion movement.

He emphasized the fact that women surveyed in the poll oppose the measure 50.2% to 40.6%, with 9.2% undecided. A majority of men, 51%, said they support the proposed amendment; 36.9% oppose it and 12% are undecided.

“This poll makes clear that the majority of South Dakotans do not support the extreme abortion amendment, including the majority of women who have decided to oppose it,” Hansen said in an emailed statement to News Watch.

Opponents call abortion measure 'extreme'

Mason-Dixon Polling & Strategy conducted the survey Nov. 27-29. Those interviewed were selected randomly from a telephone-matched state voter registration list that included both land line and cellphone numbers. Respondents were representative of all South Dakota counties, ages, gender and political parties. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.5%. South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota sponsored the poll.

The poll question summarized the amendment this way: “During the first trimester it would prevent the state from regulating abortions. During the second trimester, the state could regulate the abortion decision, but any regulation must be reasonably related to the physical health of the mother. During the third trimester, abortion could be prohibited except if it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman, according to her physician.”

Hansen has criticized the wording of the proposed amendment, saying it’s “far more extreme than Roe v. Wade itself.”

Weiland and others pushed back on that statement by saying the amendment uses the same trimester framework as Roe, the landmark 1973 ruling in which the Supreme Court held that the Constitution protected a woman’s right to an abortion prior to the viability of the fetus.

South Dakota under trigger law from 2005

South Dakota is currently under a 2005 state trigger law activated when the Supreme Court left it up to states to determine reproductive rights with its ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

The law makes it a Class 6 felony for anyone “who administers to any pregnant female or prescribes or procures for any pregnant female” a means for an abortion, except to save the life of the mother. South Dakota is one of 14 states whose abortion law does not include exceptions for rape and incest.

Some key takeaways from the News Watch poll:

Party lines: Democrats surveyed support the proposed amendment by a margin of 54.9% to 32.8%, with 12.3% undecided. Republicans oppose by a margin of 52.4% to 36.3%, with 11.3% undecided. For Independents/others, it was 54.6% support, 36.9% oppose, 8.5% undecided.

Age difference: The highest support of the proposed amendment (48.5%) came from the 65-plus age group, while the lowest (43.2%) came from the 50-64 age group. Support from other age groups was 47.6% from 18-34 year-olds and 45.3% from 35-49 year-olds.

Geographical splits: The most support of the proposed amendment came from East River/North (54.5%), followed by Sioux Falls Metro (46.7%), West River (41.3%) and East River/South (40.0%).

Putting abortion on the ballot

The proposed amendment reflects a national trend of progressive groups using the ballot initiative process to gain ground on abortion rights since the Supreme Court rolled back federal protections by overturning Roe v. Wade.

Election wins have come in conservative states such as Ohio, where 57% of voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2023 that ensured access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care.

In Kansas, voters overwhelmingly rejected a 2022 constitutional amendment that would have allowed the Republican-led Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban abortion outright, with 59% voting against the amendment.

Petition efforts are also under way in states such as Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Nebraska to try to put the issue before voters in 2024, a presidential election year in which high turnout is expected.

Dakotans for Health needs to collect a minimum of 35,017 signatures to place the abortion constitutional amendment on the South Dakota ballot. Weiland told News Watch that his group has collected “close to 50,000” signatures as it pursues a goal of 60,000 or more to ensure that ballot access isn’t foiled by invalidated signatures or other technicalities. The deadline to submit signatures is May 7, 2024.

“First you have to make sure that you’ve got something to vote on, which is what we’ve been focused on,” said Weiland. “Then there’s a campaign to educate people in South Dakota about this issue. And we’ve already had conversations with tens of thousands of voters since we started actively circulating our petitions. You know, that’s 50,000 votes in the bank.”

Campaign ignites both sides

The petition drive has galvanized an equally passionate opposition movement, with anti-abortion groups wary of allowing the issue to reach the ballot. South Dakotans rejected near-total abortion bans by statewide vote in 2006 and 2008.

Life Defense Fund demonstrators, as part of their “Decline to Sign” campaign, have occasionally clashed with Dakotans for Health volunteers. Attorney General Marty Jackley sent a letter to Dakotas for Health on Oct. 31 saying that he had received “video and photographic evidence” purporting to show unattended petitions, a violation of state law, and people signing the same petition twice.

Weiland said his group trains petition circulators to follow state law and has addressed any irregularities. He said the larger issue is the harassment his volunteers have experienced at the hands of Life Defense Fund demonstrators.

Dakotans for Health successfully challenged a policy passed by the Minnehaha County Commission that imposed what a judge determined were unreasonable restrictions for petition circulators at the county administration building. A settlement was reached that removed references to a designated area for petition circulators and no longer required circulators to check in with the county auditor before engaging in political activity.

Hansen said his group is committed to campaigning against the measure because of the high-stakes nature of the abortion issue.

“Life Defense Fund works everyday to inform South Dakotans about the actual impacts of the abortion amendment, including legalizing late-term abortion and endangering women by banning safety regulations for most abortions,” Hansen told News Watch. “One thing is clear: the more people learn about the actual impacts of the extreme Abortion Amendment, the more they reject it.”

Poll in 2022: Increase abortion access

In July 2022, News Watch sponsored a Mason-Dixon poll that showed statewide support for making changes to South Dakota’s abortion laws.

That survey showed that a majority (57%) of respondents supported allowing legal access to abortion medications in the state.

More than three-fourths (76%) of those polled support allowing legal abortion in cases of rape and incest, an exception not currently allowed under South Dakota.

The poll also showed that nearly 8 in 10 respondents (79%) oppose criminal penalties for anyone who helps a South Dakota resident obtain an abortion where it is legal, such as in a neighboring state.

Nearly two-thirds (65%) said they supported having a statewide referendum to determine South Dakota’s laws regarding reproductive rights.

“We're offering up something that the people of the United States and South Dakota had for 50 years and was taken away by the Supreme Court,” Weiland said. “When given a choice, we feel like people will overwhelmingly support freedom – more specifically, reproductive freedom in the context of Roe vs. Wade.”"

Jan 06 2024,Supreme Court Allows Idaho Abortion Law To Stay In Effect As Biden Admin Sues,The Daily Wire,right,https://dailywire.com/news/supreme-court-allows-idaho-abortion-law-to-stay-in-effect-as-biden-admin-sues,
Dec 08 2023,Texas AG Moves to Block Court-Approved Abortion,Daily Beast,left,https://thedailybeast.com/texas-ag-ken-paxton-begs-court-to-stop-woman-from-ending-nonviable-pregnancy,"The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a woman from receiving an abortion after a lower court ruled that she could get the procedure in order to protect her own health.

The late Friday ruling came just hours after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the state's Supreme Court to step in and reverse the decision made in favor of 31-year-old Kate Cox, who had sued for the right to terminate a nonviable pregnancy. The strict ban on abortion in the state allows exceptions in cases where the mother is at risk, and Cox’s lawyers cited doctors who said her health and future fertility is in jeopardy.

But Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched a crusade following Cox’s legal victory earlier this week, threatening doctors with prosecution if they provide her with an abortion and reportedly sending a letter threatening legal action to three hospitals he believed could perform the procedure.

Paxton’s office, in a filing with the state’s Supreme Court on Friday, stressed the importance of the fetus’ life, despite a fatal diagnosis.

“Each hour it remains in place is an hour that Plaintiffs believe themselves free to perform and procure an elective abortion,” Paxton’s office wrote. “Nothing can restore the unborn child’s life that will be lost as a result.”

Cox’s lawyers said that in the unlikely event her fetus survives long enough, the baby would likely die a painful death within days of birth.

A judge had sided with Cox on Thursday, issuing a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of the ban in this case. “The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be pregnant, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability, is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” the judge said in explaining her decision, referring to warnings from Cox’s doctors that the doomed pregnancy could affect her future fertility.

The Texas Supreme Court said it was issuing an administrative stay in the case “without regard to the merits” of the arguments put forth on either side to give itself time to review the case and make a decision. The move freezes the lower court ruling allowing Cox to get an abortion and leaves the whole thing in limbo.

Cox had said she hopes to prevent more of “the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy.”

“It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when,” she said in a statement.

“I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy. I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer. I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health and a future pregnancy.”"
Dec 08 2023,Texas AG Threatens to Prosecute Donors for Emergency Abortion,NowThis News,left,https://nowthisnews.com/news/texas-ag-threatens-to-prosecute-donors-for-emergency-abortion,"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is threatening to take legal action against any doctors involved in providing an emergency abortion that received court approval in an historic ruling. Paxton’s statement followed Travis County Judge Maya Guerra Gamble’s December 7 order holding that a 31-year-old woman should be allowed to have an abortion under the limited exceptions to Texas’ ban.

The ruling came in a lawsuit the Center for Reproductive Rights filed on behalf of Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant. Cox, a parent of two hoping for a third child, experienced severe complications during her current pregnancy. The fetus was diagnosed with trisomy 18, or Edwards syndrome, a condition with an extremely low survival rate. Also included as a plaintiff in the lawsuit is Dr. Damla Karsan, the OB/GYN who would perform the abortion.

According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Cox’s doctors informed her that the fetus had ’no chance’ of survival. They warned that not terminating the pregnancy could seriously endanger her health and impact her fertility.

On December 7, Gamble issued a temporary restraining order against the state of Texas and its medical board, holding that Cox could move forward with an emergency abortion.

That same day, Paxton’s office sent a letter to all hospitals where Dr. Karsan has admitting privileges. In the letter, he wrote, ’Your hospital may be liable for negligently credentialing the physician and failing to exercise appropriate professional judgment, among other potential regulatory and civil violations, if you permit Dr. Karsan to perform an unlawful abortion.’

Paxton’s letter claims that the court order doesn’t shield doctors from prosecution under Texas’ abortion laws and that Karsan hasn’t proven Cox's eligibility for medical exceptions to the state’s ban. While Texas’ abortion law does technically allow for medical exemptions, critics argue that the wording is too vague, making it unclear what qualifies.

Jan 05 2024,How a Supreme Court case out of Idaho could reshape abortion law nationwide,Deseret News,center,https://deseret.com/2024/1/5/24027520/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban,"The U.S. Supreme Court is photographed on Friday, Jan. 5, 2024, in Washington. The Supreme Court is allowing Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues.

The Supreme Court on Friday added a second major abortion case to its current term, agreeing to weigh in on a battle over Idaho’s abortion ban.

The law “makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion,” according to The Associated Press. It was set to take effect in August 2022, but that same month, a federal judge limited its application after the Biden administration sued to force changes to the policy.

The administration says that a federal policy called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act should outweigh state abortion bans when a pregnant woman’s life is in danger.

“The Biden administration has argued that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there’s a state law banning abortion,” The Associated Press reported.

Related Supreme Court will hear abortion pill case

Idaho officials, as well as leaders in other conservative states, including Texas, say that the federal policy in question does not mandate abortion access.

“Emphasizing that nothing in EMTALA (the policy) mentions abortion, much less requires hospitals to perform them, the state and the legislature argued that EMTALA was simply enacted to ensure that hospital emergency rooms treat poor or uninsured patients — not to impose a federal standard of care for patients,” SCOTUSblog reported about Idaho’s claims.

On Friday, the Supreme Court did more than agree to hear the dispute. The justices also said that Idaho’s abortion ban could fully take effect while the lawsuit plays out, staying the injunction that has been in place since August 2022.

Last month, the Supreme Court added a separate abortion case to its schedule, as the Deseret News previously reported. In Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the justices will debate whether a pill commonly used to induce abortion can remain widely available across the country.

Both cases arose in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

The Supreme Court will hear the Idaho case in April. A decision is expected by the end of June."

Jan 05 2024,Supreme Court lets Idaho enforce abortion ban for now and agrees to hear case,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban,"Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to let Idaho enforce its near-total ban on abortion in certain emergency medical situations while legal proceedings continue and said it will take up the dispute involving whether the Biden administration can require under federal law hospitals in states that ban abortion to perform the procedure on pregnant patients whose lives are at risk.

The question raised in the case is whether that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, preempts state laws restricting access to abortion. The dispute, between the Biden administration and the state of Idaho, is one of several involving abortion that has arisen following the Supreme Court's landmark decision unwinding the constitutional right to abortion.

The Supreme Court said in a brief order that it would put on hold a lower court ruling that blocked Idaho from enforcing its abortion ban in certain medical emergencies until it issues a decision in the case. Arguments will be heard in its April session.

Enacted in 2020, Idaho's measure makes it a felony for doctors to perform most abortions, with an exception for procedures performed when necessary to save the life of the mother. The law took effect when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, joining so-called trigger bans in more than a dozen states that went into force following the high court's ruling.

In the wake of Roe's reversal, the Justice Department sued Idaho in federal court over the law, arguing that it violates the Constitution and is preempted by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA. The law requires health care providers that receive Medicare funds to provide necessary stabilizing treatment, such as emergency abortion care, to a mother whose health is at risk.

A U.S. district court in Idaho found the state's law conflicts with EMTALA's requirements and blocked it from being enforced for abortions necessary to avoid a ""serious impairment"" to the patient or placing the health of the mother in ""serious jeopardy.""

""We should not forget the one person with the greatest stake in the outcome of this case — the pregnant patient, laying on a gurney in an emergency room facing the terrifying prospect of a pregnancy complication that may claim her life,"" U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote in an August 2022 order imposing a preliminary injunction.

He continued: ""One cannot imagine the anxiety and fear she will experience if her doctors feel hobbled by an Idaho law that does not allow them to provide the medical care necessary to preserve her health and life.""

Winmill said ""it's impossible to comply"" with both EMTALA and Idaho's measure.

A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit granted the Idaho legislature's request to enforce the law while litigation continued. But after reviewing the panel's decision, the full 9th Circuit reinstated the lower court's injunction in October. The appeals court set oral arguments in the case for late January.

Idaho officials sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court in late November, arguing that the federal government can't use EMTALA ""to override in the emergency room state laws about abortion any more than it can use it to override state law on organ transplants or marijuana use.""

The injunction put in place by the district court, they wrote, ""effectively turns EMTALA's protection for the uninsured into a federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply.""

But the Biden administration told the high court that the exception to Idaho's ban is narrower than EMTALA and criminalizes care that is required by federal law, as an emergency room doctor who decides an abortion is necessary to stabilize a patients' condition cannot do so until her condition has deteriorated significantly.

If Idaho's law were allowed to take effect, it ""would cause serious, tangible harms to the United States and to the public,"" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the court in a filing.

""A stay would increase the risk that pregnant patients will face irreversible injuries, such as strokes, amputations, hysterectomies, and organ failure, that could have been prevented with appropriate emergency care,"" she wrote. ""If a stay issues, physicians will be placed in an impossible position, unable to provide 'medically necessary' care and 'put[ting] the health of Idaho women at significant risk.'""

President Biden said in a Friday statement that healthcare decisions should not be made by politicians.

""These bans are also forcing doctors to leave Idaho and other states because of laws that interfere with their ability to care for their patients. This should never happen in America, "" Biden said.

A case similar to Idaho's is proceeding in Texas. A federal district court there sided with the state and blocked the Biden administration from requiring Texas hospitals and doctors to perform abortions in emergency medical situations when it conflicts with the state's law outlawing most abortions.

A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the district court's ruling earlier this month, siding with Texas."

A citizen initiative that aims to restore abortion access to levels seen before Roe V Wade was overturned has officially collected the necessary signatures for placement on the 2024 ballot.

With 910,946 valid signatures, the initiative surpassed the required threshold by nearly 20,000.

“It demonstrated just the incredible support we have across this state to restore our freedoms,” said State Representative Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando).

Eskamani, who worked for Planned Parenthood before running for office, noted the fight is far from over.

The effort still needs to be reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court however, which could decide to block the initiative from the ballot if it deems the ballot language would mislead voters or that the initiative violates the single subject rule.

“This supreme court is conservative, majority appointed by Governor Ron DeSantis. However, the language of this ballot initiative is incredibly clear,” said Eskamani.

But Florida’s Attorney General and supporters of abortion restrictions argue that language is not clear.

Andrew Shrivell with Florida Voice for the Unborn contended the term ‘viability’ in the amendment doesn’t have a clear definition.

“It would legalize abortion up until the moment of birth for just about any reason and there’s pretty much nothing that the legislature or the governor or any of our governmental entities could do to interfere with that so-called super state-charged constitutional right,” said Shirvell.

But Eskamani countered viability is defined in state law and has historically been understood to occur around 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

“And [it] would not allow for there to be an abortion provided to that gestational level. And anyone who says that lying and being disingenuous and trying to use hyperbolic language to scare people from supporting this initiative,” said Eskamani.

The proposal is set for a hearing before the Florida Supreme Court on February 7th.

Dec 07 2023,Texas Judge Weighs Woman's Request for Emergency Abortion,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/us/texas-abortion-emergency/2023/12/07/id/1145103,"A Texas judge Thursday granted a pregnant woman permission to obtain an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to the state's ban that took effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.

It was unclear how quickly or whether Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, will be able to obtain an abortion. State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, said she would grant a temporary restraining order that would allow Cox to have an abortion under what are narrow exceptions to the state's ban. That decision is likely to be appealed by the state.

Cox is 20 weeks pregnant and doctors say her fetus has a fatal diagnosis. In a brief emergency hearing Thursday, her attorneys told Gamble that Cox went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time since her pregnancy.

Cox and her husband both attended the hearing via Zoom but did not address the court. Doctors have told Cox if the baby's heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior cesareans sections, and another C-section at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.

""This law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Gamble said.

The lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox.

Since that landmark ruling, Texas and 12 other states rushed to ban abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy. Opponents have sought to weaken those bans — including an ongoing Texas challenge over whether the state's law is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications — but until now, a woman has not gone to court seeking approval for an immediate abortion.

""I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy or continue to put my body or my mental health through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,"" Cox wrote in an editorial published in The Dallas Morning News. ""I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.""

Although Texas allows exceptions under the ban, doctors and women have argued that the requirements are so vaguely worded that physicians still won't risk providing abortions, lest they face potential criminal charges or lawsuits.

State officials had asked Gamble to deny the request, alleging that Cox does not meet the requirements for an exception to the ban.

""There are no facts pled which demonstrate that Ms. Cox is at any more of a risk, let alone life-threatening, than the countless women who give birth every day with similar medical histories,"" the state wrote.

Cox has been told by doctors that her baby will likely be stillborn or live for a week at most, according to the lawsuit filed in Austin. The suit says doctors told her their ""hands are tied"" under Texas' abortion ban.

The lawsuit was filed a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the ban is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications. That case is among the biggest ongoing challenges to abortion bans in the U.S., although a ruling from the all-Republican court may not come for months.

Cox had cesarean sections with her previous pregnancies. She learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to the lawsuit.

In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions despite their spiraling conditions. A judge later ruled Texas' ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that decision was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.

More than 40 woman have received abortions in Texas since the ban took effect, according to state health figures, none of which have resulted in criminal charges. There were more than 16,000 abortions in Texas in the five months prior to the ban taking effect last year."
Sep 14 2023,Wisconsin abortion doctors & workers preparing for resumption of abortion services,CBS 58,center,https://cbs58.com/news/wisconsin-abortion-doctors-workers-preparing-for-resumption-of-abortion-services,"Wisconsin abortion doctors and workers preparing for resumption of abortion services

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- When Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin resumes providing abortion services Monday, Sept. 18, it will mark a new era because no legal abortions have been performed in Wisconsin for nearly 15 months.

Advocates say that delay has jeopardized the lives of women throughout the state.

Planned Parenthood determined the July 7 decision has given enough clarity to resume providing abortion services. There will likely be further appeals, but for now they're moving forward.

Molly Sisson worked as a patient escort at one of the four clinics in the state that closed when Roe v Wade was overturned.

They said, ""It was definitely something unexpected for us in the space.""

They were hoping the clinics would one day reopen, but Sisson said, ""I think a lot of us were hoping, or expecting, a higher Supreme Court decision to come.""

So when they got a text Thursday morning it came as a surprise.

Rachel Rebouché is the Dean at Temple University's Beasley School of Law and an expert in reproductive health litigation. She said Planned Parenthood no doubt weighed the risk after the July 7 decision.

Rebouché said, ""As of now, a court in the state has said there is no abortion ban.""

Which is why Planned Parenthood doctors will soon resume providing services at two clinics.

Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an OB/Gyn and abortion care provider, said, ""I'll be honest, I do feel a little uncertain, I feel a little uncomfortable. But I trust them.""

Lyerly is talking about her legal team, which will now navigate a likely appeal.

She said, ""I have to count on my team to advise me and let me know when it's safe to do that. That's what they've told me.""

When Governor Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul announced a legal challenge to the 1849 law last summer, Dr. Lyerly was front and center. She told us, ""It's been incredibly confusing for patients, and for physicians.""

For nearly 15 months, the state of Wisconsin has been in a state of legal uncertainty.

Erica Steib protested the end of Roe last summer. On Thursday, she said the resumption of abortion services is encouraging, but a small step. ""I was really thrilled to see that, but two abortion providers in the whole state of Wisconsin is so not enough.""

Lyerly hopes the Sheboygan clinic she worked at will soon join the Milwaukee and Madison clinics in resuming abortion services once staffing and logistical issues are addressed.

She said, ""I bet there's going to be some legal wrangling, I wouldn't be surprised, but I think we are absolutely headed in the right direction, and frankly, I'm staking my career on it.""

But Rebouché said the July opinion is persuasive and ends -for now- months of legal uncertainty rarely seen in the US. ""That's not what we should expect from our state legislatures. That's not what we should expect from our democracies.""

Planned Parenthood is already taking appointments on its website and by phone."

Under current Nevada law, abortion is protected until 24 weeks of pregnancy. Under the proposed constitutional amendment, state legislators would not be able to restrict abortions before fetal viability, as determined by a physician.

After the 23rd week of pregnancy, a baby born prematurely can survive with intensive care.

The effort led by abortion advocates, including Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, will require 103,000 signatures from registered voters by June 26.

If the groups collect the requisite signatures, the question of abortion being codified in the state constitution will be put on the 2024 election ballot — and if that passes in November 2024, then it will appear one more time on the 2026 ballot as amendments “must be passed by voters in two successive general elections before it can be added to the Nevada Constitution.”

If passed, the proposed amendment would prohibit Nevada from “penaliz[ing], prosecut[ing], or tak[ing] adverse action against any individual based on the outcome of a pregnancy of the individual, or against any licensed health care provider who acts consistent with the applicable scope and practice of providing reproductive health care services to an individual who has granted their voluntary consent.”

“Neither may the State penalize, prosecute, or take adverse action against any individual or entity for aiding or assisting another individual in the exercise of the rights established by this initiative,” the amendment continues.

A copy of the proposed amendment was shared with NBC News.

Putting the topic of abortion on the ballot could boost voter turnout, as was the case in the 2022 midterm elections, as many Democrats considered the overturning of the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade to be a major motivation to vote last cycle.

Nevada voted for Biden (50.1%) over Trump (47.7%) in 2020, and in 2022, the state reelected all of its incumbent members of Congress, including a Democratic senator, three Democratic representatives, and one Republican representative.

Republicans and Democrats have been wrestling over their respective abortion agendas nationwide. Florida Democrats are attempting to get a similar abortion measure on the ballot with the hopes of codifying it in the Nevada Constitution.

As state legislatures across the country begin their 2024 sessions, advocates on both sides of the abortion debate said they anticipate ongoing efforts to narrow when emergency abortions can be performed if the mother’s life is in danger.

Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to Idaho officials’ request that it consider overturning a lower court’s ruling that had blocked enforcement of the state law. The Biden administration had sued the state, arguing that Idaho’s statute — permitting abortion only to prevent the death of the mother — violates the standards of the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). The latter requires physicians to provide stabilizing treatment in emergency rooms, which could include abortion, if they “reasonably expect” impairment or dysfunction, or “serious jeopardy to the patient’s health.”"

Once again, American voters in the aftermath of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson decision that last year nullified a woman’s constitutional right to an abortion have told the Republican Party what they think of its crusade to restrict reproductive freedom: Get lost.

On Tuesday, abortion won. In Ohio, 57 percent of the Buckeyes who went to the polls, in an election that saw supercharged turnout, supported a measure to amend the state constitution to guarantee individuals the “right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” (Ohio is the seventh state, including Kansas and Kentucky, to vote in favor of abortion access since Dobbs.) Democratic candidates who championed reproductive rights, including incumbent Gov. Andy Beshear in Kentucky, prevailed. In Virginia, the issue helped Democrats retain the state Senate and gain control of the House of Delegates—a tremendous political blow to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Complaining about GOP losses, former Senator Rick Santorum said “pure democracies are not the way to run a country.”

So what’s the GOP response to this continuous beat-down it is suffering on this front? Minority rule.

After it was clear that a whopping majority of Ohio citizens, despite it being a red state, favored allowing women to make their own choices, the Ohio House speaker, Jason Stephens, a Republican, declared, “I remain steadfastly committed to protecting life, and that commitment is unwavering. The legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life. This is not the end of the conversation.”

In other words: We don’t care what the vast majority of Ohioans want on this deeply personal matter; we will find a way to impose our position—a minority-held view—on everyone.

This is a rather anti-democratic stance. But it’s been at the heart of GOP policy on abortion for decades. While polling on this issue tends to show that Americans hold conflicting beliefs on the subject, the numbers continuously have demonstrated that a majority does not want to ban or severely limit abortion. That is why conservatives and the religious right decades ago adopted a strategy of ending abortion through court decisions.

In the 1970s, the newly-born religious right backed Ronald Reagan and helped elect him president in 1980. In turn, Reagan embraced the movement and the anti-abortion cause. Still, he took few concrete steps to actually stop abortions. He and his crew focused instead on economic matters (tax cuts and deregulation!) and national security, and neglected contentious social issues that might not have majority support. This led leaders of the right to conclude that the abortion battle was best waged in the courts, and they concentrated on seeding the judiciary and the Supreme Court with conservatives who could render decisions that ran counter to public opinion. That effort eventually yielded the Dobbs decision.

Dobbs sparked anger and outrage: Five unelected justices—three of whom were appointed by a president who lost the popular vote—overturned Roe v. Wade and declared abortion was not a protected right under the Constitution. (Talk about judicial activism!) Somehow this decision, decried as an anti-democratic action, encouraged some within the Republican Party and the conservative movement to move toward a more extremist position: barring all abortions without exception. That is close to the view held by the top GOP official in the land: House Speaker Mike Johnson. He has called abortion a “holocaust,” comparing the argument in favor of reproductive rights to Hitler’s philosophy, and he sponsored legislation to ban all abortions after six weeks with no exceptions for rape and incest.

With popular opinion clear on preserving abortion rights, Republicans and anti-abortion advocates obviously still have the opportunity to try to persuade their fellow Americans to change their minds. But many seem intent on dismissing the majority sentiment. Rick Santorum, the former GOP senator and far-right cultural warrior (who likened homosexuality to bestiality and pedophilia), showed us how that’s done when he appeared on Newsmax on Tuesday night to discuss the Ohio results. “You put very sexy things like abortion and marijuana on the ballot, and a lot of young people come out to vote,” he groused. “It was a secret sauce for disaster in Ohio. I don’t know what they were thinking. Thank goodness that most of the states in this country don’t allow you to put everything on the ballot because pure democracies are not the way to run a country.”

Vox populi is not good for the anti-abortion right. The same is true for many Republican policies. This gap between their desired legislation and actual voters feeds a popular talking point on the right: The US is a republic, not a democracy. Speaker Johnson often repeats this mantra in interviews and podcasts; he is fond of quipping that democracy is two wolves and a lamb deciding what’s for dinner. Couple that with his views that America is a “completely amoral society” and that only those who have a “biblical worldview”—meaning they are fundamentalist Christians who believe the Bible is literally true—are worthy candidates for political office, and his math is clear: A righteous (and self-righteous) minority must do what it can to force its truth on the rest.

As election night was turning into a disaster for Republicans and abortion foes, a panel on Fox News accused Democrats of being demagogues on abortion, with host Sean Hannity complaining, “Democrats are trying to scare women into thinking Republicans don’t want abortion legal under any circumstances.”

But many Republicans have indeed passed and proposed measures to prohibit most, if not all, abortions. This is not a question of demagoguery, but democracy.

Ohio Speaker Stephens did not explain what he has in mind to subvert the overwhelming Ohio vote for abortion rights. But he made it obvious that he and his conservative comrades will cook up anti-democratic work-arounds in an attempt to circumvent the popular desire for preserving women’s freedom. It’s a strategy befitting Gilead, and Republicans are fine with that."
Dec 13 2023,Supreme Court to Hear Case That Could Be Devastating to Abortion Activists,Western Journal,not-yet-rated,https://westernjournal.com/supreme-court-hear-case-devastating-abortion-activists,"The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that could deal a devastating blow to the pro-abortion movement.

NBC News reported that the court will take on a case concerning the drug mifepristone, which is used to induce abortions in the early stages of pregnancy.

The Supreme Court will be tasked with deciding whether to uphold a ruling by a lower court in August that the availability of the pill must be restricted.

The case was brought by the Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom against the Food and Drug Administration over its decision to expand access to the drug, including by mail, despite questions about its safety.

“Every court so far has agreed that the FDA acted unlawfully in removing common-sense safeguards for women and authorizing dangerous mail-order abortions,” Erin Hawley, a lawyer for ADF, said in a statement. “We urge the Supreme Court to do the same.”

“The FDA has harmed the health of women and undermined the rule of law by illegally removing every meaningful safeguard from the chemical abortion drug regimen. Like any federal agency, the FDA must rationally explain its decisions,” Hawley continued.

“Yet its removal of common-sense safeguards — like a doctor’s visit before women are prescribed chemical abortion drugs — does not reflect scientific judgment but rather a politically driven decision to push a dangerous drug regimen.”

Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre warned that the previous ruling “threatens to undermine the FDA’s scientific, independent judgment and would reimpose outdated restrictions on access to safe and effective medication abortion.”

“This Administration will continue to stand by FDA’s independent approval and regulation of mifepristone as safe and effective,” Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “No woman should be unable to access the health care that she needs. This should not happen in America, period.”

The drugmaker Danco, which manufactures mifepristone, continues to affirm the “safety and effectiveness” of its pill.

“The FDA actions at issue were well supported by extensive safety and effectiveness data from clinical trials and decades worth of real-world experience in millions of patients,” the company said in a statement.

The legal challenge will be the most important abortion case heard by the Supreme Court since it overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, ending the federal mandate requiring legal abortion and returning the issue to the states.

In a separate decision in April, the court blocked a ruling invalidating the FDA’s approval of mifepristone altogether.

Oral arguments in the latest case are to begin early next year, with a decision expected by the end of June.

Nov 09 2023,Ohio Abortion Decision's Deeper Implications,The Patriot Post,right,https://patriotpost.us/articles/101991-ohio-abortion-decisions-deeper-implications-2023-11-09,"Ohio has counted its votes for the infamous Issue 1, an act that enshrines in the Ohio constitution abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, and Ohioans voted yes. What a tragedy.

In 2020, Ohio went more than eight points for former President Donald Trump. So it’s not exactly a purple state. Yet Tuesday night’s vote wasn’t even close. Pro-life dissenters lost by 12+ points.

Ohio wasn’t the only red-leaning state to have the abortion issue hurt them on election night. Kentucky and Virginia did as well. Well-liked Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin wants to pass a 15-week abortion ban, but Virginians voted blue and flipped the state House and maintained their hold on the state Senate. Deep-red Kentucky reelected Governor Andy Beshear to a second term over his opponent, Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Beshear is a Democrat and also pro-abortion.

As much as we are loathe to admit it, pro-life positions on the ballot seem to be losers for Republicans. Which prompts the question: Why? For those of us who are ardent pro-life supporters, there are several hurdles that need to be overcome in the quest to end that particular practice. The biggest obstacle is left-wing lies about what being pro-life means and what abortion actually is.

Lefty Lies: “Stay Out of My Bedroom.” “My Body, My Choice.”

This particular combination of slogans at once embodies the libertarian distaste of government control and the liberals’ notion of bodily autonomy. And they are both misleading.

The “stay out of my bedroom” sentiment is laughable when colored by the stark truth of what abortion is — killing an innocent and completely helpless human. Murder is something the government is against, ergo it is against the law to kill someone. So why is it suddenly acceptable to murder just because the victims are at their smallest stages of development? It’s also interesting to note that the same people who want the government out of their bedroom are many of the same people who want the government to dedicate whole months to what they do in the bedroom (e.g. Pride Month) along with all the other LGBTQ+ liturgical days of forced celebration.

“My body, my choice” is a false premise. It implies a mother has a right to murder her unborn child simply because that child resides in her body. Leftists push the lie that if abortion were limited or abolished, mothers wouldn’t have a choice, i.e. no bodily autonomy. For most of these women, that choice happens before conception — before they jump into bed with someone to create that life.

Granted, in the cases of rape or incest, which by definition are coercion or force, that particular choice is taken away. Yet according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion group, rape and incest make up just 1% of all abortion cases.

There are several other lies employed by the Left, but these are the ones most often heard.

The Left’s View of Abortion Is, in Fact, Radical

This is perhaps the biggest pro-abortion boon of the whole debate. As much as Democrats try to deny that they support abortion up till birth, their every action and even party statement supports it. It’s absolutely radical to allow abortion at any point through all nine months of pregnancy. To put this in perspective, most Western countries only allow abortion through 20 weeks of pregnancy, give or take. The U.S. is one of seven countries that allows abortions past 20 weeks gestation. The other countries are Canada, China, Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam. Note how many of those countries are oppressive communist regimes. It’s not a group we should be proud to be a part of.

In Virginia, Youngkin wants to pass a 15-week abortion ban. Fifteen weeks is pretty far along as it is, but not enough according to the Democrats. Twenty weeks is halfway through a pregnancy, and even that is not good enough for them.

As a mother of a 22-week unborn baby, abortion at this stage is unjustifiable. Babies this age have survived birth and are thriving; my cousin’s son is one of them. It’s also impossible to deny the humanity and life of the little human inside. They are wiggling, hiccuping, hitting and kicking, and responding to light and sounds. This is a life.

Lack of Republican Unity

Just like the clown show that Republicans enacted by unseating Kevin McCarthy before eventually choosing a new speaker of the House, Republicans are far from unified. Republicans become the catch-all party for a variety of ideological perspectives, particularly since the Democrats are increasingly radical. Abortion is no different, as Republicans hold a variety of positions on the pro-life question. Those who do support the pro-life cause tend to do an inadequate job of articulating the issue. As political pundit Matt Walsh put it:

Before you tell me that the pro-life message is a political loser, answer me this: how many Republican candidates fought back hard and effectively on this issue, actively went after the Left, ran ads attacking their opponent for supporting the dismemberment of fully developed infants (which nearly every Democrat does), and actually countered the Left’s pro-abortion narrative with a strong and affirmative pro-life narrative? It seems to me that the pro-life message is being blamed in races where the pro-life message was never even articulated. Has anyone ran an ad saying “Here’s what happens in a third trimester abortion. My opponent supports this”? This is the most basic strategy and I’m not aware of anyone who has even attempted it. The strategy is simple: go on offense and tell the truth.

Fox News’s Kayleigh McEnany articulates this sentiment another way, saying: “Every ballot initiative, post-Dobbs, has been a loss for the pro-life movement. As a party, we must not just be a pro-baby party. That’s a great thing. We must also be a pro-mother party. We need a national strategy.”

Republicans also often neglect to show compassion toward the mother and help her feel more supported. Support is something a huge number of these desperate women are seeking. That’s hard to demonstrate on the campaign trail but not impossible.

Pro-life Republicans have an uphill battle in the continued fight for life. However, it is one that we can and should win. It may not happen now — it make take another 50 years just like overturning Roe v. Wade — but it is a battle worth fighting. These mothers and their children are worth it."
Nov 09 2023,Ohio vote solidifies abortion freedoms,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/nov/09/ohio-vote-solidifies-abortion-freedoms,"WASHINGTON -- A proposal to enshrine abortion rights in Ohio's Constitution was approved in a statewide election Tuesday, with a significant number of Republicans joining with Democrats to ensure the measure's passage.

When the Associated Press called the race, votes cast in favor of the proposal were winning with about 56% of the vote, compared with about 44% for votes cast in opposition -- a lead of approximately 232,000 votes as of the Tuesday night tally.

Known as ""Issue 1,"" the proposal would amend the state Constitution to establish the right to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions"" on matters including abortion, contraception and fertility treatment. It would also allow for abortions to be banned once it has been established that the fetus can survive outside of the womb, unless a physician determines that continuing with the pregnancy would endanger the patient's ""life or health.""

Tuesday's vote followed a similar path as an August ballot measure election that would have raised the threshold to amend the state Constitution from a simple majority to 60% of the statewide vote. The August measure, which failed 57% to 43%, did not mention abortion or reproductive rights specifically but quickly became a proxy fight over reproductive rights as it would have made it more difficult for Tuesday's measure to pass.

In this election, the more than 836,000 advance votes cast by mail or in-person before Election Day broke heavily in favor of the amendment, with Yes votes receiving roughly 63%, compared with 37% for No votes. This is not surprising, considering Ohio Democrats campaigned heavily in favor of Issue 1, and pre-Election Day voting tends to skew heavily Democratic.

The Yes side also appeared to have a slight lead among votes cast on Election Day, which is notable because Election Day votes have tended to favor Republicans ever since Donald Trump discouraged advance voting in his failed 2020 reelection bid.

When the AP called the race, the No side was still ahead among Election Day voters but not by enough to offset the advantage the Yes side had amassed in the pre-Election Day advance votes.

The scope of the victory for the Yes side suggests that a significant number of Republicans voted in favor of Issue 1. While the No side appears to have won all 44 of the counties Trump won in 2020 with more than 70% of the vote, the Yes side won 9 of the 10 counties that Trump won with less than 60% of the vote. Yes was also leading in a third of the counties that Trump carried, with between 60% and 70% of the vote. The No side trailed Trump's performance in every county in the state except for Putnam, as of the latest tally. Yes votes had an overwhelming lead in areas President Joe Biden won in 2020, as expected.

The pro-abortion rights forces appear to have scored a broader victory geographically than they did in the August ballot measure vote. Yes was leading in 21 of the 22 counties that the pro-abortion rights position won in August and also prevailed in a handful of additional counties that previously sided with the abortion rights foes.

Yes had comfortable leads in the counties making up the metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Youngstown, mirroring the August vote. No was ahead in Dayton and appears to have picked up Toledo.

Ohio is the latest state to put the question of abortion rights directly to voters. It's also the latest state where voters decided either in favor of protecting access to abortion or against placing further restrictions on the procedure. In 2022, voters in California, Michigan and Vermont approved state constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights, while voters in Kansas and Kentucky rejected measures to amend their state constitutions to restrict the procedure. Montana voters also rejected a proposal that year backed by opponents of abortion rights."
Nov 08 2023,Pro-abortion amendment passes in Ohio,World Magazine,right,https://wng.org/roundups/pro-abortion-amendment-passes-in-ohio-1699475262,"At the Protect Women Ohio election results watch party in downtown Columbus, even the sugar cookies bore slogans of the campaign against Issue 1, Ohio’s ballot measure that would add a right to abortion to the state constitution. “No Issue 1,” “protect parents’ rights,” or “more extreme than you know” read the frosting in red, white, and blue.

But less than two hours after polls closed, word spread around the room that the Associated Press had called the race in favor of the pro-abortion amendment. At about a quarter till 10, Aaron Baer, president of the public policy organization Center for Christian Virtue, read a concession statement from a lectern at the front of the room. Members of the Protect Women Ohio coalition lined up on either side of him.

“We know that Issue 1 does not represent Ohio values,” Baer read. “It took $35 million in out-of-state funding and ads filled with fear and deceit to push the most radical abortion agenda into our state constitution.”

Unofficial results show Issue 1 passed 57 to 43 percent. Mirroring the statements of pro-life groups in other states that lost similar ballot efforts in 2022, the pro-life coalition pointed to funding as a dominant reason for the outcome. Pro-abortion groups outspent pro-lifers by nearly 3 to 1 in the months leading up to the vote. It seems like this did make a difference: Many voters I interviewed Tuesday echoed the talking points of the “Vote Yes” campaign while some hadn’t heard Protect Women Ohio’s primary arguments against the amendment. But, when pressed, others simply didn’t care about the issues pro-life groups campaigned on.

Leading up to election day, the campaign for the amendment called on Ohioans to vote yes to stop Ohio’s “extreme abortion ban.” In 2019, Ohio had passed a heartbeat law, which protected babies from abortion starting at around six weeks of gestation. It went into effect temporarily following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 until a court order blocked its enforcement. Since that ruling, abortions have been legal in Ohio until 22 weeks. But most voters I interviewed—both supporters and opponents of the amendment—didn’t know that.

One voter at a precinct in Columbus told me she thought abortions were illegal. Others I talked to said they believed it was only legal under certain medical conditions, and several thought the heartbeat law was still in effect.

Some pro-Issue 1 voters also mentioned supporting women who choose to abort their babies in cases including rape as another motivation for their votes, echoing the pro-abortion campaign that trashed Ohio’s heartbeat law for not including rape and incest exceptions. “I don’t think a woman should have to be forced to carry a child to term in those circumstances,” said Lisa LaSalle, 44, at the same precinct in Columbus.

For Delaware County voter Ashley Baxter, her vote on Issue 1 was personal. She said she had a miscarriage while the heartbeat law was in effect. She needed a dilation and curettage procedure, which is also used to kill living babies in abortion, to remove the dead baby’s remains. But her insurance company denied her claim. “My OBGYN had to submit a lot of medical records to prove that it was medically necessary,” Baxter said. She voted yes “because I feel like we should have the right to make decisions about our own bodies. And in the case of a miscarriage, if you need medical assistance, that should be your option.”

At Tuesday night’s watch party, longtime pro-lifer and Heartbeat International board chair Peggy Hartshorn suggested Baxter’s experience could have had little to do with the heartbeat law. “It’s common practice for insurance companies to routinely deny things that they actually do cover,” Hartshorn said, citing her husband’s experience with denied claims for other medical expenses.

Also at the watch party, Protect Women Ohio spokeswoman Amy Natoce said “miscarriage care is absolutely available in Ohio. It always has been and it always will be—it is completely unaffected by abortion law.” She blamed confusion about the legal situation in Ohio on Issue 1’s supporters.

“They’ve been running ads, misleading Ohioans about what current abortion law is about, telling Ohioans we don’t have miscarriage care—which is not true—telling Ohioans we don’t have access to contraception, which is not true,” Natoce said. “And unfortunately, voters hear those lies.”

Meanwhile, some voters I interviewed had not heard the pro-life coalition’s concerns about the amendment, which included the warning that the law could upend the existing parental notification requirement for minors seeking abortions and the ban on partial-birth abortions. While many voters cited concerns about these laws as reasons contributing to their no votes, some yes voters agreed the parental notification law should remain in place but didn’t believe the amendment puts that requirement in jeopardy.

Some polling suggests that parental notification laws are popular even among pro-abortion voters, and partial-birth abortions have been historically unpopular with Americans. But some voters had no problem with the idea of Ohio discarding either of the state’s current pro-life laws on these issues.

Columbus voter Joey Boggs, 29, said he hadn’t heard the concerns about the amendment allowing partial-birth abortions. “But again, I think that should be [left] to the family’s decision if the doctor recommends something like that, if it’s affecting the woman’s health before she gives birth,” he said. “I think there’s too many factors to just limit it to one thing.”

Delaware County voter Jennifer Christ, 40, said partial-birth abortions only happen “if there is an extreme medical situation … so I don’t think that there’s a need to ban it.”

Christ also said she would like to see the pro-abortion amendment discard the state’s parental notification requirement. “Yes, I would be okay with that,” she said. “I mean, I am a parent. And so I understand wanting to know anything that’s going on with your child, especially a large medical decision. But at the same time, I also know that that would put a lot of girls in a dangerous situation, if they weren’t comfortable with their families knowing things.”

Natoce from Protect Women Ohio said the pro-abortion groups funding Issue 1 have made no secret that they believe laws like the parental consent requirement should be abolished. Now that Issue 1 has passed, pro-lifers in Ohio expect these groups to chip away at remaining protections in the state.

“Issue 1 ties the hands of our legislature in many ways, which is why we worked so hard as a state to defeat it,” Natoce said to reporters after the pro-life coalition conceded the race. “Our legislature is pro-life, we have a pro-life governor, attorney general, statewide elected officials, and they’ll continue to do what they can within the bounds of this amendment to protect life.”

The new law expands abortion access in the state by making it easier for abortion facilities to open. Also, those seeking an abortion will no longer need a special rider on their insurance.

""We've been fighting to protect abortion in Michigan for years,"" Whitmer said. ""When Roe vs. Wade was repealed last year, our fight took on a whole new level of urgency.""

The laws' passage was being opposed by the Michigan Coalition to Protect A Woman's Right to Know, which is made up of the Michigan Catholic Conference, Right to Life of Michigan and eight other organizations.

Nov 07 2023,Ohio Passes Constitutional Amendment on Abortion,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/ohio-passes-constitutional-amendment-on-abortion-5523833,"Voters passed an citizen-led amendment to guarantee rights to abortion and other “reproductive decisions” in their state constitution.

A months-long push to cement abortion as a right in Ohio’s constitution prevailed on Nov. 7 as voters turned out to weigh in on the controversial ballot measure.

Issue 1 was the only abortion-related question on the ballot nationwide this Election Day, drawing the eyes—and funds—of abortion and pro-life activists around the country.

At the time the Associated Press called the race, the yes vote on the measure was leading 57-42 percent. Many expect the results to foreshadow the outcomes of similar ballot initiatives planned for other states next year.

Early turnout in the election exceeded that of the state’s special election in August, with more than 860,000 people casting their ballots prior to Election Day.

That was also likely due in part to Issue 2, a citizen-led initiative to legalize marijuana purchases, sales, and, for adults aged 21 and older, possession.

At the time of reporting, the yes vote on that measure was leading 55-44 percent. Debate The newly-passed constitutional amendment establishes that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.”

Opponents of the measure objected to its broad language, noting that it applied to “every individual,” not just women or adults.

And although the amendment included a provision stating that abortion “may be prohibited after fetal viability,” it barred such a restriction in cases where the mother’s treating physician decides that the procedure is “necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.”

The treating physician, detractors noted, would be the same doctor paid to perform the abortion.

Other concerns voters raised included the possibility that the new law could be interpreted to include a right for children to undergo sex-altering procedures and that it would nullify an existing state law requiring parental consent for abortions performed on minors.

“Issue 1 on the ballot goes far beyond reasonableness,” northeastern Ohio resident and independent voter Joanne Arnett told The Epoch Times before voting against the measure.

“I cringe to imagine putting doctors and nurses in the situation to kill a fully formed child right before birth,” she said. “I cringe to imagine a 30-year who was convinced as a child by teachers and psychologists to undergo removal and mutilation of their sex organs and put them on hormone blockers and then have the realization years later of the damage that was done to them.”

But Mathis Kleckley, a Christian bus driver from Reynoldsburg, said he voted yes on Issue 1 because he believes that God gives people choices, and that others should not have the ability to “play God” and take them away.

“We don’t want the government playing God either,” he said.

Other proponents have pushed back on claims that Issue 1 would legalize abortion through birth or erase parents’ rights.

The measure, they held, would simply solidify protections for rights that have been challenged nationally since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year in its Dobbs v. Jackson ruling.

In Ohio, abortion is currently legal through 22 weeks gestation. A 2019 limit on abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected—usually at around six weeks—that has been on hold due to litigation will likely be rendered moot by Issue 1’s passage.

“Fundamental freedoms are fundamental freedoms, right?” Abhi Rahman, national communications director for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said on a Nov. 6 call with reporters.

“At the end of the day, people know what they’re voting for. People know the main part of it is to make sure that people in Ohio have access to reproductive health care,” he added. “And, you know, regardless of how broad it is, that’s the important part, really—putting things the way they were before Roe fell and before the Dobbs decision.”

Implications Several other states have weighed in on abortion since the court’s June 2022 ruling with similar results.

Last year, voters in Kansas voted down a ballot referendum that aimed to establish that the state’s constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion. A similar measure in Kentucky met the same fate, while a referendum to increase protections for babies who survive abortion attempts was rejected in Montana.

As Ohio’s election results were announced, reactions from interested parties poured in from around the country.

For Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Missouri-based Abortion Survivors Network , the outcome was disappointing, but not wholly discouraging.

“The Dobbs decision returned the question of abortion to the states, and the people of Ohio have cast their vote to amend their constitution,” she told The Epoch Times. “Despite this, I believe that the people of Ohio will take this opportunity to ensure every woman knows that abortion is not the only choice she has and will strive to provide solutions to the challenges women face when contemplating terminating their pregnancy.”

Meanwhile, for the pro-abortion Indivisible Project, the results were a reason for celebration.

“Tonight, we are elated by this pro-choice victory in Ohio and in awe of the voters and dedicated leaders on the ground who sent a clear message ahead of 2024: abortion access is non-negotiable,” Indivisible Project Managing Director Mari Urbina said in a statement.

“Despite the odds and the obstacles voters faced, this election demonstrates the enduring belief in reproductive freedom, and that will always be stronger than the well-funded attempts to subvert it,” she continued, adding that her organization was “taking notes” from how the Ohio results might foretell future initiatives in other states.

Next year, voters in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and potentially South Dakota will be asked to sound off on their own abortion referendums.

But only time will tell if, as many expect, the outcome in Ohio will serve as a bellwether for those other initiatives.

Nov 07 2023,Ohio Makes Abortion A Constitutional Right,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/07/ohio-abortion-constitutional-right,"Ohio voters approved an amendment that would make abortion legal up to birth in some cases in an election Tuesday, multiple outlets have reported.

Votes in favor of the amendment outnumber those opposed by 57.7% to 42.3% with 40% of votes counted, according to the New York Times. Votes in favor outnumber those opposed by 57.7% to 42.3% with 37.5% of votes counted, according to The Washington Post. Both outlets project the amendment to pass.

The amendment now overrides a six-week abortion ban which was allowed to go into effect in the state following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Center.

“Every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on: contraception; fertility treatment; continuing one’s own pregnancy; miscarriage care; and abortion,” the amendment reads.

The amendment allows abortion to be prohibited after “fetal viability,” which is the point at the pregnancy when a doctor decides the unborn baby has a “significant” likelihood of surviving outside the womb.

“The State shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against either: An individual’s voluntary exercise of this right or; A person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right, unless the State demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.”

“Ohio’s resounding support for this constitutional amendment reaffirms Democratic priorities and sends a strong message to the state GOP that reproductive rights are non-negotiable,” the Democrat Legislative Campaign Committee said in a statement provided to the Caller. “Across the country, Republicans are dead-set on restricting fundamental freedoms such as abortion rights while the DLCC is dedicated to putting Democrats in office to protect these rights.”

Opponents of the proposal argued that the amendment would strike down parental consent laws surrounding abortion, placing young women at risk of undergoing dangerous procedures without their parents’ knowledge.

“Issue 1 passed because abortion activists and outside Democrat donors ran a campaign of fear to Ohio voters: vote for this ballot measure or women will die,” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. “Their pervasive lie that women will die without Issue 1 was propped up by massive ad spending, funded by George Soros and a left-wing media machine which operated like Planned Parenthood’s PR department.”

“There have been many valuable lessons learned from Issue 1. Moving forward in states where abortion will be on the ballot in 2024, pro-life, pro-woman coalitions will need to devote more resources to compassionate pro-life messages for women and their children, combatting the campaign of fear from the other side.”

In August, Ohio voters rejected an attempt to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution. The measure would have raised the threshold from 50 percent to 60 percent, making it harder for pro-abortion activists to rally the support necessary to enshrine abortion in the state’s constitution.

Michigan voted to add an amendment to its state constitution by a margin of more than 10 points that will allow abortion up to 24 weeks during the 2022 midterm elections."

(AP) — A Republican district attorney has appealed a court ruling that determined an 1849 Wisconsin law does not ban abortions, a decision that cleared the way for abortions to resume in the state. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski on Tuesday appealed the ruling from a Dane County judge that said there is no state ban on abortions. The appeal was expected and the case is likely to ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Urmanski asked that the appeal be heard in the state’s Waukesha-based 2nd District Court of Appeals where three of the four judges are conservatives. Appeals are heard by three-judge panels.

Dec 20 2023,12 states where the fate of abortion rights could be on 2024 ballots,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/20/abortion-rights-2024-ballot-measures/,"Voters in about a dozen states in 2024 could decide the fate of abortion rights with constitutional amendments on the ballot in a pivotal election year — including in several battlegrounds that will be key to deciding the presidential race and which party controls Congress. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight Abortion rights advocates chose the path of constitutional amendments because if passed, they would supersede any law enacted by state legislatures. Those advocates have reason to be hopeful: Since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last June, every ballot measure that has sought to preserve or expand abortion access has been successful, while those that have sought to restrict abortion access have failed — even in states that skew conservative.

Weeks after the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, voters in deep-red Kansas defeated a ballot measure that would have removed abortion protections from the state’s constitution. Last November, voters in Michigan, California and Vermont approved ballot initiatives that enshrined the right to abortion in state constitutions, while voters in Kentucky and Montana defeated antiabortion ballot measures. Voters in Ohio approved a measure to enshrine the right to an abortion last month, despite efforts by Republican officials to hamstring the process by raising the threshold required for a ballot measure to pass.

“It’s hard to overstate the momentum, the wind that’s at the back of abortion rights advocates using ballot measures to pass constitutional amendments,” said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a group that supports state ballot measure efforts.

The issue has proved to galvanize turnout and play a major role in electing politicians who support abortion access. While abortion rights groups say the issue transcends party lines, the spillover effect has tended to benefit Democratic candidates who campaign to protect reproductive rights.

Kelsey Pritchard, director of state public affairs at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said elected officials need to “sound the alarm” on potential ballot measures that would preserve or expand abortion access. She accused abortion rights groups of misleading voters about the severity of the impact of abortion restrictions, contending that states with restrictions still allow for “the timely medical care of pregnant women experiencing an emergency.”

“Timely medical care” has not been the reality for many pregnant patients in several states that have greatly restricted reproductive care, with some of them suing for lack of medical care. One includes a Dallas-area woman, Kate Cox, who sought an abortion after learning that her fetus had a fatal genetic condition.

Voters in Maryland and New York, two blue states, will decide next year whether to codify a right to abortion in their state’s constitution because of measures put on the ballot by their state legislatures. In nine other states where the state constitution can be amended through citizen-initiated ballot measures, organizers are working to gather signatures to put the question directly before voters. Voters in at least one state, Iowa, are seeking to add a measure that restricts access to abortion.

The likelihood of successfully getting on the ballot differs from state to state, because of varied processes and the potential for lawsuits. Here is a look at the 12 states where voters could weigh in on abortion in 2024, ranked from the campaigns most likely to make it to the ballot to the ones that face the most obstacles.

Definite ballot measure to protect abortion rights Return to menu

Maryland Return to menu Current law: Since 1992, Maryland has allowed abortion until viability and after viability if the life or health of the mother is at risk, or if the fetus isn’t viable. Advertisement The initiative: The Right to Reproductive Freedom initiative is a legislative-backed measure that would add the right to an abortion to the Declaration of Rights section in the state constitution, adding that every individual “has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end one’s own pregnancy.” State of play: The measure failed previously in the legislature, before Roe was overturned. But a revived measure passed both chambers with the required 60 percent support in April, placing it on the November ballot. The politics: Maryland is a deep-blue state that President Biden won by more than 33 percentage points. Abortion rights advocates hope candidates vowing to protect rights will be buoyed by the ballot measure in their competitive local races.

New York Return to menu Current law: Abortion until 24 weeks gestation is legal in New York. Advertisement The initiative: A legislature-driven initiative would protect abortion rights as part of an expanded Equal Rights Amendment that will appear on the ballot in November. Specifically on abortion, the measure protects against discrimination for pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes and would protect against government action that could limit reproductive care. State of play: The New York legislature fulfilled the requirement of passing the ERA twice consecutively through the legislature — in July 2022 and again in January. It will be on the ballot for voters in November. The politics: New York is a blue state that Biden won by more than 30 points. But New York will be a crucial battleground to determine control of the U.S. House with seven competitive seats. Democrats hope that the ballot initiative could lead to high turnout and benefit Democratic candidates. The initiative is a critical part of the election, particularly as Democrats plan to focus on anti-choice positions espoused by many Republicans.

Possible ballot measure to protect abortion rights Return to menu

Arizona Return to menu Current law: A 2022 Arizona law that went into effect after Roe v. Wade was overturned bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for life endangerment and medical emergencies. There is also a territorial law — one that was passed in 1864, before Arizona became a state — that bans and criminalizes almost all abortions. The Arizona Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments to consider whether the conflicting laws can coexist. Advertisement The initiative: Arizona for Abortion Access, a coalition of abortion rights advocates, is behind a proposed ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution. State of play: The campaign in Arizona has been endorsed by numerous reproductive health and civil rights groups, including the ACLU of Arizona, and the state chapters of Planned Parenthood Advocates and Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly NARAL). The campaign must submit 383,923 valid signatures by July 3 to appear on the 2024 ballot. In Arizona, a simple majority is required to pass a ballot measure. The politics: Arizona is a battleground state that will be critical in the 2024 election cycle. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.) announced last year that she was leaving the Democratic Party to become an independent, complicating the thin Senate majority of Democrats. She is being challenged for reelection next year by Rep. Ruben Gallego (D) and Republican Kari Lake, who unsuccessfully ran for Arizona governor last year. Having an abortion measure on the ballot is likely to boost voter turnout, but it is unclear which Senate candidate would benefit. In 2020, Biden won Arizona by only 0.30 percentage points, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since 1996.

Nevada Return to menu Current law: Nevada state law allows abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks when a doctor has “reasonable cause” to believe it is “necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant person.” Advertisement The initiative: A coalition of abortion rights advocates called Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom filed paperwork for a proposed ballot initiative that would amend the state constitution to include abortion before “fetal viability” as a fundamental right. The ballot measure, if passed, would be “an added layer of protection” for reproductive rights in the state, said Caroline Mello Roberson, director of state campaigns for Reproductive Freedom for All. State of play: The campaign is collecting signatures and must submit 102,362 by June 26. A district court judge last month struck down the group’s petition, saying it covered more than a single subject, but abortion rights advocates are hopeful the state’s all-female Supreme Court will rule in their favor on appeal. Nevada requires two consecutive votes of the people to amend the state constitution through a citizen-initiated ballot measure — meaning that, if the ballot measure passes with a simple majority in 2024, the question will return to the ballot in 2026. If it passes again then with a simple majority, the state constitution will be amended. Advertisement The politics: Biden narrowly carried Nevada in 2020, and the battleground state continues to produce extremely tight races: Last year, Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection in Nevada by 0.77 percentage points. Having an abortion measure on the ballot in 2024 could boost Democratic turnout that would help Biden as well as Sen. Jacky Rosen (D), who is facing a similarly tough race for reelection next year. Share this article Share

Colorado Return to menu Current law: Colorado is the first state to statutorily protect abortion. It did so in 1967, five years before Roe was originally decided. While Colorado has had few limits on abortion, a proposition passed in 1984 restricted the use of health insurance and Medicaid for abortion. The initiative: The ballot initiative would enshrine the right to abortion in the Colorado constitution, and would allow health insurance coverage of an abortion. The initiative says the “government shall not deny, impede, or discriminate against the exercise of that right, including prohibiting health insurance coverage for abortion.” Advertisement State of play: Led by the groups Cobalt and Colorado Organization for Latina Opportunity and Reproductive Rights, signatures are being gathered — 124,238 are necessary — and then must be approved by the secretary of state. The measure would then be a yes-or-no vote on the ballot, requiring 55 percent of votes to be “yes” to be adopted. Abortion rights rights advocates beat back a ballot initiative in 2020 to restrict abortion rights before Roe was overturned. Coloradans overwhelmingly defeated it, outperforming Biden at the top of the ticket by 25,000 votes and John Hickenlooper, who won the Senate race, by more than 100,000 votes. The politics: Abortion rights groups have long been on the defensive. In addition to 2020, there have been antiabortion ballot initiatives three other times since 2008. This is the first time they are being proactive and trying to pass a measure that enshrines the right in the constitution. Advocates were very intentional in choosing a presidential year when voter turnout would be high. There are no other statewide races on the ballot in 2024, but Colorado will see at least two competitive House races, including that of Rep. Lauren Boebert (R).

Montana Return to menu Current law: Montana has abortion protections in the state constitution under the right to privacy, though Republicans — who control the governor’s office and both chambers of the state legislature — tried to pursue restrictions. The initiative: Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana last month filed paperwork for a ballot measure that would affirm “the right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion” in the state constitution. State of play: The state attorney general is reviewing the legality of the ballot language. If it passes, the campaign must submit 60,359 valid signatures by July 19 for the measure to appear on the 2024 ballot. Montana voters last year rejected a referendum that would have criminalized medical professionals if they did not give care to any infant born alive, at any stage of development. The so-called born alive referendum was criticized for mischaracterizing abortions, and it was ultimately defeated at the polls by more than five percentage points. The politics: Sen. Jon Tester (D) announced earlier this year he would seek reelection to a fourth term, to the relief of many Democrats as the party faces a tough Senate map in 2024. Having an abortion measure on the ballot could boost Democratic turnout and help Tester win a difficult reelection race.

Nebraska Return to menu Current law: Nebraska has been one of the more aggressive states attempting to roll back abortion rights, even when Roe was in place. After Roe fell, the Nebraska legislature passed a 12-week abortion ban with no exceptions for the life and health of the mother earlier this year after falling one vote short of a six-week ban. The initiative: The citizen-driven initiative Protect Our Rights is proposing a constitutional amendment to protect a right to abortion until “fetal viability.” State of play: Since the initiative was filed with the state, advocates have begun collecting the roughly 128,000 signatures of registered voters who hail from 38 counties as required by July. The politics: Nebraska is a deep-red state, voting for Donald Trump by 29 percentage points in 2020. Voters are increasingly using ballot initiatives in Nebraska to advance objectives the legislature refuses to take up. While incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer (R) is expected to easily win reelection, if the abortion initiative makes the ballot, it could impact the race of Rep. Don Bacon, who is one of the 17 Republican House members who represent a Biden-won district.

Florida Return to menu Current law: Florida has a 15-week abortion ban, but a six-week ban signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) could go into effect if the Florida Supreme Court ultimately approves the 15-week one. The initiative: The citizen-driven initiative to pass the Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion is led by Floridians Protecting Freedom. It would codify in the constitution a right to abortion until “viability.” State of play: The group says it has surpassed the required 891,523 verified signatures due by Feb. 1. If the state certifies the effort, then the state Supreme Court will determine if the measure is valid to be placed on the ballot. The state Supreme Court has been hostile to abortion rights, and some advocates worry it will reject the effort. The politics: Florida is a crucial state for the abortion rights movement as DeSantis, a GOP presidential hopeful, presided over the passage of one of the most restrictive bans in the country. Trump now calls Florida home and won the state by more than three percentage points in 2020. There is also a Senate race in Florida that is seen as a key pickup opportunity for Democrats. Advocates who are pushing the initiative are adamant that it isn’t tied to partisan politics, and they note that at least 150,000 Republicans have signed onto the measure.

Missouri Return to menu Current law: Missouri has a near-total ban on abortion, with exceptions only for life endangerment and medical emergencies, that went into effect after Roe was overturned. The initiatives: There have been numerous proposals submitted to the secretary of state’s office. Missourians for Constitutional Freedom filed 11 petitions with varying language: All would seek to overturn the state’s ban by enshrining in the state constitution “the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive health care.” The Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, led by longtime GOP operative Jamie Corley, filed multiple petitions with varying language that would add exceptions for rape and incest to the state’s current ban. The petitions also seek to legalize abortions in the state until 12 weeks of pregnancy. State of play: The efforts by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom are supported by the ACLU of Missouri and are tied up in a legal battle with the secretary of state over potential language. The efforts led by Corley also face an uphill battle, as they do not have the support of national abortion rights groups, who argue that they would not do enough to expand and protect reproductive rights. A campaign must submit at least 171,592 valid signatures by May 5 to appear on the 2024 ballot. The politics: Missouri has some of the strictest restrictions on abortion in the country, and the state — which Trump won by more than 15 points in 2020 — is reliably conservative. Sen. Josh Hawley (R) is up for reelection next year, and an abortion-related ballot measure could galvanize voter turnout for his to-be-determined Democratic opponent.

Arkansas Return to menu Current law: Arkansas has a near-total ban on abortion, with exceptions only for life endangerment, that went into effect after Roe was overturned. The initiative: A group called Arkansans for Limited Government has proposed a constitutional amendment that would “prevent the state from restricting access to abortion up to 18 weeks after conception or in the instance of rape or incest, fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant woman’s life or health.” State of play: The state attorney general last month rejected the wording for the proposed ballot measure, sending it back to Arkansans for Limited Government to redraft. If the group prevails and the attorney general approves a reworded ballot measure, the group would need to collect 90,704 valid signatures by July 5 to gain ballot access. The politics: Ruby-red Arkansas will be an extremely challenging state in which to pass a ballot measure expanding abortion access. Republicans control the governor’s office and both chambers of the state legislature, and Arkansas’s entire congressional delegation is Republican. The group behind the ballot measure efforts is emphasizing a libertarian approach, arguing that matters such as abortion “are private and not to be dictated by the government.”

South Dakota Return to menu Current law: A trigger law banning all abortions in South Dakota, with no exceptions for rape or incest, went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. In addition, state law dictates that anyone who helps someone procure an abortion, unless deemed medically necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant person, could face a felony charge. The initiative: Dakotans for Health filed paperwork proposing a citizen-initiated ballot measure that would establish a right to an abortion in the state’s constitution. If passed, the state could not regulate abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, could regulate abortion if “reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman” during the second trimester, and could regulate or even ban abortion in the third trimester, with exceptions for “life or health of the pregnant woman.” State of play: National reproductive rights groups are sitting out this campaign, saying the language in the proposed ballot measure will not do enough to restore abortion rights in South Dakota. Dakotans for Health must submit 35,017 signatures by May 7 to get on the 2024 ballot — where it needs a simple majority to pass. The politics: South Dakota is as conservative as it gets: Trump defeated Biden in the state in 2020 with nearly 62 percent of the vote, and Republicans control the governor’s office and both chambers of the state legislature. All three members of South Dakota’s congressional delegation are Republican.

The ruling was issued after the woman, Kate Cox, already for the procedure according to her attorneys. After a challenge from the Texas Attorney General, her attorneys say Cox left the state because she's been in and out of emergency rooms and ""she couldn't wait any longer.""

Hours later, the Texas Supreme Court would rule in favor of the A.G., despite national medical groups filing emergency briefs urging otherwise.

""This is a grave threat to people in Texas, to women in Texas and to medical professionals in Texas."" President and CEO of the legal and public policy nonprofit Democracy Forward Skye Perryman said.

Perryman says the emergency court briefs her group filed on behalf of two national medical groups collectively representing tens of thousands of doctors across the country.

""[Doctors] whose hands have been tied as a result of an attorney general that is not protecting the health and wellbeing of Texas Women.""

She says Cox having to flee the state isn't just a dangerous precedent for her, but millions of other women across the state.

""It could lead to more medical complications,"" Perryman said. ""And we also know that there are many people many millions of women in Texas who are not able to travel outside of the state to get the care that they need.""

Cox is close to 21-weeks pregnant. In a historic move, she went to the courts last week to ask for an abortion after her physician determined her fetus had full trisomy 18, a lethal fetal anomaly.

The courts granted her request, but it was swiftly blocked by an emergency stay requested by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.

""Care that the Attorney General of Texas has sought to block her from obtaining, you know, care that is necessary for her life, for her health, for her future fertility and the well-being of her family."" Perryman said.

But President and attorney for the nonprofit Texas Values Jonathan Saenz says he wants to know who is advocating for the child.

""This case has been a lot about other issues, and we haven't heard a lot of talk about the baby's life,"" Saenz said. ""And that's what Texas is about.""

He points to a 2020 medical study that looked at a 26-year-old woman who was diagnosed with the chromosomal deformity, also known as Edward's Syndrome. The same study says there is about a 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 chance of living past the age of one with that diagnosis.

""One of the things that study says is that early detection and parental education has a lot to do with babies surviving well into adulthood."" Saenz said.

Only about 50 percent of babies diagnosed with Edward's Syndrome live past the first week. But even survival means learning and physical disabilities, and medical issues that can range from heart, respiratory or kidney conditions.

""We are very concerned about Miss Cox's case,"" Perryman said. ""We're encouraged that she may be able to obtain care elsewhere, but we know that for millions of women that is not an option.""

While Saenz says there aren't any legal penalties for leaving the state to get an abortion, he hopes Cox will choose to get a second opinion.

""I hope that, you know, my opinion - she's not exploited by the obsessed pro-abortion movement, and that she knows that baby has a chance to live, and she has a chance to continue to be a mother."" Saenz said.

Cox's attorneys didn't say where she was going or share any further details about any out-of-state procedure.

CBS Austin reached out to Attorney General Ken Paxton's Office for comment but haven't heard back."
Dec 11 2023,Whitmer signs last of abortion rights bill package into law,ABC 12,center,https://abc12.com/news/politics/whitmer-signs-last-of-abortion-rights-bill-package-into-law/article_5b6b2390-9857-11ee-90a2-8757e80c7df5.html,"LANSING, Mich. (WJRT) - The last of a series of controversial abortion bills is now law in Michigan.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed the final bill in the Reproductive Health Act on Monday morning. Under this law, women will no longer need to purchase an abortion health insurance rider.

Last month, Whitmer signed laws that expand access for abortion providers across the state and repealed laws that criminalized doctors and nurses.

""We've been fighting to protect abortion in Michigan for a long time, but when Roe vs. Wade was repealed last year, our fight took on a whole new level of urgency,"" Whitmer said.

These bills fall under Michigan's Proposal 3, which received 56% voter approval in November 2022."
Dec 11 2023,Woman Carrying Doomed Fetus Forced to Flee Texas For Abortion,Daily Beast,left,https://thedailybeast.com/woman-carrying-doomed-fetus-forced-to-flee-texas-for-abortion,"The Texas Supreme Court on Monday night agreed with Attorney General Ken Paxton and overruled a lower court’s decision that would have allowed a woman carrying a fetus with a fatal condition to undergo an emergency abortion.

The ruling came hours after Kate Cox’s attorneys said she is being forced to leave Texas to obtain an abortion, just days after she petitioned a state court to allow her to obtain the procedure.

Cox, 31, filed for an emergency restraining order against Texas’ abortion ban last week, after discovering that her fetus carried Trisomy 18—a chromosomal anomaly that would cause it to die shortly after birth. Doctors told her that carrying the pregnancy to term could threaten her health and future fertility. The historic case was the first time since Roe v Wade that a pregnant patient asked a judge to rule on their ability to get an abortion.

A district court judge sided with Cox on Thursday, saying that forcing her to risk her ability to have children in the future would be a “genuine miscarriage of justice.” But the Texas Supreme Court halted that ruling the next day, saying it needed more time to consider the case.

Cox chose to leave the state to obtain the abortion on Monday, her lawyers at the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.”

Texas currently bans abortion in all cases except when the pregnant patient’s life is at risk. Twenty women and two doctors are suing the state of Texas, arguing the law is not clear about pregnancies that threaten patients’ health and that it forces doctors to deny them care or risk jail time. The Supreme Court has yet to make a ruling on that case.

In Cox’s case, she learned in November that her fetus carried Trisomy 18 and asked to have an abortion to prevent the baby’s suffering and preserve her own health. Cox had been in and out of the emergency room in the preceding weeks because of complications with the pregnancy. But according to her suit, doctors told her their “hands [were] tied,” and that she would have to wait til the fetus died or carry the pregnancy to term and have a C-section.

In a statement at the time, Cox said it was “not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when.”

“I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer,” she said. “I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health and a future pregnancy.”

After a 45-minute hearing Thursday, District Court Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted Cox’s request for a restraining order protecting her and her doctor from prosecution and civil liability. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately asked the Supreme Court to weigh in and issued a letter threatening anyone who provided the abortion with prosecution. The higher court halted the ruling on Friday.

On Monday, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in favor of Paxton, noting that the “good faith belief” that the abortion was medically necessary, provided by the doctor involved in the case, Dr. Damla Karsan, did not meet state requirements.

The court added that Karsan needed to prove there was “reasonable medical judgment,” that Cox has a “life-threatening physical condition” that places her “at risk of death” or “poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.”

“The law leaves to physicians—not judges—both the discretion and the responsibility to exercise their reasonable medical judgment, given the unique facts and circumstances of each patient,” the ruling says.

“If a doctor, using her “reasonable medical judgment,” decides that a pregnant woman has such a condition, then the exception applies, and Texas law does not prohibit the abortion.”

In her statement, Northup said the case was an example of why “judges and politicians should not be making healthcare decisions for pregnant people.”

“Kate's case has shown the world that abortion bans are dangerous for pregnant people, and exceptions don’t work,” she said. “She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family. While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”"
Dec 11 2023,Whitmer repeals Michigan law restricting insurance coverage for abortion,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/whitmer-repeals-michigan-law-insurance-abortion,"Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) signed legislation on Monday repealing a 2013 law restricting health insurance coverage for abortion.

The measure repeals the decade-old statute that stipulated health insurers could only cover abortions through the provision of separate insurance riders.

BIDEN LOSING YOUNG VOTERS TO TRUMP AS HE FALLS BEHIND IN TWO SWING STATES

During her position as minority leader of the Michigan Senate, Whitmer condemned the law as requiring women to purchase “rape insurance” to cover an abortion in the event that they became pregnant after a sexual assault.

Whitmer disclosed her own sexual assault publicly for the first time during her speech against the legislation on Dec. 11, 2013. Although Whitmer did not become pregnant, she said at the time that the issue was “personal to me and so many Michigan women.”

The legislation is part of a nine-bill legislative package that removes several restrictions on abortion and puts the language of the Reproductive Freedom for All constitutional amendment, known as Proposal 3, into state law.

“I am proud that in just over 18 months, we have gone from the repeal of Roe v. Wade to expanding reproductive freedom in Michigan with the passage of Proposal 3 and the Reproductive Health Act,” Whitmer said on signing the legislation.

Whitmer signed the landmark bill inside the Senate’s chamber, an uncommon place for a governor to sign legislation.

The Michigan Catholic Conference criticized the signing of Monday’s legislation, saying that the measure goes beyond what the voters were promised when they enshrined abortion rights into their state constitution in 2022.

Michigan Catholic Conference policy advocate Rebecca Mastee said that although voters were told that the new policies would restore the status quo of Roe v. Wade, “the abortion lobby has leveraged passage of the new constitutional amendment to make Michigan an extreme outlier on abortion policy.”

State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, the lead sponsor of the bill, said the legislation affirms the state’s commitment to bodily autonomy.

“We are saying definitively that Michigan is a state that values and protects the right of every person to determine their own reproductive future,” Pohutsky said."

Jan 05 2024,Supreme Court allows Idaho's near-total abortion ban in emergency room in blow to Biden,"""USA Today"" Contributor",left,https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/05/supreme-court-idaho-abortion-ban-emergency-room/71829321007,"WASHINGTON – The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban in emergency rooms for now, rebuffing a Biden administration effort to ensure additional access to the procedure in red-state hospitals.

The court also agreed to hear arguments in the case this spring, placing a second major abortion case before the justices just over a year after the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Idaho’s law makes it a crime for doctors to perform an abortion unless a physician can demonstrate that the mother's life is in danger. The Biden administration claimed a separate federal law requires emergency rooms to provide ""stabilizing care,"" including abortions, for a broader range of circumstances, such as if a patient's health is in ""serious jeopardy.""

When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, a significant part of the argument was that the issue should be returned to the states to decide. And while that has happened, many residual legal challenges over the procedure continue to percolate in federal courts.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

The Supreme Court has already agreed to hear a conservative appeal challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s decades-old approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.

At issue in this case is a federal law that requires hospitals that receive federal funding, such as through Medicare, to provide stabilizing treatment to patients even if they can’t afford to pay. The idea was to ensure hospitals would provide basic care to all patients.

After the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe, the Biden administration said that the federal law requires hospitals to provide that same care to pregnant patients, including performing an abortion, if necessary, regardless of a state ban on the procedure.

Idaho officials said President Joe Biden was attempting to interpret the Medicare law into a ""federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply.""

But the Justice Department said the guidance was simply clarifying existing federal law. That federal law, federal officials said, trumps state abortion bans that went into effect last year.

Women can experience severe medical conditions during pregnancy that would not be covered by exceptions for the life of a mother, including sepsis, uncontrollable bleeding, kidney failure, and loss of fertility.

Twenty conservative states, many with strict abortion bans, backed Idaho. But it's not only conservative states with strict bans where the Biden administration’s guidance would potentially have an impact.

Even states without strict abortion bans – or states with more expansive exceptions than Idaho’s – could be affected. For one thing, the federal law at issue applies to religiously affiliated hospitals that receive federal funding but decline to provide abortions even though their state law would otherwise allow them.

A federal appeals court in California sided with the Biden administration on a temporary basis earlier this month, blocking enforcement of the provisions of the Idaho law at issue."
Jan 05 2024,"The Supreme Court allows Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies",Texomas Homepage KFDX 3,center,https://texomashomepage.com/news/political-news/ap-the-supreme-court-allows-idaho-to-enforce-its-strict-abortion-ban-even-in-medical-emergencies,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Friday allowed Idaho to enforce its strict abortion ban, even in medical emergencies, while a legal fight continues.

The justices said they would hear arguments in April and put on hold a lower court ruling that had blocked the Idaho law in hospital emergencies, based on a lawsuit filed by the Biden administration.

The Idaho case gives the court its second major abortion dispute since the justices in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to severely restrict or ban abortion. The court also in the coming months is hearing a challenge to the Food and Drug Administration’s rules for obtaining mifepristone, one of two medications used in the most common method of abortion in the United States.

In the case over hospital emergencies, the Biden administration has argued that hospitals that receive Medicare funds are required by federal law to provide emergency care, potentially including abortion, no matter if there’s a state law banning abortion.

The administration issued guidance about the federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, two weeks after the high court ruling in 2022. The Democratic administration sued Idaho a month later.

U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Idaho agreed with the administration. But in a separate case in Texas, a judge sided with the state.

In a statement Friday night, President Joe Biden objected to the high court’s decision and said his administration “will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law.”

Idaho makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.

The administration argues that EMTALA requires health care providers to perform abortions for emergency room patients when needed to treat an emergency medical condition, even if doing so might conflict with a state’s abortion restrictions.

Those conditions include severe bleeding, preeclampsia and certain pregnancy-related infections.

“For certain medical emergencies, abortion care is the necessary stabilizing treatment,” Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in an administration filing at the Supreme Court.

The state argued that the administration was misusing a law intended to prevent hospitals from dumping patients and imposing “a federal abortion mandate” on states. “EMTALA says nothing about abortion,” Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador told the court in a brief.

Just Tuesday, the federal appeals court in New Orleans came to the same conclusion as Labrador. A three-judge panel ruled that the administration cannot use EMTALA to require hospitals in Texas to provide abortions for women whose lives are at risk due to pregnancy. Two of the three judges are appointees of President Donald Trump, and the other was appointed by another Republican president, George W. Bush.

The appeals court affirmed a ruling by U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, also a Trump appointee. Hendrix wrote that adopting the Biden administration’s view would force physicians to place the health of the pregnant person over that of the fetus or embryo even though EMTALA “is silent as to abortion.”

After Winmill, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, issued his ruling, Idaho lawmakers won an order allowing the law to be fully enforced from an all-Republican, Trump-appointed panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But a larger contingent of 9th Circuit judges threw out the panel’s ruling and had set arguments in the case for late January.

The justices’ order Friday takes the case away from the appeals court. A decision is expected by early summer.

Friday’s development is just one of several legal battles currently making their way through the courts in Idaho.

Separately, four women and several physicians have filed a lawsuit asking an Idaho court to clarify the circumstances that qualify patients to legally receive an abortion. That lawsuit was recently granted the greenlight to move forward despite attempts by the Attorney General’s office to dismiss the case.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in November temporarily blocked Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” law from being enforced while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality is underway. That law, which Idaho lawmakers passed last year, was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don’t have their parents’ permission.

Nov 30 2023,Why a case in Texas on abortion exceptions is such a big deal,Mother Jones,left,https://motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/texas-abortion-ban-lawsuit-oral-arguments-life-of-the-mother,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

On Tuesday, the Supreme Court of Texas heard arguments in a suit brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights challenging the state’s abortion ban—the case could have ripple effects across the country as state courts wrestle with exceptions to abortion bans after the fall of Roe.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, representing 20 patients and two doctors, is asking the court to reconsider the medical exception language that currently exists in Texas’s abortion ban. The state’s law calls for “reasonable medical judgment” and permits abortion if the patient could die or if they’re at “serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The lawsuit argues this language is too vague and dangerous for pregnant people and providers.

The organization has brought similar suits in Tennessee, Idaho, and Oklahoma. But the Texas one marks the first time that directly impacted pregnant people have sued their state over a post-Roe law.

These challenges are drawing attention to the thin exceptions that have accompanied abortion-restrictive laws. Often referred to as “life of the mother” exceptions, they act as vague asterisks that tend to leave patients and providers confused, resulting in a diminished standard of care for pregnant people.

“While there is technically a medical exception to the bans,” Molly Duane, the senior attorney for the plaintiffs, said in the arguments this week, “no one knows what it means and the state won’t tell us.”

This past August, a district court judge ruled that the state’s near-total abortion ban could not be enforced in pregnancies with certain levels of complications, including those with lethal fetal diagnoses. Texas’ supreme court justices, all of whom are Republican, are deciding whether or not they will side with the state or uphold the lower court’s ruling. The latter would signal that challenges to unclear medical exceptions may work in the future.

Decisions about life-saving healthcare have become increasingly complex and uncertain since Roe was overturned—and even before then in Texas. The state’s six-week abortion ban dates back to 2021 and set a nationwide example for how to criminalize providers. The OB-GYNs in the Texas case have said that the state’s exception has led to “widespread confusion among the medical community” that left them and their colleagues unable to do their jobs well. And if providers misinterpret exceptions and perform abortions that do not fall under the rules, the stakes are high; medical professionals risk prison time, fines, and the potential loss of their licenses.

It’s unclear how much clarity the justices’ decision, which Duane expects this summer, will provide for pregnant people and medical teams across the state. Until then, more plaintiffs are coming forward to ask where their pregnancy story fits into the law.

Many of the plaintiffs bringing these cases across the country, including in Texas, wanted these pregnancies. Some long-dreamt of being parents only to face devastation when hearing of fetal anomalies or health complications during a regular check-up. The appointments in question usually take place after 18 weeks of pregnancy and abortion bans’ week-based cut-offs are often before that time. These circumstances leave pregnant people and their families with little time to mourn before figuring out how to move forward.

The women suing the state of Texas had to make these tough decisions, and quickly. Some left the state for abortion care, while others gave birth to babies who only lived for seconds. Others were told to wait until they were in graver danger before the hospital staff would provide care.

“Politicians in Texas are prohibiting healthcare that they don’t understand,” Lauren Miller, one of the original plaintiffs said at a news conference this spring. “They could do something. But they’re not. And it’s killing us.”"

If either bill survives the lengthy legislative process, those who undergo abortions could face criminal charges if they receive an abortion in Missouri.Titus told theno charges would be brought under his bill if people abide by the laws that were put in place upon Missouri's trigger law taking effect and banning abortion in the summer of 2022.Yet the bills, both called ""Abolition of Abortion in Missouri Act,"" would add much harsher enforcement to the existing abortion law , which allows only those who ""perform or induce"" a pregnancy to be charged with a class-B felony. Whether that includes someone inducing their own abortion has been a matter of debate , but the bills would make the law clear: Performing abortions would be unlawful for both patient and caregiver.Moon, a frequent flyer in the anti-abortion crusade, has filed similar bills in the last two years (see SB 699 and SB 356 ). All had the same name and none went further than a single hearing.The latest bills do provide exemptions for women under duress or procedures performed to save the live of the mother after all ""reasonable alternatives"" have been exhausted. As with current Missouri law, however, rape or incest are not exceptions.These pre-filed bills are just two of what will certainly be many GOP pushes as pro-choice advocates work to get abortion protection on state ballots in 2024.Two coalitions are pushing to put abortion protections in the state constitution. One, led by longtime GOP congressional staffer Jamie Corley, would add rape and incest exceptions to Missouri's near-total ban. The second, Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, has 11 initiative petitions on the books.Both would protect the right to abortion as well as birth control."
Dec 29 2023,Ada County District Court Judge Dismisses Claims Challenging Idaho’s Abortion Laws,KIFI News 8,center,https://localnews8.com/news/top-stories/2023/12/29/ada-county-district-court-judge-dismisses-claims-challenging-idahos-abortion-laws,"Boise, ID (Office of the Attorney General) – Today an Ada County District Court judge granted most of Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s Motion to Dismiss in Adkins v. State of Idaho, a challenge led by a New York-based advocacy group to Idaho’s criminal abortion laws. Judge Jason Scott dismissed the majority of claims in the suit, finding that Idaho’s criminal abortion laws do not violate the Idaho Constitution by treating pregnant women differently than those who are not pregnant and that the criminal abortion laws do not violate the Idaho Constitution relating to a physician’s right to practice medicine.



The judge also agreed with the Attorney General’s argument that the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Idaho Board of Medicine are not proper defendants in the case, given their limited and secondary roles in enforcing the statutes. Thus, the judge dismissed the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Idaho Board of Medicine from the lawsuit, and dismissed three of the five claims brought by the plaintiffs.



The judge allowed two limited claims to move forward against the State of Idaho. The judge decided the plaintiffs are entitled to have their rights declared under the statutes through a declaratory judgement, but with the admonishment that, “even though the declaration Plaintiffs ultimately receive may not be the one they want.” The judge is also allowing a limited challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes narrowly related to how the statutes might apply in specific pregnancy-related situations. The decision upholds the constitutionality of Idaho’s criminal abortion statutes in the vast majority of situations.



This is only the beginning of this litigation, but the Attorney General is encouraged by this ruling. He has long held that the named defendants were simply inappropriate, and that our legislatively passed laws do not violate the Idaho Constitution by narrowly limiting abortions or interfering with a doctor’s right to practice medicine. Attorney General Labrador will continue the fight to protect all Idahoans, including the unborn, and to uphold the laws passed by our legislature against special interest challenges."
Nov 16 2023,Abortion Rights Activists Launching Petition Drive,KLIN,center,https://klin.com/2023/11/16/290364,"A ballot initiative campaign that aims to protect the right to legal abortion access in Nebraska will officially kickoff on Thursday. Organizers with Protect Our Rights could be on the streets of Nebraska collecting signatures for reproductive rights by next week.

The goal is to collect 125,000 signatures in 36 counties by next summer in order to get the issues of protecting abortion rights on the November ballot. Organizers say the object of the petition drive is to amend the Nebraska Constitution to provide all persons the fundamental right to abortion without interference from the state or its political subdivisions until fetal viability.

Fetal viability is defined as the point in pregnancy where there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.

“Unlike the state officials working to totally ban abortion, we’re elevating the voices and lived experiences of Nebraskans who believe that pregnant people should be able to access needed care with compassion and privacy, free from political interference,” says Ashlei Spivey, a member of Protect Our Rights’ executive committee.

Opponents of the petition, including Nebraska Right to Life executive director Sandy Danek, say the ballot measure does not reflect the values of Nebraskans. “Nebraska’s law currently allows abortion throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but that isn’t enough for the abortion industry and activists who are trying to write second- and third-trimester abortions into our constitution. This amendment would allow for abortion until the moment of birth.”"
Nov 15 2023,Effort launched to protect abortion rights in Nebraska,Siouxland Proud,center,https://siouxlandproud.com/news/nebraska-news/effort-launched-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-nebraska,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — An effort to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution is being launched, following on the heels of successful efforts in other red states where Republicans had enacted or sought abortion restrictions.

Protect Our Rights, the coalition behind the effort, submitted proposed petition language to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office late last month.

That language was kept under wraps until Wednesday, when the state’s top elections office released it. Organizers plan to hold a news conference Thursday to kick off the effort, in which they will need to collect around 125,000 valid signatures by next summer to get the measure on the ballot in 2024.

“We’re confident in this effort, and we’re energized,” said Ashlei Spivey, founder and executive director of I Be Black Girl, an Omaha-based reproductive rights group that makes up part of the coalition. Other members include Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Women’s Fund.

The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Under the petition language, the patient’s health care practitioner would determine fetal viability.

The group relied, in part, on polling it says shows a majority of Nebraskans favoring abortion access, Spivey said. That’s proving consistent in other states where voters have backed abortion rights — including in Ohio, where voters last week resoundingly approved an amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion access.

“Ohio was definitely a proof point for us,” Spivey said. “Ohio shows that voters are going to protect their rights.”

Now, advocates in at least a dozen states are looking to take abortion questions to voters in 2024.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes neighboring conservative Kansas, where voters resoundingly rejected last year a ballot measure that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.

Paige Brown, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Catholic Conference that has lobbied hard for abortion restrictions, telegraphed that abortion opponents are aware of the public pushback.

“Nebraska’s major pro-life groups are not pursuing our own ballot initiative,” Brown said in a written statement. Instead, she said, they will focus on defending Nebraska’s current 12-week abortion ban passed by the Republican-led Legislature earlier this year that includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.

“The vast majority of Nebraskans agree this is reasonable public policy,” Brown said.

A petition seeking a 2024 referendum to outright ban abortion in Nebraska that was approved earlier this year has been suspended after the lone organizer was unable to raise enough volunteers to circulate it.

Despite indications that further restrictions are unpopular, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and other Republican leaders have vowed to do just that, even as others have warned it could cost them elections. Republican state Sen. Merve Riepe, who tanked a 6-week ban bill by refusing to end a filibuster on it, took to the legislative floor in April to urge his conservative colleagues to heed signs that abortion will galvanize women to vote them out of office.

“We must embrace the future of reproductive rights,” he said at the time.

Ashley All, who helped lead the effort in Kansas to protect abortion rights, echoed that warning, noting Kansas voters rejected that state’s anti-abortion effort by nearly 20 percentage points.

“For 50 years, all we’ve heard is a very specific stereotype of who gets an abortion and why,” All said. “But when you start to disrupt that stereotype and show how abortion is health care, people’s perceptions and opinions begin to shift.”"

Nov 15 2023,Oklahoma Supreme Court blocks abortion restrictions,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/oklahoma-supreme-court-blocks-abortion-restrictions,"

The Oklahoma Supreme Court placed temporary injunctions on three laws regulating abortion and abortion pills on Tuesday, signaling that the state’s high court could soon weigh whether abortion rights are implied in the state constitution.

In October 2021, reproductive rights groups filed a suit against five bills from the state legislature restricting access to and regulating abortion procedures, saying that all five laws violated the due process clause of the Oklahoma Constitution.

CUSTOMERS SURPRISED TO DISCOVER THEIR RENTAL IS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE

At the time, the Oklahoma County District Court issued a temporary injunction against two of the five laws but allowed three to stand: House Bill 1904 and Senate Bills 778 and 779.

On Tuesday, the state’s highest court ruled in a 5-4 decision to grant a temporary injunction on the remaining three pieces of legislation.

Oklahoma HB 1904 requires that any in-person clinic abortion procedure must be performed by a board-certified OB-GYN, while SB 778 requires that abortion pills be prescribed by an OB-GYN. SB 779 requires that the Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy track the manufacturing and distribution data of abortion pills.

Associate Justice Douglas Combs wrote in the majority opinion that following the logic of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case overturning federal abortion rights would require the state court to “find [that] a limited right to terminate a pregnancy was deeply rooted in Oklahoma’s history and tradition.”

Combs added that abortion had been outlawed in Oklahoma until the Roe v. Wade decision, but even criminal statutes “provided a limited exception to allow an abortion if [it] was ‘necessary to preserve her life.'”

The Center for Reproductive Rights, a plaintiff in the original suit, told the Washington Examiner that the organization is “grateful that the Oklahoma Supreme Court recognized how these laws are medically baseless and threaten grave harm, while ensuring that they remain blocked as this case proceeds.”

“This is welcome news, but the devastating reality is that Oklahomans still do not have access to the abortion care they need. The right to abortion is a human right, and Oklahomans deserve to access such essential healthcare without barriers,” Rabia Muqaddam, senior staff attorney for the organization, said in a statement.

With the exception of saving the mother’s life, abortion has been completely banned in Oklahoma since May 2022, after an unauthorized copy of the Dobbs decision was leaked to the public.

In November 2022, Oklahomans struck down a ballot initiative amendment that explicitly denied a state constitutional right to an abortion, opening a legal avenue to protect the procedure.

Abortion rights advocates in the state say that Oklahoma has some of the worst maternal death rates in the United States, with 47.5 maternal deaths per 100,000 — 14.5 deaths higher than the national average.

Dec 07 2023,Texas judge grants pregnant woman's request to get an abortion,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/news/us-news/pregnant-woman-texas-gets-court-order-abortion-rcna128537,"A Texas judge on Thursday granted an emergency order allowing a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis to get an abortion in the state.

Late last month, Kate Cox, a 31-year-old Dallas-area mother of two who is about 20 weeks pregnant, found out that her developing fetus has trisomy 18, a rare chromosomal disorder likely to cause stillbirth or the death of the baby shortly after it’s born.

Cox told NBC News on Thursday afternoon that she was “hopeful” and grateful after the judge’s decision.

“I feel like I’ll be able to get the medical care that I need and will take time to heal, and then I want to try again,” she said.

Texas law prohibits almost all abortions with limited exceptions. So on behalf of Cox, her husband and her doctor, lawyers with the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a request for a temporary restraining order that would block the state’s abortion bans in Cox's case and enable her to terminate her pregnancy.

""Kate Cox’s life and future fertility are at great risk, and according to her doctor, the medical care that she needs is an abortion,"" Molly Duane, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in the hearing Thursday.

Cox’s two children were delivered by cesarean section, so carrying this pregnancy to term and getting a third C-section could put her at risk for multiple serious medical issues, Duane said.

Cox said in the interview that she and her husband want to have a third child and “never imagined that we would be in this position.”

She said she felt that being forced to continue the pregnancy, with “the pain and suffering” and risks that go along with it, “I think it’s cruel.”

“I really would love another baby,” she said. “So, I’m hopeful for my health, our family.”

During the hearing, Duane argued that Cox was ""at high risk for multiple pregnancy complications, including hypertension, gestational diabetes and infection,"" and said that within the last two days, Cox had to visit an emergency room for a fourth time ""for pregnancy symptoms including severe cramps, leaking fluid and elevated vital signs.""

""Many of Miss Cox’s health risks during this pregnancy will put her life in danger if left untreated, and carrying this pregnancy to term will significantly increase the risks to her future fertility, meaning that she and her husband may not be able to have more children in the future,"" Duane said.

State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble quickly granted the requested order, which also allows Cox’s doctor to perform the abortion without fear of prosecution by the state.

""The idea that Miss Cox wants desperately to be a parent and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" the judge said.

Johnathan Stone, an attorney with the Texas attorney general's office who represented the state in the hearing, argued that Cox and her husband had not sufficiently demonstrated that they would suffer ""immediate and irreparable injury"" without an abortion.

""The only party that’s going to suffer an immediate and irreparable harm"" if the judge grants the requested order, he said, ""is the state.""

Stone pushed instead for an evidentiary hearing, saying an emergency order would lead the couple to get an abortion that ""can’t be undone"" before the court could fully consider the evidence.

On Friday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the Texas Supreme Court to issue an emergency stay to block the judge’s order.

In a statement Thursday afternoon, Paxton also said that the judge’s order ""will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws. This includes first degree felony prosecutions.""

It also does not prohibit private citizens or a district or county attorney from enforcing Texas’ pre-Roe abortion laws against Cox's doctor or anyone else, Paxton argued, adding that the judge’s order ""will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires.""

In a letter to three Texas hospitals where Cox's doctor has practiced, Paxton warned that the facilities could be found liable for negligently credentialing her or for failing to exercise appropriate professional judgment in allowing the doctor to perform an abortion.

One of those hospitals, the Woman’s Hospital of Texas said in a statement to NBC News on Friday that it was monitoring the evolving lawsuit, a second hospital said it is not involved in the case, and a third did not respond to a request for comment.

In response, Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that ""fearmongering has been Ken Paxton’s main tactic in enforcing these abortion bans"" and that he ""is misrepresenting the court’s order.""

In an earlier news conference, Duane said ""every day of this ordeal has been agonizing"" for Cox.

""I want to emphasize how unforgivable it is that Kate had to beg for health care in court. No one should have to do this,"" she said. ""The reality is that 99% of people cannot.""

Duane also called the state's arguments ""callous in the extreme.""

""They want Kate to suffer, to put her health at risk and to give birth to a stillborn baby or be forced to watch her child suffer for the few short moments of her life,"" she said. ""That is a decision that only a family should be able to make on their own.""

Trisomy 18, a severe genetic condition, occurs when a fetus has an extra copy of chromosome 18. The anomaly is random, occurring in around 1 out of every 2,500 pregnancies, according to the Cleveland Clinic. At least 95% of fetuses with the condition don’t survive to full term, meaning pregnancies end in miscarriage or babies are stillborn. Infants born with trisomy 18 have many birth defects, which can cause life-threatening consequences. Almost 40% don’t survive labor, and less than 10% live past their first year.

Since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022, more than a dozen states have banned abortion or no longer have facilities where women can receive the procedure.

In another lawsuit in Texas, the Center for Reproductive Rights sued on behalf of two OB-GYNs and 20 women who were denied abortions ""while experiencing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications,"" according to the center.

That case seeks to clarify which situations qualify for medical exceptions under Texas' abortion laws. The state Supreme Court heard arguments last week, after a lower court issued a ruling in the plaintiffs' favor that blocked Texas' bans from applying in situations like theirs.

Cox's case, though, is one of the first of its kind — very few pregnant women have sought emergency court orders to receive an abortion.

Duane said after the hearing that for many people, traveling out of state for an abortion, especially during a medical emergency, isn't an option.

""Kate wants to be able to receive health care in her own community and a place that she feels comfortable,"" Duane added. ""She’s a lifelong Texan, her whole family lives here."""
Dec 07 2023,Hearing Thursday for woman suing Texas over abortion ban,KXAN News,not-yet-rated,https://kxan.com/news/texas-politics/hearing-thursday-for-woman-suing-texas-over-abortion-ban,"AUSTIN (Nexstar) — A Travis County judge granted an emergency request to allow a Texas woman to seek an abortion. Judge Maya Guerra Gamble announced the decision after a hearing Thursday morning.

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two young children in Dallas, filed suit against the state last week. Cox is pregnant, and said a screening revealed her baby has full trisomy 18 — a fatal chromosomal condition causing deformities and growth delays in fetal development. Babies with trisomy 18 are often stillborn or survive for only minutes or days, and their mothers are often at risk of losing the chance to have another child, the petition states.

“It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye, but when. I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy,” Cox said in a petition to a Travis County district court. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer a heart attack or suffocation. I desperately want the chance to try for another baby and want to access the medical care now that gives me the best chance at another baby.”

According to the petition, Cox’s physicians told her their “hands are tied” because of Texas’ abortion bans.

“She will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death,” the petition states.

Cox is now suing the state of Texas with her husband and physician for emergency abortion care. They are asking the court to declare that the abortion bans are unconstitutional when applied to pregnant people with emergency medical conditions.

The decision came after a virtual hearing in Travis County’s 459th District Court.

Lawyers representing the State of Texas argued against granting a temporary restraining order, or TRO. Attorney Johnathan Stone said allowing Cox to get an abortion amounted to a permanent decision.

“The abortion once performed is permanent. It can’t be undone,” Stone told the judge.

Texas Right to Life accuses the suit of “seek[ing] to conflate two separate issues: the risk to the mother and the child’s disability.” They argue a baby with trisomy 18 should be born and live until natural death.

“Ms. Cox’s story is heartbreaking because all of us recognize that she and her child are equally valuable and loved by God,” Texas Right to Life Communications Director Kimberly Schwartz said. “If you feel compassion for this situation like us, it is because we all know that there are two lives at stake and that both are supremely important. The answer is not to end the child’s life because of the baby’s disability, but state law does anticipate the serious risk to the mother.”

Cox’s suit aligns closely with Zurawski v. Texas, another challenge to Texas’ abortion ban seeking clarification to the law’s medical exceptions. In that case, 20 women — many of whom nearly died due to pregnancy complications — argued in front of the Texas Supreme Court that the law does not give proper deference to a doctor’s good-faith medical judgment.

The Center for Reproductive Rights is leading both cases. Dr. Damla Karsan, an OB-GYN in Houston, is a plaintiff in both. She is suing for the right to use perform abortions when she deems them medically necessary.

“In Dr. Karsan’s experience, widespread fear and confusion regarding the scope of Texas’s abortion bans have chilled the provision of necessary obstetric care, including abortion care,” the petition states.

Kate Cox’s husband, Justin Cox, is also a plaintiff in the suit. The petition states he “hopes to assist his wife in obtaining the abortion,” but he fears retribution under Senate Bill 8, which subjects him to civil liability."

Updated Thursday, Dec. 7 at 1:55 p.m.

""Kate Cox needs an abortion, and she needs it now."" Thus began a petition filed in a Texas district court this week, asking a judge to allow the abortion to be performed in the state, where abortion is banned with very limited exceptions.

On Thursday, Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County, Texas, ruled from the bench, granting permission for Cox to have the abortion she is seeking. Cox's fetus has a genetic condition with very low chances of survival and her own health and fertility are at risk if she carries the pregnancy to term.

The petition was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is the group behind a high profile case heard at the Texas Supreme Court last week.

In that case the group's senior staff attorney Molly Duane argued on behalf of 20 patients and two OB-GYNs that the medical exception to the ban on abortion in the state's laws is too narrow and vague, and that it endangered patients during complicated pregnancies. An attorney for the state argued the exception is already clear and that the plaintiffs didn't have standing to sue.

On the very day of those arguments, Nov. 28, Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two who lives in the Dallas area, got ""devastating"" news about her pregnancy, the filing says. At nearly 20-weeks gestation, she learned that her fetus has Trisomy 18 or Edwards Syndrome, a condition with extremely low chances of survival.

So, as the Texas Supreme Court considered whether its abortion laws endangered patients with pregnancy complications in the past, Cox was trying to figure out what to do in her present situation.

""When she Googled what to do and – where can I find help? – news about our case popped up,"" Duane tells NPR.

Cox had already been in the emergency room three times with cramping and other concerning symptoms, according to court documents. Her doctors told her she was at high risk of developing gestational hypertension and diabetes, and because she had had two prior cesarean sections, carrying the pregnancy to term could compromise her chances of having a third child in the future, the brief says.

Last Thursday, she reached out for the Center for Reproductive Rights. Five days after that, the group filed this petition on her behalf.

A quick decision

The filing asked a Travis County district court for a temporary restraining order against the state of Texas and the Texas Medical Board, blocking enforcement of Texas's abortion bans so that Cox can terminate her current pregnancy. It also would block enforcement of S.B. 8, which allows civil lawsuits to be filed against those who help patients receive abortions.

That would protect the other plaintiffs in the case, Cox's husband, Justin, and Dr. Damla Karsan, who is prepared to provide the abortion if the court grants their request. Karsan is one of the OB-GYN plaintiffs in the Zurawski v. the State of Texas case.

Thursday's ruling will allow Karsan to provide an abortion without threat of prosecution. It only applies to Cox, her husband and Karsan. Issuing the ruling, Judge Guerra Gamble said: ""The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice.""

There are currently three overlapping abortion bans in Texas. Abortion is illegal in the state from the moment pregnancy begins. Texas doctors can legally provide abortions only if a patient is ""in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function, "" the law says.

""I don't know what that means,"" Duane says of the language of the medical exception. ""But I think [Cox's] situation must fall within whatever it is that that means.""

The Texas Attorney General's office did not respond to a request for comment on Cox's case, but the office argued in the Zurawski case that the medical exception needs no clarification.

Texas Alliance for Life, a group that lobbied in the state legislature for the current abortion laws, published a statement about Cox's case Wednesday. ""We believe that the exception language in Texas laws is clear,"" wrote the group's communication director Amy O'Donnell, and accused the Center for Reproductive Rights of pretending to seek clarity while really attempting to ""chisel away"" at Texas's abortion laws.

The timeline of this case was very quick. ""I have to be honest, I've never done this before, and that's because no one's ever done this before,"" Duane says. ""But usually when you ask for a temporary restraining order, the court will act very, very quickly in acknowledgement of the emergency circumstances.""

The hearing was held via Zoom on Thursday morning.

The State of Texas cannot appeal the decision directly, says Duane. ""They would have to file what's called a writ of mandamus, saying that the district court acted so far out of its jurisdiction and that there needs to be a reversal,"" Duane explains. ""But filing a petition like that is not does not automatically stay the injunction the way that an appeal of a temporary injunction does.""

In the meantime, the justices of the Texas Supreme Court are considering the Zurawski case, with a decision expected in the next few months. ""I want them to take their time to write an opinion that gets this right and will protect patients, doctors and their families going forward,"" Duane says.

""But the reality is that in the meantime, people are going to continue to be harmed,"" and Cox couldn't afford to wait for that decision, Duane says.

Duane praises Cox for her bravery in publicly sharing her story while in the midst of a personal medical crisis. ""She's exceptional – but I will also say that the pathway to this has been paved by all the other women in our lawsuit,"" she says. ""There is strength in numbers."""

Dec 05 2023,NH Republicans Introduce 15-Day Abortion Ban Bill,JoeMyGod,left,https://joemygod.com/2023/12/nh-republicans-introduce-15-day-abortion-ban-bill,"The Huffington Post reports

Republicans in New Hampshire filed one of the most extreme abortion bans in the country on Tuesday ― and a GOP trifecta could allow the bill to become law once the legislature starts its 2024 session next month.

The bill was pre-filed in the House in September, but the full text of the abortion ban was only released Tuesday morning. The legislation “prohibits abortion, other than for a medical emergency, if the gestational age of the fetus is more than 15 days,” according to the bill text.

The main sponsor, state Rep. Dave Testerman (R), introduced several anti-choice bills last legislative session, including a ban on abortion once fetal cardiac activity is detected."
Dec 05 2023,Tuberville Relents in Pentagon Abortion Fight after GOP Backstabbing,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/12/05/tuberville-relents-in-pentagon-abortion-fight-after-republicans-scheme-with-schumer-to-change-senate-rules,"Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) has relented in his almost year-long fight against the Biden Administration Pentagon policy to subsidize abortions widely viewed to be illegal.

Tuberville’s holds were in protest of a Department of Defense policy imposed after Roe v. Wade was overturned that pays travel costs and provides other benefits for military members traveling outside of the state in which they are stationed to receive an abortion.

“It’s been a long fight,” Coach Tuberville told a gaggle of reporters after meeting with his Senate Republican colleagues. “We fought hard. We did the right thing for the unborn and for our military, fighting back against executive overreach and an abortion policy that’s not legal.”

Tuberville has used his prerogative as a senator to block hundreds of military nominations from moving forward lumped together without debate or individual consideration. That “en blanc” mass passage technically is against Senate rules, but Senate rules are routinely violated by “unanimous consent” to effectively allow legislation, nominations, and other Senate business to proceed without debate or to bypass time constraints.

The tactic is also often used to avoid contentious floor votes and debates.

“I’ve been standing up for the people in Alabama,” he said. “And so it’s just unfortunate, the only opportunity you have in the minority in the Senate is to put a hold on something.”

EXCLUSIVE: Sen. Tommy Tuberville Scores a Win Against Pentagon-Funded Abortion

Tuberville has argued that — the Pentagon’s abortion policies notwithstanding — the Senate should do its job to vet these nominees. “The way our military is today, our top, top leaders need to be vetted, just like everybody else, need to be vetted. We need to know who they are and why they’re making all the decisions of our military.”

Throughout Tuberville’s holds, the Senate has maintained the ability to consider each nominee individually. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) chose not to do so despite the Senate holding few votes and accomplishing little legislatively in 2023.

The Senate has only passed three of the twelve government funding bills for the fiscal year that began in September.

The Alabamian argues Schumer withheld a path to promote Pentagon nominees not because of time constraints but to prevent a vote to authorize the Biden administration’s unilateral change of abortion policy. He called the situation “a two-way street. Schumer held these promotions up for the last year basically because he was not going to give into an illegal policy.”

Tuberville only changed his tactics after Schumer, with the backing of a block of neoconservative Senate Republicans, prepared to change the rules of the Senate to circumvent Tuberville’s holds.

By going along with the Schumer plan, Republican and Democrat senators were prepared to cede much of their Senatorial authority — presumably given to them to advocate for their constituents — to the majority leader, with the promise from Schumer that it would be in good hands.

Tuberville relented to prevent senators from having their ability to do their jobs stripped from them and given to Schumer.

“When you change the rules, it’s hard to beat somebody,” Tuberville said. “I’d have loved to have five downs in football instead of four. But you can’t do it.”

Under Tuberville’s new policy, he will release his holds on “everybody but the ten or eleven four stars. Those will continue to have a hold. And we’re gonna have Senator Schumer to bring up one at a time.”

Tuberville remained gracious throughout his fight despite months of disparaging comments from his Republican colleagues about his tactics and intentions. Sens. Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Joni Ernst (R-IO), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Mitt Romney (R-UT), and Todd Young (R-IO) took to the Senate floor on November 1 to lambast Tuberville in emotional attacks that veered towards the personal.

EXCLUSIVE: Tuberville Warns GOP Senators Not to Side with Democrats on Abortion

“He fought the good fight here,” said a senior GOP aide to Breitbart News about Tuberville. “There were too many senators who care more about making defense contractors happy than they do about unborn Americans. How many of them are going to brag about this when the March for Life comes to town again next month?”

By relenting, Tuberville has assured — for now— that no Senate rules changes will take place to take away a senator’s powers. “We’re all together in our caucus that nobody, it’ll be a hundred percent, will vote against any standing order that would change the rules of the Senate for these holds,” he said.

Tuberville is hoping the visibility he gave the Pentagon’s abortion policy will give House Republicans needed backup in ongoing negotiating in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference committee with the Schumer-led Senate. The NDAA the House passed earlier in 2023 included language returning the Pentagon to a decades-held policy preventing taxpayer funding for abortions, including for travel to another state and subsidized time off to receive an abortion.

“We’re still counting on possibly the House [negotiating for] the language in the NDAA,” he said.

Tuberville maintained that Schumer and the Democrats could have easily prevented a backlog of holds but acted out of political interests. “The Democrats are for pro-choice, and they could [not] care less about the military,” he insisted.

“Just goes to show you what we went through. They could have promoted these people a long time ago, but because of the illegal policy that they pushed on the American people… we had a lot of people that did not get promoted.”

But Tuberville said he has no regrets.

“You got to stick with what you believe,” he said with a smile.

Dec 05 2023,New Hampshire proposal would amore protections against abortion,World Magazine,right,https://wng.org/sift/new-hampshire-to-pose-bill-with-more-protections-against-abortion-1701801655,"Republican representatives in the state House pre-filed a bill protecting unborn children from abortion after 15 days of gestation. Under the Fetal Life Protection Act, abortion past two weeks would only be legal if a mother’s life were at risk or the baby was at risk for “abnormalities incompatible with life.” The current New Hampshire law, enacted in 2022, protects a child after 24 weeks of gestation. Anyone knowingly violating the proposed bill would be charged with a felony and fined up to $100,000.



What’s the bill’s reception? Democrats are already pushing against the bill before it is even formally proposed. State Rep. Alexis Simpson, D-N.H., described the legislation as “absurd,” saying the bill must be “completely renounced.” Republican Governor Chris Sununu has not indicated his stance on the pre-filed legislation. Sununu signed the latest 24-week protection into law while also describing himself as “pro-choice” and promising to protect state access to abortion.

Dec 05 2023,New Hampshire Republicans propose '15-day' abortion ban,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/new-hampshire-republicans-propose-15-day-abortion-ban-rcna128092,"Four Republican legislators in New Hampshire will introduce a bill that would ban abortion at “15 days"" gestational age, according to a copy of the bill they prefiled.

The bill, which is unlikely to pass, amounts to an outright abortion ban. Gestational age is calculated from the first day of the woman’s period; at 15 days gestational age, a fertilized egg — if it exists yet — has most likely not implanted in the uterine wall. Implantation is the point when pregnancy begins, according to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

Doctors often estimate that women ovulate around two weeks after their period begins — at about 14 days gestational age — and fertilization is thought to occur shortly afterward, though these times vary. A fertilized egg is nonviable until it implants on the uterine wall, which is thought to typically occur a week or more after fertilization.

The bill is the latest in a string of abortion restrictions Republicans have pursued since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion last year. More than a dozen states have banned abortion completely or do not have facilities where people can obtain an abortion, NBC News reported this year.

New Hampshire currently restricts abortion after 24 weeks, except in cases of fatal fetal abnormalities or in certain circumstances to preserve the life and health of the mother. The proposed bill maintains those same exceptions.

New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican who signed the 24-week ban into law, has promised to protect access to abortion and called himself “pro-choice.”

State Rep. John Sellers, a Republican co-sponsor of the bill, said he wasn't sure why the bill's author had targeted 15 days, but said he would support any restriction on abortion.

""I believe life begins at conception,"" he said, pointing to fertilization.

State Democrats slammed the bill.

""In a state where voters overwhelmingly believe that reproductive health decisions should be made solely between patient and medical provider, this legislation is absurd. Stopping this bill isn't enough; it must be completely renounced,"" said state Rep. Alexis Simpson."
Nov 24 2023,Nevada Judge Nixes Abortion Rights Ballot Initiative,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/nevada-abortion-constitution/2023/11/24/id/1143570,"A petition to put an abortion rights amendment to the Nevada constitution on the ballot for 2024 was struck down on Tuesday by district court judge in Carson City.

The petition was brought by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom to enshrine abortion rights into the constitution with a public ballot question. Calling the petition too broad, District Court Judge James Russell ruled the document contained ""too many subjects.""

""It is clear to me this is probably the clearest case I have seen that I think there is a violation of the single-subject rule,"" Russell's ruling stated, according to KOLO. ""I just, I've seen a lot of them over the years. And in respect to this particular matter, there are too many subjects — not all of which are functionally related to each other.""

The Associated Press reported that the proposed amendment would amend the state constitution to include a ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom,"" including abortion, abortion care, prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, vasectomy, tubal ligation, and birth control, if passed by voters in the 2024 elections.

The measure was opposed in court by the Coalition for Parents and Children, a pro-life organization that argued the measure contained more than one subject, running afoul of Nevada law regulating what a petition could include.

Coalition representative Jason Guinasso argued that the proposed amendment would also protect the care providers and end up as an ""unfunded mandate"" for Nevada taxpayers.

""This initiative clearly violated the statue with regards to the kinds of initiatives that should be presented to the public so we can have an open and transparent debate,"" Guinasso told the station.

Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom along with allies Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union said it will appeal the decision to the state supreme court.

""We are optimistic about the ballot initiative as a whole; and, you know, we plan to appeal this,"" said Lindsey Harmon with Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom. ""And we know that, in fact, these are all a single subject.""

In order to move forward, the supreme court needs to overturn the lower court's ruling and the petition must get 100,000 signatures in the state by June to appear on the ballot. It would need to pass in both 2024 and 2026 to become part of the stare constitution, the report said."
Dec 13 2023,New Mexico Supreme Court to decide fate of local abortion restrictions,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/new-mexico-supreme-court-decide-fate-local-abortion-restrictions,"The New Mexico Supreme Court is weighing whether to strike down local abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties at the request of the attorney general for the state where abortion laws are among the most liberal in the country.

Oral arguments were scheduled for Wednesday in Santa Fe. At least four state supreme courts are grappling with abortion litigation this week in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to rescind the constitutional right to abortion.

In New Mexico's Lea and Roosevelt counties and the cities of Hobbs and Clovis, where opposition to abortion runs deep, officials argue that local governments have the right to back federal abortion restrictions under a 19th century U.S. law that prohibits the shipping of abortion medication and supplies. They say the local abortion ordinances can't be struck down until federal courts rule on the meaning of provision within the ""anti-vice"" law known as the Comstock Act.

NEW MEXICO SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ARGUMENTS IN CHALLENGE TO ABORTION-BAN ORDINANCES

Attorney General Raúl Torrez has argued that the recently enacted local laws violate state constitutional guarantees — including New Mexico’s equal rights amendment that prohibits discrimination based on sex or being pregnant.

Since the court case began, additional local ordinances have been adopted to restrict abortion near Albuquerque and along the state line with Texas.

New Mexico is among seven states that allow abortions up until birth, and it has become a major destination for people from other states with bans, especially Texas, who are seeking procedures.

A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.

NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES ADOPT NEW ABORTION BAN ORDINANCES

In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the U.S. Supreme Court rolled back guarantees last year.

Earlier this year, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from investigations by other states.

On Tuesday, the Arizona Supreme Court grilled lawyers about a pre-statehood ban in 1864 on nearly all abortions and whether it has been limited or made moot by other statutes enacted over the past 50 years.

Arizona's high court is reviewing a lower-court decision that said doctors couldn’t be charged for performing the procedure in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy because other, more recent laws have allowed them to provide abortions."

This law originally stated that minors were legally not permitted to leave the state and get an abortion without the permission of their legal guardians, since abortions are illegal in Idaho. If anyone else takes the child out of Idaho yo get an abortion without permission they will get charged with a felony.

Two advocacy groups, the Northwest Abortion Access Fund and Indigenous Idaho Alliance sued the state of Idaho and the states Attorney General, Raúl Labrador. They stated that the law violated their First Amendment regarding freedom of speech and their Fourth Amendment to travel between states. Judge Grasham accepted their claims to go forward.

In an important victory for abortion access in the Midwest, a Kansas judge ruled against a handful of stringent anti-abortion measures—some of which trace back decades under the insidiously named Women’s Right to Know Act while others were passed after the fall of Roe v. Wade.

“The Act appears to be a thinly veiled effort to stigmatize the procedure and instill fear in patients that are contemplating an abortion, such that they make an alternative choice, based upon disproven and unsupportable claims,” Johnson County District Court Judge Krishnan Christopher Jayaram wrote on Monday. As requested in the lawsuit filed by abortion providers in the state, Jayaram issued a temporary injunction on these restrictions until a trial set for 2024.

The measures in question required that—on top of a 24-hour waiting period that’s particularly onerous for the state’s many out-of-state abortion seekers from nearby states that have banned abortion—patients receive a range of inaccurate state-mandated information in order to have an abortion. This includes the medically unfounded statements that abortion creates a “risk of premature birth in future pregnancies” and a “risk of breast cancer.” Doctors would also be required to present abortion-seeking patients no fewer than five times with the medically unfounded claim that a medication abortion that’s underway can be “reversed” through a possibly dangerous chemical regimen.

Other requirements presented uniquely onerous barriers, including that abortion seekers must receive state-mandated abortion misinformation in forms written in specific typeface, font size, and color at least 24 hours before an abortion appointment in order to receive care. Then, upon coming into the clinic, they’re required to wait 30 minutes after meeting the abortion provider to receive abortion care. Jayaram struck down all of these measures.

In his ruling, the judge also recognized the restrictions as a violation of abortion providers’ right to free speech as well as patients’ fundamental right to abortion access.

Ever since the state Supreme Court interpreted the Kansas state constitution’s right to bodily autonomy to include abortion in 2019, the state constitution recognizes the right to abortion. Last August, Kansas voters overwhelmingly voted to uphold this right in a special election over a ballot measure that was written by abortion rights opponents seeking to eliminate this constitutional protection and enact an abortion ban. Kansas was the first state in the nation to vote directly on abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe; but while the state maintains a constitutional right to abortion, the state can continue to pass restrictions.

In a statement shared with Jezebel, Alice Wang, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights who worked on the case, criticized the “paternalistic restrictions” of the Women’s Right to Know Act. “These restrictions are especially harmful now that Roe was overturned and Kansas clinics are overwhelmed with patients from neighboring states where abortion is banned. Abortion is a human right and Kansans deserve accurate, candid medical information.”

After Roe fell, three of Kansas’ neighboring states—Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Missouri—moved to ban abortion. Bloomberg estimated at the time that Kansas could see a “quadrupling” of abortion patients in post-Roe America. One clinic that’s involved in the lawsuit against the aforementioned restrictions reported that it’s seen a 40% increase in patients since the overturning of Roe, and close to two-thirds of their patients have traveled more than 100 miles to get care. The Trust Women clinic in Kansas told Jezebel last year that the state had “become a majority out-of-state provider” and the clinic received as many as 1,000 calls on some days. The Guardian now reports that Trust Women says it sees between double and triple the patients it saw before Roe fell, and 70% of its patients come from out-of-state.

In a statement shared with Jezebel, Planned Parenthood Great Plains president and CEO Emily Wales emphasized how infringements on abortion access for Kansans impact abortion seekers across the entire region. Wales called the ruling against these measures “a crucial step in achieving what Kansans emphatically supported in August 2022: abortion access without political interference,” adding that “no patient should be denied care because they printed a form in the wrong color.”"

Paige Jordae, who has 418,000 followers on Instagram, where she posts racy photos of herself, reportedly posted screenshots of the messages she says Edwards sent her pressuring her to get an abortion, according to the New York Post.

Anthony Edwards addresses $100,000 abortion texts with Instagram model: ‘Heat of a moment’ https://t.co/5aIKRUl91f pic.twitter.com/Okw6vhpu2b — New York Post (@nypost) December 18, 2023

Since Jordae went public with the alleged spat, Edwards has posted a message apologizing for his behavior and promising to do better.

“I made comments in the heat of a moment that are not me, and that are not aligned with what I believe and who I want to be as a man,” Edwards wrote in a statement posted on X.

“All women should be supported and empowered to make their own decisions about their bodies and what is best for them,” he said, concluding with, “I am handling my personal matters privately and will not be commenting on them any further at this time.”

Edwards had been linked to an ongoing romance with girlfriend Jeanine Robel.

But in the screenshots Jordae posted to her Instagram stories, Edwards supposedly sent her $100,000 to get an abortion, sent several messages telling her to take “the pill” and prove it by showing him the box the pill came in, and threatened her with legal action unless she got rid of the baby.

Jordae, who also seems to have appeared in porn videos, said Edwards sent messages including: “I don’t want a kid,” “Just take the pills,” and “Ok just make sure I get da video of the box wit the right pills.”

In another message, he supposedly wrote, “You got da money wats the hol up” and “my attorney gone handle it.”

For her part, the model blasted Edwards in one of her Instagram stories.

“I’ve never once ran to the internet about NO ONE,” she wrote. “I tried over and over to handle this privately and my efforts were ignored.”

“I’ve been lied to and manipulated by someone who knows exactly what they’re doing and takes no accountability for anything.

“Y’all always want someone to blame and I guess it’s going to be me.”

The Timberwolves have not yet commented on the situation.

More of Kentucky Lanterns work can be found at kentuckylantern.com. Follow them on Facebook and Twitter.

A Kentucky woman who is pregnant but does not want to be is suing Attorney General Daniel Cameron and others in Jefferson County Circuit Court to challenge the states near-total abortion bans, the first lawsuit of its kind in Kentucky.

The woman, identified only as Jane Doe, said in a statement, I am angry that now that I am pregnant and do not want to be, the government is interfering in my private matters and blocking me from having an abortion.

Doe, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union in her class action lawsuit, is eight weeks pregnant, according to the court filing. She seeks to terminate her pregnancy in the Commonwealth but cannot legally do so.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which gave Americans the constitutional right to abortion, in 2022, a trigger law went into effect in Kentucky that banned abortions. Another law bans abortions after six weeks. Kentucky does not have exceptions for rape or incest. Lawyers for this case are asking that the states bans be ruled unconstitutional.

At this moment, Jane Doe and the other putative and future class members, are suffering medical, constitutional, and irreparable harm because they are denied the ability to obtain an abortion, the lawsuit states. It argues that the bans violate Does right to self-determination, as well as the autonomy of others like her.

This lawsuit is historic for Kentucky, said Amber Duke, executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky. Nationally, though, cases like this are not new.

Even before Roe vs. Wade was overturned we did bring class action lawsuits on behalf of individuals, often in the context of people who were pregnant and seeking abortion when they were in government custody, said Brigitte Amiri, a deputy director at the ACLUs Reproductive Freedom Project.

During an afternoon press conference to discuss the lawsuit, ACLUs Duke said the fallout from abortion bans in Kentucky has been ""devastating, leaving thousands of Kentuckians to manage life altering consequences and serious health risks over the past year..

Rebecca Gibron, CEO of Planned Parenthood Kentucky and other states, said abortion bans have nothing to do with health and well being and everything to do with power and control.

Both Duke and Gibron pointed to a special election in 2022 in which Kentucky voters defeated the anti-abortion Amendment 2, which would have specified theres no right to an abortion in Kentuckys Constitution.

Because of that vote, Duke said: We know that Kentuckians support access to legal, safe abortion care without government interference.

In a statement, Doe said she hopes this case will restore abortion access in Kentucky, if not for me then for the countless people in the future who deserve the autonomy to decide what is best for themselves and their families."

As has become a predictable tradition, the national media’s coverage previewing yesterday’s state elections emphasized how they could be a harbinger of what’s to come in next year’s presidential contest. Various races were described as a “national litmus test” or a “preview of 2024”—and while off-year elections can be over-analyzed, last night delivered a clear takeaway: Abortion remains a winner for Democrats at the ballot box and a liability for Republicans.

Following a run of state-level victories for abortion access in Kansas, Kentucky, Wisconsin, and Michigan, Democrats continued that streak yesterday in state elections and ballot initiatives across the country. Ohio voters passed an amendment enshrining abortion rights into their state constitution, and though abortion wasn’t directly on the ballot in Kentucky or Virginia, elections in both states delivered Republican losses and Democratic gains following campaigns that featured a focus on the issue.

In a typical cycle, Virginia legislative elections wouldn’t garner significant coverage or voter turnout—no statewide offices were on the ballot, making it an “off-off” year—but all 140 seats in the commonwealth’s general assembly were up for grabs. GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin—whose gubernatorial victory in 2021 sparked early speculations about his future presidential prospects—barnstormed across the state campaigning for Republicans to take full control of the general assembly, drawing outsized attention and significance to the election. Democrats and Republicans funneled more than $150 million into the races—30 percent more than in 2019, the last cycle where the entire general assembly was up for election.

Suffice to say, Youngkin’s plan didn’t work, despite his previous electoral success in the state. Not only did Democrats retain control of the state Senate, they took back control of the House of Delegates. With a few races still too close to call, the tallies as of this morning show Democrats with a 21-17 majority in the Senate and a 51-47 majority in the House.

When elected in 2021, Youngkin helped Republicans flip the lower chamber red and sweep statewide offices in a state that President Joe Biden won in 2020 by just over 10 points. “We learned in 2021 how to win elections,” Youngkin, armed in his signature red vest, said at a closing rally in Leesburg on Monday night. “How do you win elections? Get more votes than the other guy.” To secure the governor’s mansion, Youngkin tapped into the anger and frustration of parents aggravated by COVID policies like school lockdowns and masking in 2021. He reprised that strategy this time around, holding a series of “Parents Matter” talks where he hammered home his message that “children belong to the parents and not the state.” Youngkin took a “Secure Your Vote” bus tour, stumping for candidates and encouraging Republicans to take advantage of early and absentee voting—making more than 100 stump appearances for candidates. He also raised nearly $30 million since his election and funneled much of it to state GOP candidates.

Heading into Tuesday, it was an open question whether parental rights and education would be as motivating a pitch for voters now farther removed from the pandemic. Plus, Democrats had a motivating issue of their own that Youngkin didn’t have to contend with (and actively avoided discussing) in 2021: the end of Roe v. Wade.

This time around, Youngkin made abortion a centerpiece of his messaging campaign, pushing a 15-week abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother—in hopes of planting a flag for Republicans and demonstrating that the party could win by coalescing around “reasonable limits” on abortion. “I think this is one where Virginians come together around reasonableness,” Youngkin said in an interview with ABC News’ George Stephanopoulos last week. “It then allows us to move onto really important topics,” he added, citing his ambitions to address issues like education and public safety with a unified, Republican general assembly.

Democrats also leaned into abortion, however, portraying Virginia Republicans as extremists who would take reproductive rights away from women in the state, where abortion is currently legal through 26 weeks of pregnancy. “Do you really trust anything Republicans say on this,” Susan Swecker, chair of the Virginia Democratic Party, said last month. Louise Lucas, a Democratic state senator, echoed that message last week: “From attacking our freedoms to trying to jail women and their doctors, MAGA Republican extremists are out of control.” And Lucas wasn’t alone—40 percent of Democratic candidates’ ads mentioned abortion, according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking firm.

The strategy seems to have worked. “We had hoped for a stronger outcome this evening but are proud of the effort all of our candidates put into these extremely competitive districts,” Dave Rexrode, a senior adviser to Youngkin, said late last night. Indeed, the defeat for Virginia Republicans—and by extension, Youngkin himself—will likely end any remaining “Youngkin 2024” chatter, which hinged on a strong blue-to-red flip.

Abortion was also on the ballot in Ohio. “Ohio Issue 1,” as the measure was called, would amend the state’s constitution to include a “right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” and “only allow the State to prohibit an abortion after an unborn child is determined by a pregnant woman’s treating physician to be viable and only if the physician does not consider the abortion necessary to protect the pregnant woman’s life or health.” The amendment passed 57 percent to 43 percent, making Ohio the first Republican-controlled state to enshrine abortion protections since the end of Roe. After the Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision, a six-week abortion ban signed into Ohio law in 2019 snapped into place—but was quickly put on hold due to a court challenge. The new amendment will take effect 30 days after yesterday’s election, and will then allow pro-choice legal groups to sue to repeal abortion restrictions as unconstitutional.

“Today, Ohioans made clear that abortion is a winning issue,” said Lauren Blauvelt, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, a coalition of pro-abortion-access organizations that supported the amendment. Pro-choice groups raised nearly triple what pro-life groups did in the homestretch of the campaign, and outspent their opponents in ad buys. Last night, activists took a victory lap. “Ohio is not a red state, we’re purple as hell, baby,” said Kellie Copeland, the executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio. President Joe Biden also went out of his way to praise the results. “Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy,” he said in a statement.

Pro-life groups fighting the amendment lamented the vote. “Our hearts are broken tonight not because we lost an election, but because Ohio families, women, and children will bear the brunt of this vote,” Protect Women Ohio, the leading group opposing Issue 1, said in a statement last night. And Republican lawmakers in the state said the battle is far from over. “This isn’t the end,” said Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman. “It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1.”

Tuesday’s results continued pro-choice groups’ victory from earlier this year when they led an effort to defeat a ballot initiative that sought to raise the required threshold for constitutional amendments from 50 percent to 60 percent of votes cast and increase signature requirements to get amendments on the ballot. The Republican-led initiative was a thinly veiled strategy to decrease the chances of an abortion amendment passing, making the measure a proxy battle over abortion rights. After an expensive campaign where millions of dollars in out-of-state funding flowed to both sides, voters rejected the measure in August, with 57 percent of votes cast against raising the threshold and only 43 percent in favor—the same breakdown as yesterday’s vote. (Ohio also passed another ballot initiative yesterday, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana. Across the country, there were more ballot measures than any off-year election since 2007.*)

In deeply red Kentucky, voters reelected the incumbent Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, rejecting the Republican challenger Daniel Cameron, Kentucky’s first black attorney general. Donald Trump won the state in 2020 by more than 25 points, but Democrats have had success in statewide races in previous cycles—including when Beshear ousted the incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019. Beshear’s reelection campaign leaned on his efforts leading the state through both the pandemic and the aftermath of devastating natural disasters. Beshear’s approval rating sits at about 60 percent—and 43 percent among Republican voters—making him one of the most popular governors in the country. As such, polling throughout the campaign suggested he’d hold onto his post, but his lead tightened towards the end of the race. Cameron—a close ally of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell—attempted to link Beshear to Biden, and Trump tried to drive that point home earlier this week. “If Beshear wins, you’ll have high crime, high taxes, and a Joe Biden stooge representing your state,” the former president said during a tele-rally on Monday.

Beshear argued his record stood for itself, and played up his image as a pragmatic problem solver. “This attorney general knows that if this race is about me versus him, that you know who I am and how I’ve led and how I’ve shown up every day,” Beshear said at a forum last month. Abortion played an outsized role in this election, as well: Beshear’s campaign aired a viral attack ad in September featuring a woman, Hadley Duvall, telling of how her stepfather raped her while she was a child. “This is to you, Daniel Cameron,” she said. “To tell a 12-year-old girl she must have the baby of her stepfather who raped her is unthinkable.” Cameron had endorsed Kentucky’s current abortion law, which bans abortions without exceptions for rape or incest. (Cameron suggested in September he’d sign a law to add rape and incest exceptions, but later reiterated his support for the existing ban.)

Beshear thanked Duvall in his victory speech last night. “Because of her courage, this commonwealth is going to be a better place and people are going to reach out for the help they need,” he said. Since Republicans control the legislature, there’s little the governor can do to change the state’s ban, but he has pushed for adding exceptions to the law.

Yesterday’s results will likely encourage Democrats to lean into the abortion issue even further next fall, and, at least for now, such a strategy doesn’t bode well for the GOP—particularly in light of Youngkin’s failure in Virginia. The governor’s campaign represented the most intentional and well-resourced attempt by Republicans since Dobbs to run on abortion, not away from it. Meanwhile, pro-choice advocates in Florida, Arizona, Missouri, South Dakota, and several other states are working to get abortion initiatives on the ballot in 2024—which leaves Republicans just 363 days to come up with a winning blueprint.

At this point, pro-life leaders are well aware of the electoral challenges they’re facing. “Gotta change tactics, gotta change messengers, gotta change strategy, gotta change something,” Patrick Brown, a pro-life advocate and fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said last night. “When abortion is on the ballot we’re getting creamed at the polls and it’s not even especially close.”

The message was later echoed by Fox News commentator Sean Hannity. “If we’re really going to be honest about this—and I consider myself pro-life, but I understand that’s not where the country is, I would say the first trimester, 15 weeks seems to be where the country is,” he said on Tuesday night. “And these issues will be decided by the states.”

Africa is poised to be home to one in four people on Earth by 2050—and could play a much larger role in global affairs as a result. In a comprehensive portrait of the youthful and growing continent, Declan Walsh, the New York Times chief Africa correspondent, explained what these demographic trends mean for Africa and the world—with the help of stunning photos by Hannah Reyes Morales. “Astonishing change is underway in Africa, where the population is projected to nearly double to 2.5 billion over the next quarter-century—an era that will not only transform many African countries, experts say, but also radically reshape their relationship with the rest of the world,” Walsh wrote. “Birthrates are tumbling in richer nations, creating anxiety about how to care for, and pay for, their aging societies. But Africa’s baby boom continues apace, fueling the youngest, fastest growing population on earth. The median age on the African continent is 19. In India, the world’s most populous country, it is 28. In China and the United States, it is 38. The implications of this ‘youthquake,’ as some call it, are immense yet uncertain, and likely to vary greatly across Africa, a continent of myriad cultures and some 54 countries that covers an area larger than China, Europe, India and the United States combined.”

Nov 08 2023,Ohio Abortion Vote Only Intensifies Conflict,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/frankpavone/ohio-roe/2023/11/08/id/1141511,"Ohio Issue 1 — A Sign of the Weakness, Not the Strength, of the Abortion Lobby

Ohio voters have made a big mistake. Issue 1 puts into their state's Constitution a ""right"" to unlimited abortion.

The first consideration is that nobody won last night on abortion. Abortion destroys everything it touches. It rips a living human baby to pieces.

It also brings profound devastation to the parents and family of that baby.

I have served for the last 20 years as the pastoral director of the world’s largest ministry for healing after abortion — Rachel’s Vineyard — and the largest mobilization of those who have had abortions and share their stories — the Silent No More Awareness Campaign.

In both roles I have seen human grief beyond description, as people wrestle with the shame of having had their own child killed.

It’s a lifetime of regret and multiple forms of damage to their own ability to function.

Abortion destroys the abortionists, who live under a convoluted and self-destructive pile of lies that dehumanize themselves as well as the babies they kill.

And abortion destroys our system of self-governance, because its proponents, to achieve their goals, have to steer people away from the legislative process.

Instead of considering the reality of what abortion is, they attempt to shut down all debate by inventing fake constitutional rights that have no basis in reason or in American history.

Indeed, it’s not a matter of anti-abortion wins or pro-abortion rights wins.

Unless anti-abortion wins, nobody wins.

The second consideration, building on this thought of shutting down debate, is that the abortion advocates and the Democrat candidates never describe what they defend.

You hear them talking about reproductive rights and health, and occasionally throwing the word “abortion” into the abortion debate, but they never describe what abortion is.

I challenge them to do so.

Don’t take my words or those of any pro-life leader. Use the words of the abortionists, from their medical textbooks.

Better yet, show the pictures of what abortion does to a baby. You’re celebrating a right to abortion, after all. So show us what it is.

In their statements on the passage of Issue 1 in Ohio last night, both President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris manifest complete oblivion as to why abortion is even a debate in this country, and that is, that along with the reproductive rights of women, Americans value the right to life of the child.

The fact that there even is a child, or a second life however they may want to designate it, does not even factor into their consideration or their language.

How can we have a debate on this issue when one side pretends that there is nothing to debate?

All of this leads me to conclude that the pursuit of these ballot initiatives for a “Constitutional right to abortion” rather than simply introducing a bill are not a sign of the strength of the abortion lobby, but of their weakness.

They know full well that the will of Ohio citizens has already been made known in the fact that Ohio has passed numerous reasonable limits on abortion and indeed has even passed the Heartbeat legislation.

Measures like Issue 1 are not meant to express the will of the people but to bypass it, and impose on the people and their elected representatives a fake right, an invented dogma, an un-American pretense, that somehow the people should be constitutionally prohibited from protecting the youngest children from what is undeniably an act of violence.

We have to ask, therefore, what happens next. What will their answer be when parents across Ohio begin finding out that their 15-year old daughter had an abortion — or a trans-gender surgery — and that they as parents no longer have a right to know about it?

How will voters respond when they see more abortion clinics opening in their neighborhood where healthy babies of healthy mothers are being aborted in the final months of pregnancy, and they are told that Ohioans can no longer use the legislative process to protect such children from having their heads chopped off?

Issue 1 creates the same kind of pressure-cooker in Ohio that Roe vs. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) created nationally.

By cutting off the ability of citizens to wrestle with abortion policy in ways they believe are reasonable, the other side has only intensified the conflict we have and will continue to have – in public policy and in our own hearts and minds — on this issue.

And it has narrowed the avenues by which that conflict can be resolved.

Nov 08 2023,Virginia Vote Shows the Failure of the Abortion ‘Compromise’,U.S. News & World Report,left,https://usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2023-11-08/virginia-vote-shows-the-failure-of-the-abortion-compromise,"Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin had a plan to save his Republican colleagues from the same fate suffered by anti-abortion GOP candidates since the Supreme Court took away the guaranteed right to an abortion: He proposed what he called a ""compromise"" on the politically volatile issue, a 15-week ban Youngkin said would isolate ""extremist"" Democrats and give Republicans full control in Virginia government.



It failed spectacularly, with Democrats keeping control of the state Senate and flipping the Virginia House of Delegates, according to projections by the Associated Press early Wednesday morning.

Despite a massive and pricey Republican early voting push spearheaded by Youngkin – and new state legislative district lines that made some districts far more challenging for some Democratic candidates – Democrats will have at least single-seat majorities in both chambers of the state legislature.

With votes still to be counted, Democrats had secured at least 21 seats in the 40-member state Senate and at least 51 seats in the 100-member House of Delegates, according to results posted as of Wednesday morning.

Republicans were leading narrowly in many of the outstanding races, but those races hinge on mail-in votes and provisional votes, which tend to heavily favor Democrats, according to Virginia political experts. Those votes will not be fully counted until next week.

The wins mean Virginia will remain the last Southern state where abortion is mostly legal. And it is a sign that Republicans are still struggling to control the electoral impact of a Supreme Court decision they fought for decades to achieve.

“The GOP lied at every turn. They called their plan to ban abortion in Virginia a plan to keep abortion legal in the state and claimed it was just a 'limit.' Well, tonight, Virginians showed the GOP and Glenn Youngkin exactly what voters have to say about it: We don’t want abortion bans, and we don’t want leaders who do,"" Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement after Democrats had secured control of both chambers of Virginia state government.

The stunning Virginia results ""serve as a warning sign for the GOP heading into 2024,"" Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement. ""While GOP candidates rallied around protecting babies from painful late-term abortions beginning at 15 weeks, they allowed Democrats to dominate the abortion narrative on the airwaves and sow confusion with voters. Last night proved this is not a formula for success for the GOP,"" she added.

More than a year after the high court reversed Roe v. Wade, abortion remained a driving force in Tuesday night's elections – especially notable in an off-year election with no regular federal offices on the ballot to drive turnout.



Ohio voters overwhelmingly approved a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing reproductive rights, including the right to an abortion until ""viability,"" generally defined at 22-24 weeks. A patient could get an abortion after that if the life or health of the pregnant woman or girl is imperiled.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Judge Daniel McCaffery won a seat on the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court in a race where abortion rights was a central issue. His election means Democrats will have a 5-2 majority on the state's highest court.

In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won reelection easily in the deep red state after a campaign that cast his opponent, Republican Daniel Cameron, as an extreme anti-abortion candidate. Only later in the campaign did Cameron amend his position to approve of abortion in cases of rape or incest – and it was not enough to sway voters.

""My biggest takeaway from tonight: in '22 abortion rights had the biggest impact where it was literally on the ballot, less so when trying to draw the connection in candidate races,"" Tom Bonier, senior adviser for the elections data company TargetSmart, said on social media after the election results.

""That has changed. Voters clearly made the connection that voting for GOP candidates = abortion bans.""

Youngkin, who is widely believed to have presidential ambitions, sought to thread the needle on the polarizing issue of abortion. While he had long described himself as ""pro-life,"" he later settled on a ban on abortion after 15 weeks (with exceptions thereafter), casting it as a template for Republican candidates across the nation.



""I think this is one where Virginians come together around reasonableness. And it then allows us to move onto really important topics,"" Youngkin said on ABC's ""This Week"" days before the election.

That didn't work on Virginia voters and calls into question whether such ""compromises"" will help Republicans going into the critical 2024 elections. It also takes the steam out of the political march of Youngkin, who has been considered a potential presidential contender since winning the governorship in swing-state Virginia in 2021."

Nov 07 2023,All Eyes on Ohio with Abortion Amendment on the Ballot,NTD,right,https://ntd.com/all-eyes-on-ohio-with-abortion-amendment-on-the-ballot_952806.html,"A months-long push to cement abortion as a right in Ohio’s constitution prevailed on Nov. 7 as voters turned out to weigh in on the controversial ballot measure.

Issue 1 was the only abortion-related question on the ballot nationwide this Election Day, drawing the eyes—and funds—of abortion and pro-life activists around the country.

At the time the Associated Press called the race, the yes vote on the measure was leading 57-42 percent. Many expect the results to foreshadow the outcomes of similar ballot initiatives planned for other states next year.

Early turnout in the election exceeded that of the state’s special election in August, with more than 860,000 people casting their ballots prior to Election Day.

That was also likely due in part to Issue 2, a citizen-led initiative to legalize marijuana purchases, sales, and, for adults aged 21 and older, possession.

At the time of reporting, the yes vote on that measure was leading 55-44 percent.

Debate

The newly-passed constitutional amendment establishes that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.”

Opponents of the measure objected to its broad language, noting that it applied to “every individual,” not just women or adults.

And although the amendment included a provision stating that abortion “may be prohibited after fetal viability,” it barred such a restriction in cases where the mother’s treating physician decides that the procedure is “necessary to protect the patient’s life or health.”

The treating physician, detractors noted, would be the same doctor paid to perform the abortion.

Other concerns voters raised included the possibility that the new law could be interpreted to include a right for children to undergo sex-altering procedures and that it would nullify an existing state law requiring parental consent for abortions performed on minors.

“Issue 1 on the ballot goes far beyond reasonableness,” northeastern Ohio resident and independent voter Joanne Arnett told The Epoch Times before voting against the measure.

“I cringe to imagine putting doctors and nurses in the situation to kill a fully formed child right before birth,” she said. “I cringe to imagine a 30-year who was convinced as a child by teachers and psychologists to undergo removal and mutilation of their sex organs and put them on hormone blockers and then have the realization years later of the damage that was done to them.”

But Mathis Kleckley, a Christian bus driver from Reynoldsburg, said he voted yes on Issue 1 because he believes that God gives people choices, and that others should not have the ability to “play God” and take them away.

“We don’t want the government playing God either,” he said.

Other proponents have pushed back on claims that Issue 1 would legalize abortion through birth or erase parents’ rights.

The measure, they held, would simply solidify protections for rights that have been challenged nationally since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year in its Dobbs v. Jackson ruling.

In Ohio, abortion is currently legal through 22 weeks gestation. A 2019 limit on abortions after a fetal heartbeat has been detected—usually at around six weeks—that has been on hold due to litigation will likely be rendered moot by Issue 1’s passage.

“Fundamental freedoms are fundamental freedoms, right?” Abhi Rahman, national communications director for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said on a Nov. 6 call with reporters.

“At the end of the day, people know what they’re voting for. People know the main part of it is to make sure that people in Ohio have access to reproductive health care,” he added. “And, you know, regardless of how broad it is, that’s the important part, really—putting things the way they were before Roe fell and before the Dobbs decision.”

Implications

Several other states have weighed in on abortion since the court’s June 2022 ruling with similar results.

Last year, voters in Kansas voted down a ballot referendum that aimed to establish that the state’s constitution did not guarantee a right to abortion. A similar measure in Kentucky met the same fate, while a referendum to increase protections for babies who survive abortion attempts was rejected in Montana.

As Ohio’s election results were announced, reactions from interested parties poured in from around the country.

For Melissa Ohden, founder and CEO of the Missouri-based Abortion Survivors Network, the outcome was disappointing, but not wholly discouraging.

“The Dobbs decision returned the question of abortion to the states, and the people of Ohio have cast their vote to amend their constitution,” she told The Epoch Times. “Despite this, I believe that the people of Ohio will take this opportunity to ensure every woman knows that abortion is not the only choice she has and will strive to provide solutions to the challenges women face when contemplating terminating their pregnancy.”

Meanwhile, for the pro-abortion Indivisible Project, the results were a reason for celebration.

“Tonight, we are elated by this pro-choice victory in Ohio and in awe of the voters and dedicated leaders on the ground who sent a clear message ahead of 2024: abortion access is non-negotiable,” Indivisible Project Managing Director Mari Urbina said in a statement.

“Despite the odds and the obstacles voters faced, this election demonstrates the enduring belief in reproductive freedom, and that will always be stronger than the well-funded attempts to subvert it,” she continued, adding that her organization was “taking notes” from how the Ohio results might foretell future initiatives in other states.

Next year, voters in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, and potentially South Dakota will be asked to sound off on their own abortion referendums.

But only time will tell if, as many expect, the outcome in Ohio will serve as a bellwether for those other initiatives.

Dec 09 2023,Texas Supreme Court Halts Pro-Abortion Order by Lower Court,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/texas-supreme-court-halts-pro-abortion-order-by-lower-court-5544174,"The Texas Supreme Court has halted a district court’s order that granted a pregnant woman the right to an abortion despite the state’s strict abortion ban.

The Texas Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a pregnant woman from getting an emergency abortion, a lower court decision in a lawsuit by a pregnant woman seeking a court-authorized abortion, with the move blocking her ability to terminate the pregnancy.

The Texas Supreme Court on Friday temporarily halted a lower court’s decision that granted a pregnant woman the ability to get an emergency court-authorized abortion despite the state’s strict rules against getting one.

The high court’s Dec. 9 decision came after a district court a day earlier granted a request for an emergency abortion in a lawsuit brought by Kate Cox, a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant and whose unborn baby was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a condition that causes multiple structural abnormalities that doctors said gave it no chance of survival after birth.

By an order issued on Dec. 8, the Texas Supreme Court applied an administrative stay—without ruling on the merits of the case—to the temporary restraining order issued by a judge at the District Court of Travis County, Texas, which paused Texas’ strict abortion laws so that Ms. Cox could legally terminate her pregnancy.

In its decision, the high court said that it would consider the matter further and issue a more comprehensive ruling at a later time.

The Texas Supreme Court ruling came in response to a motion filed late Friday by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who sent a letter to three Texas hospitals, warning them that they faced the prospect of legal action if they allowed the abortion to take place at their facility.

“The TRO [temporary restraining order] will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires,” Mr. Paxton said in a statement , while the letter states that the restraining order will not insulate the hospitals from civil and criminal liability.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, the pro-abortion rights group that brought the lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Cox, denounced the decision and accused Mr. Paxton of “playing despicable political games.”

More Details Ms. Cox was seeking the right to abort her baby after doctors diagnosed it with Trisomy 18 and gave it no chance of survival after birth. “This fight is not over,” the group said in a post on X . “No one should have to beg a court for permission to receive the medical care their doctors recommend.”Ms. Cox was seeking the right to abort her baby after doctors diagnosed it with Trisomy 18 and gave it no chance of survival after birth.

Several doctors also told Ms. Cox that continuing to carry the pregnancy to term could threaten her health and future fertility.

The Center for Reproductive Rights then filed a lawsuit on Ms. Cox’s behalf on Dec. 5, asking the judge to impose a temporary restraining order—and a permanent injunction—against Texas’ strict abortion laws.

Texas’ abortion laws prohibit and criminalize abortions in all cases except when the mother’s life is in danger under a “medical emergency” exception.

In her complaint, Ms. Cox’s attorneys argued that because she had two prior cesarean sections (C-sections), continuing the pregnancy put her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including hysterectomy and uterine rupture.

Also, they said that Texas’ abortion laws mean that doctors’ “hands are tied,” and Ms. Cox “will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death.”

They argued that an abortion was the safest option for Ms. Cox’s health and her “best medical option given that she wants to have more children in the future.”

Lawyers for the State of Texas argued in court that Ms. Cox’s symptoms did not meet the standard set out for a “medical emergency” and that her doctors made a “subjective” determination that she qualified for an abortion rather than basing their medical opinion on “objective” standards set out in law.

During an emergency hearing on Thursday, Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, a Democrat, agreed with Ms. Cox’s attorneys and granted the temporary restraining order that would have allowed her to get the abortion in Texas.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,“ Judge Gamble said from the bench. ”So I will be signing the order, and it will be processed and sent out today.”"
Dec 09 2023,Lawmakers propose allowing homicide charges for women who have abortions,Jefferson City News Tribune,center,https://newstribune.com/news/2023/dec/09/lawmakers-propose-allowing-homicide-charges-for,"Some Missouri lawmakers are renewing a call for the state to take an anti-abortion step that goes further than prominent anti-abortion groups want to go and that has not gained much traction in any state so far: a law that would allow homicide charges against women who obtain abortions.

Republicans in both the state House and Senate have introduced bills to be considered in the legislative session that begins next month to apply homicide laws on behalf of a victim who is an ""unborn child at every stage of development.""

The bills would offer exceptions if the suspect is a woman who aborts a pregnancy after being coerced or threatened, or an abortion is provided by a physician to save the life of the pregnant woman.

""To me, it's just about protecting a baby's life like we do every other person's life,"" state Rep. Bob Titus, a first-term Republican who is sponsoring one of the measures, told the Associated Press. ""The prosecution is just a consequence of taking an innocent human life.""

Titus said no charges would need to be brought under the bill, so long as people abide by the law already on the books that makes Missouri one of 14 states with bans in effect on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions.

Titus said he has not discussed his bill with legislative leaders and did not base it on any model legislation, though it is aligned with a bill by Republican state Sen. Mike Moon, who represents the same area in southwestern Missouri.

Two groups are trying to get measures on ballots in Missouri in 2024 to legalize abortion in more cases. One would bar the government from infringing on abortion rights during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. The other, being crafted by moderate Republicans, would scale back restrictions to a lesser degree.

Abortion-related measures could be before voters in several states next year. Since last year, voters have sided with abortion rights in all seven states where the questions have been on the ballot.

The abortion landscape in the U.S. has been shifting quickly since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and ended a nationwide right to abortion.

Most Republican-controlled states have adopted bans or restrictions and most Democrat-run states have taken steps to protect access.

Prominent anti-abortion groups have generally opposed measures that would subject women who get abortions to charges.

Still, identical legislation was introduced earlier this year in Missouri and similar bills were introduced in 2023 in other states including Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky and South Carolina. None was advanced by a legislative committee.

The Kentucky measure died after it was opposed by the state's Republican attorney general and legislative leaders. At the time, GOP House Speaker David Osborne said the Republican majority in his chamber had never contemplated passing an abortion ban without any exceptions.

In South Carolina, more than 20 GOP lawmakers signed on as sponsors of a bill that would have classified abortion as homicide. As the bill garnered attention, several lawmakers withdrew their support. Lawmakers later adopted a ban on abortions when cardiac activity can be detected, generally around six weeks into a pregnancy -- and often before women realize they are pregnant."

Attorney General Ken Paxton petitioned the state’s highest court to stay the lower court’s ruling in one of the first lawsuits brought by a pregnant person seeking an abortion since the state banned the procedure in nearly all cases after the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.

The Supreme Court said it will weigh in on the case when the justices have more time to consider it, according to the court filing.

“While we still hope that the court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case, we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” said Molly Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. The center is currently leading two abortion-related lawsuits in the state.

Kate Cox, 31, sued the state earlier this week for access to an abortion after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis that doctors say could risk her health or future fertility. Travis County District Court Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted a temporary restraining order allowing the abortion under the medical exemption clauses of the Texas’ abortion bans.

Under the temporary restraining order, obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Damla Karsan would have been allowed to perform Cox’s abortion.

Paxton’s petition — filed Thursday, according to state Supreme Court records — asked Texas’ highest court to undo that temporary restraining order, potentially rendering Cox’s medical team criminally or civilly liable under state abortion laws. Paxton separately sent a letter to three Houston hospitals where Karsan reportedly holds privileges threatening legal action should Cox obtain the abortion.

“Your hospital may be liable for negligently credentialing the physician and failing to exercise appropriate professional judgment, among other potential regulatory and civil violations, if you permit Dr. Karsan to perform an unlawful abortion,” Paxton said in the letter.

Paxton requested a response to his filings no later than Friday, arguing that, given the nature of the suit, “time is of the essence.” Cox’s lawyers responded Friday, calling the Paxton’s petition “stunning in its disregard for Ms. Cox’s life, fertility, and the rule of law.”

Legal experts say it could serve as a case model for similar situations in the other 20 states where abortion is outlawed or restricted. A pregnant Kentucky woman filed a lawsuit Friday arguing that her state’s near-total abortion ban violates her rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

Before filing the suit with the state, Cox experienced severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks that sent her to the emergency room multiple times. Doctors diagnosed her baby with full trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, which makes it highly unlikely the baby will survive long after birth if it’s not stillborn.

The lawsuit alleges that Cox is at risk for severe complications that could threaten her life or fertility given her two prior cesarean sections and elevated vital signs.

“An abortion was not something I ever imagined I would want or need; I just never thought I’d be in the situation I’m in right now. Twenty weeks pregnant with a baby that won’t survive and could jeopardize my health and a future pregnancy,” Cox wrote in a firsthand account published on Dallasnews.com. “I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas.”

Under the state’s abortion bans, pregnant people can only obtain an abortion if they have a “life-threatening physical condition” or are at risk of “substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” It’s a definition at the heart of another case, Zurawski v. State of Texas, that includes 20 women who say their abortions were delayed or denied because the exemptions were unclear.

During Thursday’s hearing, the state’s attorney Jonathan Stone took issue with the assertion that Cox qualifies for an abortion under current state laws.

The state consulted Dr. Ingrid Skop to review the case. Stone said Skop, a San Antonio obstetrician-gynecologist who also served as an expert witness for the state in the Zurawski case, didn’t think the pleadings sufficiently met the medical exemption criteria.

Duane said it’s unclear what the state considers to be qualifications needed for a medical exemption.

“I read the statute, Dr. Karsan reads the statute to say that a serious risk of substantial impairment of Ms. Cox’s reproductive functions would fall within the medical exemption,” Duane said. “If that is not what the statute means, then the state after two years of silence really ought to tell us.”

Duane and the state recently argued in front of the Texas Supreme Court over the Zurawski lawsuit, which requests a temporary injunction that would protect any Texan with a medically complicated pregnancy from the state’s bans. It could be months before the court issues its decision on the case."

The woman, Kate Cox, 31 is in her second trimester of pregnancy. She has two children. Her unborn child was diagnosed with Trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days after birth.

According to multiple reports, Cox asked a court in Austin to temporarily block the state’s ban on abortion so she can go through with the procedure. The court granted her request.

“The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, a Democrat, said, according to CNN. “So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, threatened legal action if the abortion takes place, The Washington Post reported. In a letter to hospitals involved with Cox’s care, he wrote that her physician did not meet “all of the elements necessary to fall within an exception to Texas’ abortion laws” and that the judge was “not medically qualified to make this determination.”

Additionally, Paxton said that the judge’s ruling would not excuse a hospital or a physician from civil or criminal liability “including first degree felony prosecutions.”

In an interview on Thursday, Cox claimed that “even with being hopeful with the decision that came from the hearing this morning, there’s still…we’re going through the loss of a child. There’s no outcome here that I take home my healthy baby girl,” she claimed.

“It’s hard, just, you know, grief,” she said, adding that “joy and grief can coexist” when it comes to her decision to end her unborn child’s life.

“There’s moments of joy. I’m really grateful for my wonderful two children that I have and my wonderful family and it’s a moment of sadness but we really have a wonderful life here in our home state and so, you know, I just try to count my blessings,” she said.

Kate Cox, the mother of two whose request for an abortion was granted by a Texas judge, speaks out to @NBCNews in an emotional interview after the ruling.

Nov 29 2023,Arkansas Attorney General Rejects Abortion Ballot Measure Wording,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/29/arkansas-attorney-general-rejects-abortion-ballot-measure-wording,"The Arkansas Attorney General rejected on Tuesday the wording of an effort to place abortion on the ballot in 2024.

Republican state Attorney General Tim Griffin rejected the popular name and ballot title application “due to ambiguities” and called the proposal “tinged with partisan coloring and misleading.”

Arkansans for Limited Government submitted the proposal, called “The Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment” on Nov. 9. The measure, as written, would have barred the government from “restrict[ing] access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception, or in cases of rape, incest, in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant female’s life or health.”

The rest of the rejected language reads:

Except for the circumstances enumerated in Section 1, the Arkansas General Assembly may prohibit or restrict access to abortion only when it establishes a compelling government interest achieved by the least restrictive means. The government of the State of Arkansas, its officers, or its political subdivisions shall not penalize an individual for requesting or receiving abortion services nor shall it penalize a person or entity that assists an individual in relation to abortion services. A government interest is “compelling” only if it is for the purpose of protecting the health of an individual seeking access, does not infringe on the individual’s decision making, and is consistent with widely accepted clinical standards of practice and evidence-based medicine. A fatal fetal anomaly means a fetal condition diagnosed before birth that, in the physician’s good faith medical judgment, is incompatible with life outside the womb and for which medical intervention would be futile.

Griffin listed several aspects of the proposal that disqualified the language from moving on to the signature collection stage, including internal contradictions, redundancy, and the use of the term “access” and the broad term “health.”

“Is your intent to limit government action regarding abortion itself or regarding access to abortion? Under the Arkansas Supreme Court’s caselaw, the ballot title would need to describe the nature of the restriction you intend to propose. Because of this lack of clarity, I am unable to say that your ballot title is not misleading,” he wrote.

“Second, the last clause refers to ‘the pregnant female’s life or health’ but does not define what is meant by ‘health.’ Is the term intended to cover physical health only, or also mental health? If the term is limited to physical health, is that intended to be restricted to emergent medical conditions? Or does it the term [sic] also extend to pregnancies that increase the risk of certain medical complications?” he continued.

“Answers to these questions would almost certainly give voters ‘serious ground for reflection.’ Therefore the ballot title would need to inform the potential petitioner or voter about these matters,” he added.

Griffin also said the proposed popular name is “tinged with partisan coloring and misleading” because the proposal is “solely related to abortion, not ‘reproductive healthcare’ generally.”



Lastly, the attorney general pointed out that the proposal does not describe how the amendment would impact existing constitutional law.

“For example, you make no effort to articulate how your proposal would relate to Amendment 68 to our state constitution,” he said, referencing an amendment enacted in 1988, which states that Arkansas policy is “to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.”

“It seems plausible that even if your proposal were enacted in its current form, portions of Amendment 68 would remain,” he continued. “Since the Arkansas Supreme Court has declared that voters are entitled to some information on how the proposed measure would change current law, some such information would need to be provided.”

Griffin further noted that the proposal’s goal to keep abortion legal within “18 weeks of conception” is inconsistent with the broadly used metric of counting weeks from a woman’s last menstrual cycle.

“This time frame is keyed to fetal age, which begins at conception. But most court cases, medical providers, and most citizens count the weeks of pregnancy using gestational age, which begins from the date of the woman’s last menstrual cycle, not from the date of conception,” he said.

“When counting from the more standard starting point, the reference to ’18 weeks’ is closer to ’20 weeks.’ This difference in timing could be misleading to voters and would certainly give them serious ground for reflection,” he said. “This is not a basis to reject your proposal as misleading. But if your proposal were at the stage where it could be certified, I would have to substitute language in your ballot title to flag for all voters that the timeframe for government regulation would begin at 20 weeks gestational age.”

The ballot committee told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that it “appreciate[s] the Attorney General’s thorough review of and impartial response to the amendment’s language.”

“Residents want sensible reproductive policy, and Arkansans for Limited Government will begin work immediately with the amendment drafter to craft a revised amendment,” the group said. “We are committed to supporting a ballot proposal that is clear for Arkansas voters.”

Abortion is currently completely outlawed in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother.

According to the Secretary of State’s office, the group would need 90,704 signatures to put the measure on the November 2024 ballot. If a measure with revised language makes it onto the ballot in 2024, it would require a simple majority to pass.

Activists in at least nine other states are working to put abortion amendments on the ballot next year, after a string of state-level pro-abortion victories following the fall of Roe v. Wade — a 1973 Supreme Court decision which had, for 50 years, invented a “right” to abortion.

Dec 08 2023,Supreme Court justices to discuss whether to hear abortion pill showdown,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-justices-discuss-whether-hear-abortion-pill-showdown-rcna128579,"WASHINGTON — Supreme Court justices were scheduled on Friday to discuss whether to take up a high-stakes legal fight that could result in a definitive decision on federal approval of the drug most commonly used for medication abortion.

At their regular private meeting, the nine justices were due to consider three different appeals raising different legal issues, including one filed by those challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s original 2000 approval of the mifepristone pill.

The two other appeals, brought by the Biden administration and drugmaker Danco Laboratories, are seeking to uphold decisions by the FDA that made it easier to access and use the pill in recent years. Danco makes the brand version of the pill, Mifeprex.

Even the court's decision on whether to take up the appeals is of practical importance because if the justices decide not to intervene in the ongoing litigation, an appeals court ruling that limited the availability of the drug by mail would go into effect.

The court later on Friday announced it was hearing one new case but the abortion cases were not mentioned. The court could next act on Monday or later next week.

In weighing the three appeals, the justices could choose to hear a broad challenge that addresses the 2000 FDA approval or focus only on more recent changes, including a 2021 decision that made it possible to access the pill by mail.

The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has previously shown hostility to abortion rights, overturning the landmark abortion rights ruling Roe v. Wade last year. But in April, in an earlier stage of the litigation, the court blocked a judge’s ruling that would have completely invalided the FDA’s approval of the drug.

The abortion pill dispute does not directly address any right to abortion, focusing instead on different legal issues about the FDA’s process for approving drugs, but the case raises questions over the court’s pledge last year that it would leave abortion policy to the states and the federal government.

Other issues raised in the cases include the 2016 decisions to extend the window in which mifepristone could be used to terminate pregnancies from seven weeks’ gestation to 10 weeks’ gestation, and reduce the number of in-person visits patients from three to one. In another 2016 move, the FDA altered the dosing regimen, finding that a lower dose of mifepristone was sufficient.

The court could also address the 2019 decision to approve a generic form of the drug, which is made by GenBioPro.

The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August ruled that the post-2016 FDA decisions should be put on hold because the moves “were taken without sufficient consideration of the effects those changes would have on patients.” The court ruled against the challengers on their efforts to overturn the original approval of the drug and the later decision to authorize the generic version.

Both sides then filed appeals at the Supreme Court.

The current fight over the drug dates back to a November 2022 lawsuit filed by a group of doctors and other medical professionals represented by the conservative Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom. They claim that the FDA’s 2000 approval was flawed, as were later decisions that made the drug easier to access, in part because they failed to take into account safety risks to women.

In a sweeping decision, Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk in April invalidated the FDA’s original approval of the drug from more than 20 years ago. After the Supreme Court put that decision on hold while litigation continued, the appeals court narrowed the scope of Kacsmaryk’s ruling, focusing on the post-2016 changes.

The FDA-approved regimen for a medication abortion involves two drugs: mifepristone, which blocks the hormone progesterone, and misoprostol, which induces contractions. A majority of abortions in the U.S. are carried out using the pills, according to a survey conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights.

Access to medication abortion, especially by mail, has become of major importance in light of the Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, which has led to conservative states enacting tough restrictions that either limit or ban abortion outright. Fourteen states currently have total abortion bans, according to Guttmacher."

Nov 28 2023,"Texas AGs Office: Sue Docs, Not State, on Abortion Access",Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/texas-attorney-general-abortion/2023/11/28/id/1143961,"The Texas Attorney General's Office argued this week that women in the state should sue their doctors instead of the state over a lack of access to abortion procedures, The Hill reports.

The Texas Supreme Court is hearing a case involving the state's law banning abortions after a heartbeat is detected with exceptions only if the mother's life is in danger. The Texas Attorney General's Office is defending against a lawsuit brought by the Center for Reproductive Freedom on behalf of 22 women who claim that the law had forced them to remain pregnant with a nonviable fetus, which put them at serious risk.

The law imposed strict penalties, including the potential of life in prison, for performing an abortion on a fetus after a heartbeat was detected. This includes complicated pregnancies in which the fetus would not survive birth, which prompted a district judge last August to prevent the prosecution of doctors who performed abortions in cases such as these, a ruling that the Texas Attorney General's Office appealed to the state Supreme Court.

The state argued in court on Tuesday that the language in the bill states that abortion is allowed if there is ""a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy"" and therefore the lawsuit is unnecessary. The state also claims that these women should sue their doctors instead.

During oral arguments, Texas Attorney General's Office lawyer Beth Klusmann responded to plaintiff's claims that the law created a ""health care crisis"" in the state by saying, ""If a woman is bleeding, if she has amniotic fluid running down her legs — then the problem is not with the law. It is with the doctors.""

Molly Duane, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued that ""The last two years"" since the law passed ""are an aberration from a centuries-long practice in Texas that allowed physicians broad discretion over when abortion was necessary to preserve their patient's lives.""

She continued, ""The abortion bans, as they exist today, subject physicians like my clients to the most penalties imaginable."""
Nov 17 2023,Iowa Board of Medicine proposes abortion rules for physicians,KOLN,center,https://1011now.com/2023/11/18/iowa-board-medicine-proposes-abortion-rules-physicians,"DES MOINES, Iowa (Gray Iowa Capitol Bureau) - Critics say Iowa’s Board of Medicine is not providing clarity for doctors on how to follow the state’s new abortion ban. House File 732 bans any abortion once cardiac activity is detected - typically around six weeks. That law is on hold right now as it is on appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court.

The main questions around Iowa’s new abortion ban is the exceptions. Those are for rape, incest or fetal abnormalities that would be incompatible with life. The Board of Medicine’s rules are meant to help doctors navigate that but critics who spoke at a hearing today say they don’t do that.

Deborah Turner, a former gynecologist said “First and foremost, you are physicians and your duty is to do no harm. That means no harm to those who you are serving which is in reality your patients. That duty does not fall away because you are sitting on a rule making board.”

Turner told the board the rules do little to support doctors mission. She pointed to some of the language used in the rules mirroring that of anti-abortion groups and lawmakers. “Terminology such as Heartbeat Law as opposed to six week ban, and unborn child as opposed to fetus or embryo instead of words like pregnancy are words used to evoke emotion, not to describe medical situations,” Turner said.

Ultimately, the rules put the judgment on the doctor on whether an abortion qualifies for an exemption. For rape and incest, for example, the proposed rules ask the doctor to gather details about when sex happened and whether it was consensual, then make a judgement call on if the woman is being truthful.

Francesca Turner, an OB/GYN in Des Moines finds that disturbing. “Physicians in Iowa seek to care for their patients, not document minutiae of assault or jeopardize physician-patient relationships by demanding horrifying details,” Turner said.

Ultimately critics worry the law and vague rules for following it could scare doctors out of Iowa. “Physicians in Iowa seek to promote magnificence and justice, not to withhold care while waiting for our patients to fully miscarry or their health to decline enough to qualify for treatment,” Turner said.

The rules also don’t offer specific punishments if a doctor violates the law - just saying it could result in discipline. A representative from the Attorney General’s office says that would follow usual protocol for doctors violating the law - which can range from a fine to losing their licenses.

Due to an injunction, the abortion law isn’t in effect currently. Regardless, the Board of Medicine has to come up with these rules anyways.

Dec 07 2023,Texas judge grants mother's request for abortion for fetus's fatal condition,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/texas-judge-grants-mothers-request-for-abortion-for-fetuss-fatal-condition,"

A Texas district court judge on Thursday granted a request to allow a physician to perform an abortion in the case of a pregnant woman whose fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition, contradicting the state’s strict ban on abortion.

Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County District Court granted Kate Cox a temporary restraining order to permit her physician to perform an abortion without facing civil or criminal penalties.

BIDEN ASSERTS AUTHORITY TO CLAIM PATENTS OF DRUGS DEVELOPED WITH FEDERAL RESEARCH

Cox, 31, is the mother of two young children. In an interview on Tuesday, Cox told reporters that she and her husband never planned on having an abortion and had hoped to grow their family.

Cox’s fetus, at 20 weeks gestation, has been diagnosed with trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition that slows growth before birth and often results in miscarriage. Due to several life-threatening complications, only 5%-10% of children born with trisomy 18 live past their first year of life, with those surviving having severe intellectual disabilities.

Gamble, a Democrat, agreed with Cox’s lawyers’ argument abortion was necessary to protect her from a potentially dangerous birth process and the preservation of her fertility.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be pregnant, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability, is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” the judge said at the conclusion of the hearing on Thursday.

The Texas attorney general’s office may seek intervention in a higher court, arguing that Cox did not qualify for a medical exemption to the state’s abortion ban, which prohibits the procedure except to save the health and life of the mother.

Cox is being represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights advocacy organization.

“Today’s decision underscores what we already know — abortion is essential health care. While we are grateful that Kate will be able to get this urgent medical care, it is unforgivable that she was forced to go to court to ask for it in the middle of a medical emergency,” said Molly Duane, senior staff attorney for CRR, in a press statement on Thursday.

The Lone Star State is the epicenter of the battle over abortion rights, prohibiting abortion from the moment of fertilization and allowing citizens to sue others in civil court who aid women in obtaining the procedure.

“Most women are not able to do what Kate has done — many Texans have been forced to continue pregnancies that put their lives at risk. That is happening every day across Texas. As long as abortion is banned, pregnant people will suffer,” added Duane."

Ahead of a Fox News debate between California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an ad from a political action committee tied to Newsom claims that a law signed by DeSantis would subject women who get an abortion after six weeks to felony charges.

DeSantis’ campaign calls the claim “a lie,” citing DeSantis’ insistence in media interviews that the law does not criminalize women who get abortions, only physicians who perform them.

Nonetheless, Democrats cite ambiguity in the language of the new law, which would make it a felony for “[a]ny person who willfully performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy” after six weeks of pregnancy. They say the inclusion of anyone who “actively participates” might subject women getting an abortion to criminal charges. DeSantis insists that only refers to “medical practitioners” and that he does not support penalties for women who get an abortion outside the state’s legal window.

Newsom, a Democrat, and DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, will square off in a 90-minute debate on Fox News on Nov. 30 in what the network is advertising as “The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate.”

Newsom on the Attack

On Nov. 19, Campaign for Democracy, a political action committee launched by Newsom, began airing a TV ad attacking DeSantis for signing into law a six-week abortion ban in Florida in April.

The ad begins with the image of a “wanted”-style poster as the narrator says, “Wanted, by order of Governor Ron DeSantis, any woman who has an abortion after six weeks and any doctor who gives her care will be guilty of a felony. Abortion after six weeks will be punishable by up to five years in prison. Even though many women don’t even know they’re pregnant at six weeks. That’s not freedom. It’s Ron DeSantis’ Florida.”

Newsom posted the ad on X, formerly known as Twitter, and commented, “Any woman who has an abortion after six weeks — and any doctor who gives her care — will be guilty of a felony. Abortion after six weeks will be punishable by up to 5 years in prison.”

The rapid response team for the DeSantis campaign called the ad “[s]heer desperation” and warned, “if this ad is any indication, Newsom will spend the debate lying about @RonDeSantis‘ record to deflect from his own failures.”

And DeSantis campaign spokesman Bryan Griffin also responded on X: “Democrats like @GavinNewsom can’t defend their own position on abortion (up until birth) so they make stuff up to scare people. If Newsom tries this nonsense at the debate, @RonDeSantis will set him straight the way he’s already set the media straight on this lie.”

Griffin linked to a video of DeSantis in an interview on CBS News denying that the law he signed would criminalize women.

Florida’s Abortion Law

In April 2022, DeSantis signed a bill that banned most abortions after 15 weeks, replacing a previous law that allowed abortions up to 24 weeks. The state Supreme Court is considering a challenge that claims the law violates the state constitution.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, returning the jurisdiction on abortion rights to the states, the Republican-led Florida Legislature addressed the abortion issue earlier this year, and passed a six-week ban. The bill includes an exception for mothers whose lives are at risk, and delays the abortion ban to 15 weeks for pregnancy caused by rape, incest or human trafficking. DeSantis signed the bill into law in April, though it does not go into effect unless or until the state Supreme Court upholds the constitutionality of the 2022 law.

Under the penalty portion, the law states, “Any person who willfully performs, or actively participates in, a termination of pregnancy in violation of the requirements” of the law “commits a felony of the third degree.” (Third-degree felonies carry a sentence of up to five years in prison.) That ramps up to a felony of the second degree in abortions that result in the death of the woman.

Clarifying Language Proposed

There were more than 50 unsuccessful amendments proposed to the bill, but none sought directly to change the “actively participates in” language.

But on Sept. 15, Florida Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book filed a bill to make clear that women getting an abortion cannot be criminally charged under the new abortion law. The proposed bill cites comments DeSantis made in an interview with Norah O’Donnell on “CBS Evening News” assuring that the penalties in the abortion law do not pertain to women getting an abortion.

DeSantis, Sept. 13: We have no criminal penalties, the penalties are for the physician. O’Donnell: Governor, I read the bill, it says just this, it does include jail time and fines for “any person who willfully performs, or actively participates in a termination of pregnancy.” DeSantis: Right, and that’s for the providers. That is not for the women. We’ve litigated this. O’Donnell: Is a woman not actively participating in the termination of her pregnancy? DeSantis: No, because she’s not a medical practitioner. O’Donnell: So you are not for criminalizing women? DeSantis: No. No. Absolutely not. And that will not happen in Florida. … A lot of these women, they don’t get any support. You know, they have a father who abandons them. They don’t have the resources. Now in Florida, we’ve done a lot to try to help on that. But a lot of these folks are very vulnerable. A lot of them don’t want to do an abortion, but they feel like they have no other option. And so that’s part of the reason why I’ve never supported penalties against women.

DeSantis has made similar assurances in other public forums. In an interview in August, Dasha Burns of NBC News read the penalty language in the bill and asked DeSantis to what extent he thought women should be punished for violating the abortion ban.

“Not at all, no,” DeSantis responded. “I don’t think this is an issue about the woman. … At the end of the day, I would not support any penalties on a woman.”

More recently, the DeSantis campaign posted a clip from an event at Winthrop College in South Carolina on Oct. 19 in which DeSantis pushed back against the idea that the law he signed would lead to criminal prosecution of women who get abortions.

“Of course you’re not going to jail a woman,” DeSantis said. “We have a heartbeat bill in Florida. It has nothing to do with putting a woman in … it’s ridiculous that that would even be mentioned.”

When filing her bill to clarify that women cannot be criminally charged for violating the six-week ban, Book said “we’re not just going to take his [DeSantis’] word for it, we’re fighting to ensure it.” The bill would add language to the end of the section on penalties that states, “This paragraph does not apply to the pregnant woman who terminates the pregnancy.”

Democratic Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani, who opposed the six-week abortion ban and supports Book’s bill to clarify the language, said that despite DeSantis’ assurances, he can’t be trusted.

“Governor DeSantis can claim what he wants but what we know is that the law currently isn’t clear and he can’t be trusted on this issue,” Eskamani told us via email. “There is nothing in state statute or code that explicitly prevents a pregnant person from being criminalized. Anti-abortion lawmakers are constantly lying to voters and trying to downplay the harm of their policies, too. We have learned since the Dobbs decision that anti-abortion states will always find a way to criminalize people for their pregnancy decisions and outcomes.”

We asked DeSantis’ campaign if the governor would support the Book bill to clarify that women would not be criminally charged for violating the six-week ban, but we did not get a response on that question.

Case Law on the Issue

In his interview on “CBS Evening News,” DeSantis said that the issue of whether women could be prosecuted for violating abortion laws had been litigated, and that they cannot.

Although he did not expound, DeSantis appears to be referencing the case of Florida v. Ashley, involving an unwed teenager who shot herself in the abdomen while in the third trimester of pregnancy. She survived, but the fetus did not. She was prosecuted for manslaughter and third-degree murder, but the state Supreme Court ruled that she could not be criminally prosecuted.

“At common law, while a third party could be held criminally liable for causing injury or death to a fetus, the pregnant woman could not be,” the court wrote in 1997.

The court noted that the penalty section of a 1993 Florida law limiting abortions in the third trimester stated that, “Any person who willfully performs, or participates in, a termination of a pregnancy in violation of the requirements of this section is guilty of a felony of the third degree․” In its opinion, the state Supreme Court noted that “in order to overturn a long standing common law principle,” the state Legislature would have had to enact a statute that explicitly criminalized women who got an abortion in violation of the state statute. “Florida has not done so,” the court wrote.

So, since 1997, Florida has had similar language in its abortion laws, and no women in violation of those state laws have been criminally prosecuted. And there is no indication that the legislators who introduced the six-week ban intended for criminal penalties to apply to women who get abortions. A bill analysis in March, for example, only talks about amending the law “to prohibit a physician from knowingly performing or inducing an abortion after six weeks of gestation.”

The Newsom PAC ad relies on interpreting the phrasing “actively participates in” to mean that women who get abortions could be prosecuted. That hasn’t been established in the courts, and DeSantis has said repeatedly and unequivocally that that is not the meaning or intent of the law. Nonetheless, concerns about ambiguity in the wording of the law could be settled if the law were amended to add the language suggested by Book.

Nov 17 2023,Abortion Rights Group Launches Ballot Initiative in Nebraska,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/abortion-rights-group-launches-ballot-initiative-in-nebraska-5531140,"After a major victory in Ohio and past victory in deep red Kansas, petitioners in Nebraska are seeking to protect abortion as a constitutional right.

In 2024, Nebraska could be considering whether abortion should be a constitutionally protected right.

On Nov. 16, the abortion rights group Protect Our Rights formally launched a campaign to make Nebraskans consider whether the Cornhusker State will establish a constitutional right to abortion.

“Each person’s circumstances are different, and each pregnancy is unique,” Jasmine Smith, a full spectrum doula from Omaha and a Nebraska maternal health sworn sponsor of Protect Our Rights, said during a press conference announcing the initiative. “That is why it is so critical that decisions about pregnancy and abortion belong to pregnant Nebraskans and not politicians who don’t know anything about their lives and circumstances.”

According to documents from the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office, the proposed ballot measure will read: “All persons shall have a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions. Fetal viability means the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside of the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.”

The movement comes shortly after the Nebraska Legislature passed a law signed by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, a Republican, in May 2023 banning all abortions after 12 weeks . The law went into effect in October. The state’s law has exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergencies.

At the press conference, Andi Curry Grubb, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, said abortion care is constantly under threat in Nebraska. In the past two years, lawmakers attempted to ban it five times. Petitions Out Soon Anti-abortion groups, like the Nebraska Family Alliance, say the measure is vaguely worded, could allow late-term abortions, and will allow girls to get abortions without parental consent.

In an interview with The Epoch Times, Nebraska Family Alliance Executive Director Karen Bowling called the proposed ballot measure an initiative by Planned Parenthood North Central States and the ACLU of Nebraska.

“It’s an all-out attempt to legalize abortion until birth,” Ms. Bowling said.

Ms. Curry Grubb said she was not surprised to hear abortion opponents “already spreading lies.”

“This is a narrowly tailored right to abortion through fetal viability,” Ms. Curry Grubb said. “The other things being said about what it does are simply untrue.”

Under Nebraska law , Protect Our Rights and its allies will need to collect signatures from 10 percent of the state’s registered voters. Additionally, those signatures need to represent 5 percent of the registered voters in 38 of its 93 counties.

Ms. Bowling estimated about 122,000 validated signatures will be needed by July 2024. If that happens, it will be on the ballot in the November 2024 election.

“What’s happening is they are trying to bypass the legislative process and misinform the general public and so coerce people into not understanding and signing this,” Ms. Bowling said.

Ms. Curry Grubb said petitioners will be in the field as soon as next week.

“I have no doubt that we will succeed in this effort,” Ms. Curry Grubb said. “Together we are going to stop government overreach and give power back to the people.”

National Implications Nebraska could be one of a handful of states considering similar measures in 2024. Abortion rights groups are buoyed by the success of Nebraska could be one of a handful of states considering similar measures in 2024. Abortion rights groups are buoyed by the success of a high-profile election in Ohio, which will amend the Buckeye State’s constitution to establish a right to abortion. The hot-button topic will likely play a role in the presidential politics of 2024, too.

Ms. Bowling said her group will invest its time and treasure in opposing the measure. This will include print, broadcast, and non-traditional media spending and appearances to discourage signing the petition and, if it comes to it, voting against the measure.

She predicted her organization and its allies wouldn’t be the only spenders. Most of the money that flows into the election will come from out of the state. Principally, the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood as well as their affiliates, will spend heavily, she said.

In Ohio, according to the state fundraising database hosted by watchdog group Open Secrets, more than $54 million was raised to influence public opinion on the abortion ballot measure. About $19.3 million was raised in support, and about $34.7 million was raised in opposition.

In Ohio’s 2023 race , national and local ACLU groups gave more than $2.3 million to support the measure. National and local Planned Parenthood groups raised more than $1.8 million. By comparison, the Virginia-based group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America gave more than $13.3 million, and the Washington-based Concord Fund, which is affiliated with the Judicial Crisis Network, gave $16.9 million.

Unlike Ohio, Nebraska is a deeply red state. Nebraskans have voted for the Republican Party candidate in every presidential election since 1976. However, a ballot measure preventing an abortion ban passed in equally red Kansas in 2022.

At the press conference, Protect Our Rights members said they were highly encouraged by the results in Ohio as well as their polling data. They declined to share polls but said the actual results of the election in Ohio closely matched opinion polls predicting a win for the abortion right amendment.

“We’ve seen time and time again,” Ashlei Spivey, a leader in the group Protect Our Rights and executive director of Omaha advocacy group I Be Black Girl, said. “When you put abortion on the ballot, voters will protect their rights.” Abortion in Nebraska Ms. Bowling said there are currently three abortion clinics operating in Nebraska. Most are located less than an hour’s drive away from Omaha. Most of the abortions, she said, occur through chemical abortion drugs given to women by doctors or by Planned Parenthood. Chemical procedures are included in the state’s statistics.

According to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services’ Nebraska 2022 Statistical Report of Abortions, a total of 2,547 abortions were performed in that year, a decrease from 2,360 the previous year. The average age of the recipient was 26.5.

The reason most often given for the procedure was “no contraception used.” About 59.6 percent of recipients were listed as white and 21.9 percent as black or African American.

About 10 percent of the abortions performed in 2022 occurred after the 12th week of gestation."
Dec 27 2023,"Woman who set fire to Casper abortion clinic ordered to pay nearly $300,000",Casper Star-Tribune,center,https://trib.com/news/local/crime-courts/federal-arson-case-natrona-county-clinic/article_c643f37c-a4f5-11ee-8a5a-6f9f348cac05.html,"A 22-year-old woman who set fire to Wellspring Health Access in Casper last year — Wyoming’s only remaining abortion provider — was ordered Tuesday to pay almost $300,000 in restitution.

Lorna Green must pay $298,170.95 in restitution, a federal order shows. About 80% will be paid to Nationwide General Insurance Company, the clinic’s insurance provider. The remainder will be distributed to Julie Burkhart, the president of Wellspring Health Access, and to the building’s owner.

The restitution, which was the full amount requested by federal prosecutors, appears to cover about the total cost of the damage, the federal order shows. Earlier this year, Burkart said in a statement that the “heinous attack caused nearly $300,000 worth of damage.”

Green was also sentenced to five years in prison on the federal arson charge in September. The five-year sentence was the mandatory minimum while the maximum sentence is 20 years.

She “eagerly looks forward to a productive and peaceful life,” after serving her sentence, Ryan Semerad, Green’s attorney, said in emailed statement Wednesday.

“Lorna Green, while serving her sentence, has agreed to repay the damages she caused as part of her efforts to atone for her actions,” Semerad said.

She was taken into custody July 20 after pleading guilty in a Cheyenne courtroom, as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors. At the time, Green told United States Magistrate Judge Alan B. Johnson that she “deeply regrets” her actions.

On May 25, 2022, Green tried to burn down Wellspring Health Access, which was weeks away from opening at the time. It sits along East Second Street in the central part of Casper.

“Green stated she did not like abortion and was having nightmares which she attributed to her anxiety about the abortion clinic, so she decided to burn the building,” the federal complaint states.

It took almost 10 months to identify Green as the responsible party. Several tipsters identified Green after the reward was increased from $5,000 to $15,000 in March.

Green is serving her sentence at Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, which is a minimum-security women’s facility in West Virginia, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ inmate finder. She is expected to be released in October 2027.

Lauren Rankin, a spokesperson for Wellspring Health Access, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

Dec 07 2023,Court Allows Texas Woman Carrying Doomed Fetus to Get Abortion,Daily Beast,left,https://thedailybeast.com/court-allows-texas-woman-carrying-doomed-fetus-to-get-abortion,"In a historic ruling, a Texas judge has granted a pregnant woman’s request to block the state’s abortion ban and allow her to end her pregnancy.

Lawyers from the Center for Reproductive Rights petitioned the court Monday to allow Kate Cox, 31, to terminate her pregnancy after she learned the fetus had a fatal condition. Cox’s lawyers argued that continuing the pregnancy to term would jeopardize her health and could impact her future fertility.

""The idea that Miss Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said in Thursday, granting Cox's application for a temporary restraining order.

In order to reverse the decision, the Texas Attorney General’s Office would need to ask a higher court to overturn the emergency restraining order, according to the Texas Tribune.

The case is the first time a pregnant woman has sued to be able to obtain an abortion since before Roe v. Wade. The Supreme Court overturned Roe last summer, allowing Texas to pass a ban on abortions in almost all cases. The judge’s ruling also applies to Dr. Damla Karsan, a Houston OB/GYN who volunteered to perform the procedure.

Cox learned last month that her fetus suffered from Trisomy 18, a chromosomal anomaly that means the fetus would not survive long after birth. In a statement accompanying her lawsuit, Cox said it was “not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when.”

“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy,” she added. “I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy. I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer. I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health and a future pregnancy.”

Molly Duane, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights who argued at the hearing, said she was relieved by the ruling but that is was “unforgivable” her client had to “beg for healthcare in court.”

“What is happening in Texas right now is a human rights violation,” she said in a press call. “The state’s arguments today were callus in the extreme and show they don’t care whether people live or die, as long as they are forced to give birth.”

Texas law currently bans all abortions except when needed to save a pregnant patient’s life. Twenty women sued the state in July, alleging they were denied abortions for their medically complex pregnancies. A judge in that case ruled that doctors should be allowed to use their “good faith judgment” in deciding when to provide an abortion for medical reasons, but the state quickly appealed. The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments in that case, Zurawski v. Texas, last week.

Cox’s lawyers previously argued that she could not wait until a decision in the Zurawksi case.

“The court must urgently step in to protect Kate’s health,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement Monday. “Women like Kate should not be forced to go to court to protect her health and preserve her future fertility.”"
Dec 14 2023,Conflict of interest concerns raised with an Arizona Supreme Court over abortion law,Arizona's Family,center,https://azfamily.com/2023/12/15/conflict-interest-concerns-raised-with-an-arizona-supreme-court-over-abortion-law,"PHOENIX (3TV/CBS 5) - There are growing concerns over a possible conflict of interest being raised for an Arizona Supreme Court justice because his wife helped craft the 2022 abortion law.

The state supreme court was already down a justice this week after Bill Montgomery, citing consideration of the state’s judicial code of conduct guidelines, recused himself from one of the most consequential cases in state history. But should another one have stepped down for the same reason?

On Tuesday, the highest court in Arizona heard a pivotal abortion case involving a 2022 law that was co-sponsored by the wife of Justice Clint Bolick, Rep. Shawnna Bolick. The court is now looking at whether that law, which bans abortions after 15 weeks, supersedes a nearly 160-year-old law that prohibits almost all abortions.

Some believe Justice Bolick should have already recused himself from this important case. “It’s the appearance of impropriety that we’re always directed to avoid. Just look at it from a common sense point of view. If you were in dispute with somebody, a good faith dispute between reasonable people, I don’t think anybody would say they’d be okay with the spouse of their opponent being the judge who’s making the decision,” Phoenix attorney and former state lawmaker Diego Rodriguez said.

During this week’s hearing, neither Bolick nor the rest of the court appeared to tip their hand as to how they might rule. Justice Bolick explained why he didn’t recuse himself in this statement:

When my wife was first elected as a legislator, I worked closely with the Court’s ethics counsel to develop guidelines for disqualification consistent with my duty under Rule 2.7 of the Rules of Judicial Ethics to decide cases in which I do not have a conflict. In addition to disqualification rules that apply regardless of my wife’s elected status, such as when she is a party to litigation, I will recuse in any challenge to the constitutionality of a law in which I am aware that my wife was a prime sponsor or prominently identified as a supporter or opponent. Otherwise, I will not. See, e.g., Ariz. School Boards Ass’n v. State, 252 Ariz. 219 (2022) (striking down multiple provisions of the budget bill). I will recuse, and recently did, when the legislature or my wife’s chamber is a party or presents its views in an amicus brief. I will recuse if my wife has a personal stake in the outcome of a case, as I did when I learned she was copied on an email at issue in a public records lawsuit against the Senate when she was a member of the House. Ordinarily, I will not recuse when the question is how to interpret a statute, or how statutes interact, which is the question in countless cases that come before us. I never advise my wife on legislation, nor does she express her views on pending litigation to me or to members of the media or public (as many reporters are well-aware). We are both very conscious of our ethical boundaries and abide them scrupulously. This case involves statutory interpretation and does not challenge the constitutionality of the 15-week abortion limit, and thus presents no conflict of interest. I therefore have an ethical duty to participate.

Dec 06 2023,Abortion access resumes in Wisconsin after Dane Co. Judge's ruling,WTMJ 4 Milwaukee,center,https://tmj4.com/news/local-news/abortion-access-resumes-in-wisconsin-after-dane-co-judges-ruling,"SHEBOYGAN, Wis. — A new court ruling has restored abortion access across Wisconsin. A judge in Dane County ruled a state law enacted back in 1849 is not a ban on abortions.

Leaders with Planned Parenthood say they will resume abortion services in Wisconsin as soon as possible. They say the services are already available in Milwaukee and Dane Counties.

Attorney General Josh Kaul Celebrated his win in Dane County Court, “In this case, freedom wins, quality wins, and women's health wins. This is a momentous victory.”

Pro-Life Wisconsin director Dan Miller says the fight is far from over, and he looks forward to seeing an appeal, “What we're looking for is a win for babies inside of the womb.”

Before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade last year, abortion clinics operated in three of Wisconsin’s 72 Counties: Milwaukee, Dane, and Sheboygan. When the high court sent the issue of abortion back to individual states, abortion opponents believed an 1849 state law made the practice in Wisconsin illegal. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski had vowed to prosecute under that law. Then Kaul filed suit.

“Women in Wisconsin became less safe, less free, and less equal when they lost access to safe legal abortion,” said Josh Kaul, Wisconsin Attorney General.

A Dane County judge sided with Kaul Tuesday. She ruled the 1849 law refers only to ‘feticide’ not abortion. Feticide is defined as “the act of killing a fetus by assaulting and battering the mother.”

Abortion opponents like Miller read it differently, “The state legislature's website right next to 940.04 it says abortion, so I mean it couldn't be more clear.”

Kaul says this ruling takes away fear in women, who even have planned pregnancies, “What should be a joyous occasion for expecting parents have, for some people has been a source of fear and concern — worrying about what would happen if an unexpected complication arose.”

While Miller, views the issue in starkly different terms, “I think of the slaughter of innocence.”

Sheboygan County’s District Attorney Joel Urmansky sent us a statement on the ruling, saying he’s obligated to comply for now. But he plans to appeal the decision.

Dec 06 2023,Wisconsin judge upholds earlier ruling that state law permits abortions,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/chicago/news/wisconsin-judge-upholds-abortions,"CHICAGO (CBS/AP) -- Democrats in Wisconsin are applauding a court ruling allowing abortions to resume in the state.

Last summer, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v Wade reactivated a 1849 Wisconsin law that conservatives interpreted as banning abortion. Abortion providers in Wisconsin shut down out of fear of violating the ban.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit days after Roe v Wade was struck down, arguing the Wisconsin law was too old to enforce, and a separate 1985 law permitting abortions before fetuses can survive outside the womb trump the ban. Three doctors later joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, saying they fear being prosecuted for performing abortions.

In July, Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled the law prohibits someone from attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child but doesn't apply to consensual medical abortions. The ruling prompted Planned Parenthood to resume its abortion practice in Milwaukee and Madison in September for the first time since Roe v Wade was struck down.

Joel Urmanski, the Republican district attorney in Sheboygan County, where Planned Parenthood's third abortion clinic is located, had asked Schlipper to reconsider her the ruling.

Schlipper refused in a 14-page opinion issued Tuesday, writing that Urmanski failed to show how she misapplied state law or made any other mistake and declared that the plaintiffs had won the suit.

She declined the doctors' request, however, to issue an injunction prohibiting prosecutors from charging abortion providers. Prosecutors in Dane, Milwaukee and Sheboygan County have said they would abide by her ruling that state law permits consensual abortions, she noted.

""This is a major win for reproductive freedom in Wisconsin, and we are prepared to defend that victory in reproductive freedom as we move forward,"" Kaul said.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement Tuesday that it expects to resume abortion procedures at its facility in Sheboygan ""as soon as possible.""

Anti-abortion groups are expected to appeal Schlipper's ruling."

Dec 20 2023,Wisconsin district attorney appeals court decision allowing abortions to resume within state,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/wisconsin-district-attorney-appeals-court-decision-allowing-abortions-resume-state,"Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed a court ruling that declared a 1849 Wisconsin law does not prohibit abortions, allowing the resumption of abortions in the state.

The U.S. Supreme Court's June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade led to Planned Parenthood ceasing abortions in Wisconsin.

Planned Parenthood resumed abortion services in Madison and Milwaukee following the July ruling, with a Sheboygan clinic scheduled to reopen next week.

A Republican district attorney has appealed a court ruling that determined that an 1849 Wisconsin law does not ban abortions, a decision that cleared the way for abortions to resume in the state.

Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski on Tuesday appealed the ruling from a Dane County judge that said there is no state ban on abortions. The appeal was expected and the case is likely to ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Urmanski asked that the appeal be heard in the state's Waukesha-based 2nd District Court of Appeals, where three of the four judges are conservative. Appeals are heard by three-judge panels.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF WISCONSIN TO RESUME ABORTIONS IN SHEBOYGAN BEFORE YEAR'S END

Any appeal of a ruling there would go to the state Supreme Court, where liberals hold a 4-3 majority. The most recently elected liberal justice, Janet Protasiewicz, campaigned as a supporter of abortion rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion, led to Planned Parenthood stopping abortions in Wisconsin. The group cited the state's 1849 law, which was widely viewed as banning the procedure.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to overturn the ban, naming Urmanski in Sheboygan County and prosecutors in Dane and Milwaukee counties as defendants. Those are the counties where Planned Parenthood had clinics that offered abortions.

WI REPUBLICAN PROSECUTOR PLANS APPEAL IN STATE ABORTION CASE

Dane County Circuit Judge Dianne Schlipper ruled in July that the 1849 ban doesn’t use the term ""abortion"" and that the law therefore only prohibits attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child. She issued her final order earlier this month, which opened the door for the appeal.

Planned Parenthood reopened clinics in Madison and Milwaukee that perform abortions soon after the July ruling. A third clinic in Sheboygan is scheduled to reopen next week.

District attorneys in all three counties where the clinics are located, including Urmanski, have said they will abide by the judge's ruling while the case plays out.

Marquette University Law School polls conducted since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade have shown that a majority of Wisconsin residents opposed that ruling and support legalized abortion."
Nov 15 2023,Advocates launch ballot measure to protect abortion in Nebraska,Fox 4 Kansas City,center,https://fox4kc.com/politics/hill-politics/advocates-launch-ballot-measure-to-protect-abortion-in-nebraska,"Advocates in Nebraska are officially launching a campaign to put abortion protections on the ballot in 2024, joining activists in other red states seeking to expand access more than a year after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

Nebraska’s measure would establish a right to abortion prior to fetal viability and when needed to protect a patient’s life or health. Under the petition language, the patient’s health care provider would determine viability.

The initiative is led by a coalition called Protect Our Rights, which includes local organizations and affiliates such as Planned Parenthood North Central States, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska, I Be Black Girl and the Women’s Fund of Omaha.

Nebraska joins Arizona, Colorado, Florida, and Nevada in pursuing citizen-initiated abortion access campaigns in 2024.

“Our constitutional amendment is informed both by medical experts and where most Nebraskans are on this issue. Unlike the state officials working to totally ban abortion, we’re elevating the voices and lived experiences of Nebraskans who believe that pregnant people should be able to access needed care with compassion and privacy, free from political interference,” Ashlei Spivey, a member of Protect Our Rights’s executive committee and executive director of I Be Black Girl, said in a statement.

To place a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot requires valid signatures from 10 percent of the registered voters in the state — around 123,000, as of the most recent public data available.

In addition, signatures must be collected from 5 percent of the registered voters in 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.

Nebraska lawmakers in May passed a 12-week abortion ban as part of a broader bill that also bans gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The law effectively bans abortion nine to 10 weeks after fertilization, with exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, and to save the life of the mother.

It took effect Oct. 1.

Every state that put abortion on the ballot since the end of Roe has voted in favor of protecting access to the procedure in some way, including most recently Ohio, where 57 percent of voters approved a measure to protect abortion to the point of viability.

Ballot measure campaigns are expensive undertakings, and the campaigns for and against abortion language have drawn millions of dollars in outside spending.

Anti-abortion groups called the effort extreme and deployed a frequent attack line used any time abortion rights advocates want to expand access: that the measure would allow abortions literally until the end of pregnancy.

“Nebraska’s law currently allows abortion throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but that isn’t enough for the abortion industry and activists who are trying to write second- and third-trimester abortions into our constitution. This amendment would allow for abortion until the moment of birth,” Nebraska Right to Life Executive Director Sandy Danek said in a statement. “This ballot measure is not pro-choice, it’s pro-abortion, and it does not reflect the values of Nebraskans.”

Abortions occurring after viability, which is usually around 24 weeks, are extremely rare. Only about 1 percent occur after 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 93 percent are performed at or before 13 weeks."

Nov 15 2023,Petition seeks to enshrine abortion rights in Nebraska Constitution,Scottsbluff Star-Herald,center,https://starherald.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/nebraska-abortion-rights-petition-language/article_a2b442ce-692c-5f17-998d-07676e20ede9.html,"Abortion rights supporters are seeking to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution ""until fetal viability.""

That's according to the text of a proposed petition, which the group Protect Our Rights made public Wednesday morning.

The group, which includes the ACLU of Nebraska, I Be Black Girl, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, the Women's Fund of Omaha and Nebraska Appleseed, among others, filed their initiative plans with the Nebraska secretary of state a couple of weeks ago but did not reveal the proposed language.

The group defines fetal viability in its petition language as ""the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.""

The petition language also would ensure abortions are available ""when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions.""

“Our constitutional amendment is informed both by medical experts and where most Nebraskans are on this issue. Unlike the state officials working to totally ban abortion, we're elevating the voices and lived experiences of Nebraskans who believe that pregnant people should be able to access needed care with compassion and privacy, free from political interference,"" Ashlei Spivey, a member of Protect Our Rights’ executive committee and executive director of I Be Black Girl, said in a statement. ""This amendment will ensure that these personal decisions stay with Nebraskans — not politicians.”

Protect Our Rights plans to officially launch its petition drive Thursday in Omaha.

The group will need to collect signatures from 10% of Nebraska’s registered voters to get its constitutional amendment on the November 2024 ballot — a total that will require about 122,000 authorized signatures, including 5% of registered voters in at least 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.

The effort to put abortion access to voters next year comes six months after Nebraska's Legislature voted 33-15 to pass a bill that restricted access to abortion in the state from 20 weeks post-fertilization to 12 weeks based on gestational age.

Those restrictions, which took effect immediately, have been challenged in court, so far unsuccessfully. The legal challenge — currently pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court — claims the law violated the state Constitution’s single-subject rule because the bill that put the restrictions into place also banned gender-affirming surgeries for minors.

In the months since lawmakers passed the bill, Gov. Jim Pillen has pledged that he and his allies in the Legislature are “going to end” abortion at conception in Nebraska, indicating their push to restrict access to the procedure won't stop with bans at 12 or even six weeks.

Advocates, though, hope to halt further restrictions and reverse those already in place."
Dec 13 2023,Pregnant women take a leading role in new legal battles over abortion,Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/12/13/pregnant-women-take-leading-role-new-legal-battles-over-abortion,"Kate Cox caught the attention of the nation last week when she asked a Texas judge for permission to end her pregnancy. Three days later, a pregnant woman filed suit anonymously in Kentucky, arguing that the state’s near-total abortion ban violates her constitutional right to privacy and self-determination.

And across Texas, Tennessee and Idaho, several dozen women who had previously experienced pregnancy complications are awaiting decisions in a string of cases that could expand the health exceptions in their state abortion bans.

“I was condemned to endure both physical and emotional torture, knowing that I was going to deliver a stillborn,” said Nicole Blackmon, one of the plaintiffs suing Tennessee, when the lawsuit was announced in September. “I want some good to come out of my ordeal, so I am joining this case.”

The burst of lawsuits that put pregnant women front and center reflects a shift in approach by the abortion rights movement, which has long brought challenges through claims by clinics and doctors who remain affected by abortion restrictions beyond the narrow window during which patients would be seeking to end their pregnancies.

The strategy behind the new, high-profile lawsuits has both legal and political implications for the fate of abortion access in the ever-evolving aftermath of the fall of Roe v. Wade, according to experts tracking the cases. They enable advocacy groups to chip away at the new laws by highlighting particular circumstances that jeopardize the health of the mother — while compelling the courts, as well as the country, to reckon with some of the most harrowing consequences of abortion bans.

“For the past year and a half, what has resonated in the public consciousness is patient stories,” said David Cohen, a law professor at Drexel who specializes in constitutional law and gender. “It’s much more compelling when you have [Cox] as opposed to Planned Parenthood.”

It is not yet clear what long-term effects the cases brought by patients will have. When the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Cox on Monday night — soon after the 31-year-old left the state for an abortion — it set no precedent for future abortion cases, said Molly Duane, Cox’s lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights. The other cases, which are all still pending, could fundamentally change the way the exceptions in the bans are interpreted and applied — or, in the case of the Kentucky challenge, overturn the ban altogether.

Many of these patient-led cases center on the medical exceptions in state abortion bans. While the more than two dozen abortion bans enacted since the fall of Roe v. Wade all include some kind of exception for the mother’s life, the laws use ambiguous language, with many permitting abortions in a “medical emergency” without offering a concrete definition of that term. This ambiguity has led to patients being turned away from hospitals, with doctors fearful of the prison sentences they could face if they make the wrong call.

Since the Center for Reproductive Rights filed its first patient-led case to broaden medical exceptions in March, Duane said her email and voice mail have been flooded with messages from other women who have run up against an abortion ban, eager to tell their stories. Many had faced pregnancy complications and been denied care. Some, like Cox, reached out while they were still pregnant.

“She’s not the first person I’ve talked to in the middle of an emergency,” said Duane. “She’s just the first person who filed a lawsuit.”

Duane said she’s open to taking more cases for pregnant women seeking a court order for an abortion.

Cox, a mother of two, had sought an abortion after learning from her doctor that her fetus had a fatal genetic condition and that carrying the pregnancy to term could jeopardize her health and future fertility. The Texas Supreme Court late Friday night temporarily blocked a lower-court ruling that would have allowed Cox to get an abortion under the state’s near-total abortion ban, and later on Monday night, reversed the lower court’s decision.

Separately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a letter on Thursday threatened to take legal action if Cox had the procedure in the state, warning doctors and hospitals that anyone involved in performing an abortion for Cox would face “civil and criminal liability” that could include “first-degree felony prosecutions.” He contended that Cox’s case did not meet “all of the elements necessary to fall within an exception to Texas’ abortion laws” and that the judge was “not medically qualified to make this determination.”

Antiabortion advocates in Texas said they’re aware the public is not fully on board with their abortion ban — and that Cox’s case was deeply upsetting to many.

“After Ohio, Virginia and Kentucky, obviously there is a very volatile cultural conversation going on,” said John Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life, the state’s largest antiabortion organization, referring to Ohio’s abortion ballot measure and recent Republican losses at the ballot box, which many attributed to the abortion issue.

In the wake of the Cox case, Seago said, “we need to be clearer than ever that in these circumstances we value the life of the child no matter what the doctors are saying,” arguing that many doctors in Texas are abortion rights advocates.

There will almost certainly be more cases like Cox’s, said Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. At this point, he said, there isn’t a clear legal path to overturning many of the country’s abortion bans, including the one in Texas. In lieu of that kind of sweeping litigation, Vladeck said, abortion rights groups are doing what they can for individuals.

“One of the advantages of being able to challenge abortion bans on their face is that you can get courts to issue categorical rulings,” Vladeck said. “But when every case turns on an individual patient’s medical facts, there’s going to be no precedent at all.”

These kinds of cases can raise public awareness about how difficult it can be for women to utilize medical exceptions to state abortion bans. The women who testified in a Texas hearing in July captivated the country with their vivid testimony about the life-threatening pregnancy complications they faced — and what it was like to be denied care. Cox’s case went viral as it unfolded over the weekend and on Monday, covered extensively in the national media.

In terms of public opinion, “Kate Cox’s case was effective almost precisely because she lost,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California Davis who specializes in abortion law. “Many Americans were like, really? That’s not allowed under Texas law? The idea is to make real to Americans what this means.”

As the 2024 presidential election nears, Democrats will be eager to keep abortion in the news — an issue where President Biden’s position is more widely popular than that of former president Donald Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican nomination. Cases like Cox’s could help the American public understand the full ramifications of abortion restrictions, Duane said.

“If there is a national 15-week abortion ban, this is what the entire country would look like,” said Duane. “And I need people to understand that.”

After watching what happened to Cox, Duane said, fewer women might be willing to come forward, especially those who are actively pregnant. It’s a lot to ask someone to put their health on the line, she said, and wait for the court to make a decision about your medical care. If they have the option to leave the state, she said, many women with pregnancy complications would want to end their pregnancies as soon as possible.

Cox spent the whole weekend in bed, said Duane, who was in regular communication with her.

“She’d ask, ‘Have we heard from the court yet? Have we heard from the court yet?’” Duane said. “Who would sign up for that, especially now?”

The women who are able to pursue litigation typically have resources, Vladeck said — and options."
Nov 15 2023,Petition seeks to enshrine abortion rights in Nebraska Constitution,Lincoln Journal Star,not-yet-rated,https://journalstar.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/nebraska-abortion-rights-petition-language/article_eef8adbe-83bf-11ee-a279-07579f8e71ff.html,"Abortion rights advocates in Nebraska who are launching a ballot initiative campaign this week are seeking to enshrine ""a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability"" into the state's constitution, according to proposed policy language made public Wednesday.

The language — initially filed with Nebraska's secretary of state earlier this month by a coalition of advocates known as Protect Our Rights — will appear on petitions seeking to put the constitutional amendment before voters in November 2024.

The coalition leading the effort, which includes the ACLU of Nebraska, I Be Black Girl, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, the Women's Fund of Omaha and Nebraska Appleseed, among others, plans to formally launch their petition drive Thursday in Omaha.

Advocates will need to collect signatures from 10% of Nebraska’s registered voters to get the would-be amendment on the ballot next November — a total that will require about 122,000 authorized signatures, including 5% of registered voters in at least 38 of Nebraska’s 93 counties.

The proposed policy language does not set a specific timeline for when abortion would be illegal under the amendment but defines fetal viability as ""the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.""

If it reaches the ballot and is approved by voters, the amendment would also ensure abortions are available ""when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions.""

""This amendment will ensure that these personal decisions stay with Nebraskans — not politicians,"" Ashlei Spivey, a member of Protect Our Rights’ executive committee and executive director of I Be Black Girl, said in a statement Wednesday.

The proposed policy invokes similar language as the constitutional amendment voters in Ohio supported last week that allows the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability, which is generally considered to be six months of pregnancy or about 22-24 weeks gestation.

The proposed language prompted immediate backlash from Gov. Jim Pillen and his conservative allies in the Legislature, who in April voted 33-15 to pass a bill that restricted access to abortion in the state to 12 weeks based on gestational age. State law previously allowed abortions up until 20 weeks post-fertilization.

""Bottom line: it's very vague, it's very open,"" Pillen told reporters Wednesday, suggesting ""fetal viability"" could be defined ""a lot of different ways.""

""I'm gonna fight it with every ounce of energy that I have because what it will lead to, if enacted, it will lead to doctors deciding — women deciding, doctors deciding whether a baby being born at 39 weeks can live or not,"" he said.

""We are a pro-life state. There's no Nebraskans that are gonna support that petition and we're gonna make sure they understand the truth of the language in it.""

State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston, who proposed a six-week ban that was narrowly blocked in the Legislature this year before the body ultimately passed the 12-week ban, called the petition language ""extreme"" and said current law already provides exceptions for the life of the mother and medical emergencies throughout pregnancy.

""An amendment that jeopardizes the health and safety of women and abandons babies who deserve love and protection to painful late-term abortion procedures must be rejected,"" she said in a press release.

A coalition of anti-abortion advocates called the Nebraska Pro-Life Coalition, which is made up of Nebraska Right to Life, the Nebraska Catholic Conference, the Nebraska Family Alliance and Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, lodged similar objections in a joint statement Wednesday.

Abortion rights advocates have framed the issue as unpolitical, pointing to the success of the abortion rights ballot initiative last week in Ohio — the seventh state where voters have decided to protect abortion access in the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022 — as evidence that the fight over abortion access is not an inherently political issue.

But the looming ballot initiative campaign in Nebraska will nonetheless pit advocates against Pillen and his political allies who championed the passing of the state's 12-week ban in April.

Those restrictions, which took effect immediately, have been challenged in court, so far unsuccessfully. The legal challenge — currently pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court — claims the law violated the state Constitution’s single-subject rule because the bill that put the restrictions into place also banned gender-affirming surgeries for minors.

“Unlike the state officials working to totally ban abortion, we're elevating the voices and lived experiences of Nebraskans who believe that pregnant people should be able to access needed care with compassion and privacy, free from political interference,"" Spivey said in her statement Wednesday.

She said the amendment is ""informed both by medical experts and where most Nebraskans are on this issue.""

The group's filings with Secretary of State Bob Evnen's office list three formal sponsors of the proposed amendment: Dr. Andy Robertson, an Elkhorn-based maternal and fetal medicine specialist; Dr. Carolyn Maud Doherty, an OB-GYN in Omaha, and Jasmine Smith, a birth and postpartum pregnancy loss support provider who also lives in Omaha.

The coalition has commissioned a poll to test Nebraskans' view on the issue but haven't published results of that effort.

Campaign finance reports the group filed with the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission indicate the Washington, D.C.-based organization The Fairness Project paid a California polling firm nearly $54,000 to conduct the poll on behalf of the Nebraska coalition.

Protect Our Rights' latest campaign finance statement, which the group filed in late October, suggests that it has around $43,000 in cash on hand and has so far been funded primarily by the ACLU of Nebraska, which gave $25,000 to the coalition in September and again in October."

Oct 31 2023,New abortion laws temporarily blocked in Kansas,KWCH,center,https://kwch.com/2023/11/01/new-abortion-laws-temporarily-blocked-kansas,"WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - In the latest legal challenge to Kansas abortion laws, a judge has blocked the state from enforcing measures that date back two decades. It’s another victory for abortion rights supporters after voters last year maintained the state’s constitutional right to abortion.

The temporary injunction was prompted by a lawsuit filed earlier this year by Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights. The injunction will remain in place until the court hears this case in June 2024.

Wichita State graduate student Delaney Jones has spent the last few years working on issues around reproductive rights in Kansas. The vice president of Wichita State FOCUS (Feminists on Campus Uniting Students), a campus chapter of URGE, said she advocates for reproductive equity and abortion access.

“(It) can be monotonous and oftentimes boring, but there are times like these directly affecting you and your loved ones, and you really need to pay attention,” Jones said.

In those last few years, a lot has changed around the landscape of abortion in the U.S. and Kansas. One of the things she’s focused on is access to medication abortion.

“The access to that is absolutely crucial. In spaces like Kansas, where abortion is still legal, we only have clinics in the Wichita area, Johnson County area. So, for rural folks and low-income folks or folks without the ability to travel far distances to get to these clinics, the ability to self-manage these abortions through medication at home is absolutely critical,” said Jones.

As she watched that change, another development on Monday with a temporary injunction issued by Johnson County District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram.

“Although that injunction is temporary, it is extremely important, andI’m glad it’s out there to bring attention to what is in place already in Kansas,” Jones said.

The judge’s injunction blocks the state from enforcing a handful of state abortion laws, including the 24-hour waiting period, which dates back to the 1990s. It also covers information providers are to tell patients their patients about risks of an abortion, which providers say is inaccurate. The injunction blocks a new law requiring providers to say medication abortion is reversible, something abortion rights supporters and the judge in the injunction say is not based on scientific evidence.

Judge Jayaram wrote, “There is no credible scientific/medical evidence that the “reversal” therapy proposed in the Amendment actually “reverses” the effects of mifepristone. Indeed, the overwhelming weight of credible evidence, given this record, suggests that such a theory is misleading, untested, potentially dangerous for women, and speculative.”

“I hope this conversation pushes people to ask why. ‘Why is this here? Who is making these laws?’ Allowing lawmakers to decide what we do with our bodies, rather than our physicians and ourselves,” said Jones.

Abortion rights opponents have criticized the injunction.

The Kansas Catholic Conference calls it a devastating ruling that “ignores science, harms women and destroys innocent life. The Catholic Church in Kansas will persevere in our efforts to authentically and compassionately meet the needs of women experiencing an unplanned pregnancy.”

A statement for Kansas House Republican Leadership said, “For over 25 years, The Women’s Right to Know Act has empowered and protected vulnerable Kansas women who are considering a pregnancy termination by providing valuable information that is often withheld by the for-profit abortion industry. Informed consent is an integral part of any doctor-patient relationship and abortion is no exception. Sadly, this court decision temporarily erases common sense protections for the mother such as the right to an ultrasound at no cost, the right to know the infant’s gestational age, and the right to know whether the abortion provider has received any disciplinary actions by the state board of healing arts.”

To support issuing the injunction, Judge Jayaram cited the right to abortion granted by the Kansas Constitution, which the public vote last year upheld.

“The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue. Nevertheless, the State’s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights. The State may pick a side and viewpoint, but in doing so, it may not trespass upon the natural, inalienable rights of the people. In this case, the preliminary record before the Court demonstrates that the provisions at issue invade and unconstitutionally infringe upon Kansans’ fundamental rights under Section 1 and 11 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights,” cited Judge Jayaram.

This is just one of the legal challenges ongoing against the state’s abortion laws. Earlier this year, challenges went before the Kansas Supreme Court.

While the future of some of Kansas’s abortion laws awaits the courts, Jones is continuing her work advocating for reproductive rights and educating and engaging her fellow students.

“While it’s legally protected, I think having more conversations about abortion and the stigma around it, how do we destigmatize it both socially and politically and how that can further legislation about it,” said Jones. “Increasing the accessibility to medication abortions. For many people, there’s a price issue there. A lot of abortions in the area can range from $600 to $1,000, which is not feasible to allow most people to pay for out-of-pocket.”

Dec 12 2023,Kentucky woman asks court for abortion; embryo no longer has cardiac activity,Wish TV,center,https://wishtv.com/news/politics/kentucky-woman-asks-court-for-abortion-embryo-no-longer-has-cardiac-activity,"Kentucky woman asks court for abortion; embryo no longer has cardiac activity

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — A pregnant woman in Kentucky who filed a lawsuit demanding the right to an abortion has learned her embryo no longer has cardiac activity, her attorneys said Tuesday.

The plaintiff’s attorneys signaled their intent to continue the challenge to Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban, but did not immediately comment on what effect the development would have on the lawsuit.

The complaint was filed last week in a state court in Louisville. The plaintiff, identified only as Jane Doe, was seeking class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion. The suit filed last week said she was about eight weeks pregnant.

The flurry of individual women petitioning a court for permission for an abortion is the latest development since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. The Kentucky case is similar to a legal battle taking place in Texas, where Kate Cox, a pregnant woman with a likely fatal condition, launched an unprecedented challenge against one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.

But unlike the Texas case, little is known about the Kentucky plaintiff. Her attorneys have insisted they would fiercely protect their client’s privacy, stressing that Jane Doe believes “everyone should have the right to make decisions privately and make decisions for their own families,” Amber Duke, executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said last week. Her legal team also declined to disclose whether Jane Doe still needed an abortion.

Instead, Jane Doe’s attorneys urged other women who are pregnant and seeking an abortion in the Bluegrass State to reach out if they are interested in joining the case. The lawsuit says Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban violates the plaintiff’s rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

“Jane Doe sought an abortion in Kentucky, and when she could not get one, she bravely came forward to challenge the state’s abortion ban,” ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project deputy director Brigitte Amiri said in a statement. “Although she decided to have an abortion, the government denied her the freedom to control her body. Countless Kentuckians face the same harm every day as the result of the abortion ban.”

According to court documents, Jane Doe had a medical appointment Dec. 8 — after the lawsuit was filed — where no cardiac activity was discovered after an ultrasound was performed.

In the Texas case, Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had been seeking court permission to end her pregnancy in a state where abortion is only allowed in narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger — not for fetal anomalies. Before the Texas Supreme Court on Monday rejected Cox’s request, her attorneys said she had left the state to get an abortion elsewhere because she could not wait any longer due to concerns that remaining pregnant would jeopardize her health and her ability to have more children.

While Cox is believed to be the first to make such a request, her legal team and other experts anticipate other challenges among the dozen of other GOP-controlled states where abortion is largely prohibited at all stages of pregnancy. Meanwhile, a handful of separate legal challenges are taking place across the country highlighting the stories from women who were denied abortions while facing harrowing pregnancy complications.

Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Supreme Court refused to halt the state’s near-total abortion ban and another outlawing abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. The justices focused on narrow legal issues but did not resolve larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the state.

The legal challenge revolves around Kentucky’s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban — both passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. It bans abortions except when they are carried out to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature in chipping away at the state’s anti-abortion laws.

As a result of the ruling, patient-led challenges “are our only path forward to strike down the bans under the right to privacy and right to self-determination,” Amiri said.

“We will do everything we can to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” she said.

Attorneys for the woman, who goes by Jane Doe in the lawsuit, told The Associated Press they intend to continue their challenge of Kentucky's near-total abortion ban. But they did not immediately comment when The Courier Journal asked about what effect her new condition would have on the case.

The lawsuit was filed Dec. 8 in a state court in Louisville, The Courier Journal previously reported. The woman filed the lawsuit on behalf of herself and any other person who is pregnant or could become pregnant and would want to get an abortion. The woman is eight weeks pregnant but wants to terminate it and cannot do so in Kentucky because of abortion bans that took effect last year.

The lawsuit says Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban violates the plaintiff’s rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

Joining in the suit are Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, which is being represented by an attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Craig Henry PLC, and O'Melveny & Myers LLP.

Dec 12 2023,Whitmer’s push for abortion rights continues as she repeals insurance requirement in Michigan,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/12/12/politics/whitmer-michigan-abortion-insurance/index.html,"CNN —

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday signed the final piece of the state’s Reproductive Health Act into law, which repealed a requirement for a separate insurance rider for abortion coverage.

The move comes after voters enshrined abortion rights to the battleground state’s constitution in last year’s midterm elections, and ahead of 2024, when Democrats will continue to highlight the issue.

Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade last year, abortion rights has become a driving force to the ballot box. Democratic candidates, including Whitmer during her 2022 reelection campaign, have made the issue a central part of their pitch. And voters, in turn, have consistently chosen to protect abortion rights and picked candidates who support those rights.

“Today, 10 years after I gave a speech on the Senate floor and shared my own story as a survivor of sexual assault, I am honored as governor to repeal the ban on insurance coverage for abortion,” Whitmer posted on X after signing the bill.

“The moral of the story is, never stop fighting for what you know is right,” she said in the post.

Per the state, of the more than 27,000 abortion that took place in Michigan last year, only 2.5% were paid for by insurance. The vast majority were self-paid.

The controversial insurance rider requirement was approved in 2013 by the then-Republican-led legislature.

Whitmer, then the state Senate minority leader, spoke against it at the time and revealed her own personal story.

“The Republican male majority continues to ignorantly and unnecessarily weigh in on important women’s health issues that they know nothing about,” she said, according to MLive.com.

Whitmer has long been a vocal supporter of abortion rights. Six months after she won reelection and Democrats took control of the state legislature, the governor signed legislation repealing a 1931 abortion ban in Michigan – one that she had challenged even ahead of the overturning of Roe.

In August, Whitmer said many “bad laws” were still in place which “put politically motivated, medically unnecessary restrictions on abortion.”

A new CNN poll released this week found that in a hypothetical rematch, former President Donald Trump had 50% support of registered voters in Michigan while President Joe Biden had 40%. Biden had flipped the state in 2020 after it voted for Trump four years earlier.

Biden, like his fellow Democrats, plans to highlight abortion rights as he seeks reelection in 2024. His campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, told CNN earlier this year that the president will continue to focus on “efforts that are helping motivate and mobilize voters right now” – like abortion access – as he looks toward reelection.

Oct 31 2023,State restrictions on abortion blocked by judge in Kansas,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/oct/31/state-restrictions-on-abortion-blocked-by-judge,"TOPEKA, Kan. -- A Kansas judge on Monday put a new state law on medication abortions on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies.

The ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in Kansas, where a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram's order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years. The waiting period had been in place since 1997.

""The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue,"" Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. ""Nevertheless, the State's capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights.""

Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions.

""Each day these restrictions were in effect, we have been forced to turn away patients for reasons that are medically wrong and ethically unjustifiable,"" said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates three Kansas clinics providing abortion services.

The legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion. In August, a judge in Texas ruled that the state's ban was too restrictive, and the Utah Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions.

""These kinds of informed consent laws reflect the long-standing will of the people of Kansas,"" Caleb Dalton, senior counsel for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is helping the state defend its anti-abortion laws, said in a statement. ""Kansans are right to want to protect maternal health and safety and the lives of the unborn, and we will continue defending their interests.""

Kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with Republican-controlled legislatures. The state Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a ""fundamental"" right. GOP lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn't grant a right to abortion -- and in the August 2022 vote, that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin, upholding abortion rights.

ARIZONA APPEAL

A federal appeals court has agreed to give abortion rights advocates a chance to revive their bid to block an Arizona law that makes it a felony for doctors to perform abortions on patients seeking the procedure solely because of a fetal genetic abnormality, such as Down syndrome.

In an order issued Monday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to a lower court to consider the doctors' request for a court order blocking the law. The appeals court didn't rule on the merits of the challenge but concluded nonetheless that the doctors had legal standing to make the request.

The three-judge panel said the doctors believe they would be targeted for prosecution, given that at least one of the state's 15 county prosecutors intends to enforce the law, and that the doctors had shown they suffered economic losses by complying with the law.

""Even if the regulations were crystal clear, plaintiffs would still lose revenue from the abortions that they can no longer provide,"" the court wrote.

The law makes it a felony punishable by four to 24 months behind bars for doctors to perform abortions if they know patients are seeking the procedure only because of a genetic abnormality in a fetus.

U.S. District Judge Douglas Rayes had blocked the ban in September 2021 in a lawsuit by the three obstetrician-gynecologists who perform abortions and a physicians' association. He concluded the statute's criminal provisions were likely unconstitutionally vague and said it was unclear at what point in the process doctors can be deemed to be aware that a fetal genetic abnormality exists.

But the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out the order and sent the case back to Rayes, who had written his ruling before the nation's highest court in June 2022 overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion.

Rayes issued a new ruling in January, saying this time that the conduct the challengers claim to have been chilled from engaging in isn't constitutionally protected anymore. The judge also said doctors don't have a right to carry out elective abortions and their patients no longer have a right to receive them.

Nov 24 2023,Nevada Judge Rejects Attempt to Make Abortion a Constitutional Right,HotAir,right,https://hotair.com/headlines/2023/11/24/nevada-judge-rejects-attempt-to-make-abortion-a-constitutional-right-n594477,"In October, the Coalition for Parents and Children (CPC) PAC filed a lawsuit against a petition by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom (NRF) to put an amendment on the ballot that protects access to abortion and birth control, and prenatal and postpartum care, according to The Hill. Carson City District Court Judge James Russell said that he was dismissing the petition because it did not focus on just abortion and, therefore, violated the “single subject rule,” according to the ruling.

“This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Petition embraces a multitude of subjects that amount to logrolling,” Russell wrote. “Subsection 1, alone, embraces the following subjects: prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage, and infertility care … Thus, it is improper to characterize these broad categories as a ‘single subject’ because there is no explanation as to how these provisions are functionally related.”

[This is more procedural than substantive. If the NRF stuck to abortion alone in a ballot petition, that would pass muster in court and proceed to the voters. However, as Life News points out, abortion is already legal in Nevada through 24 weeks, so any attempt at such a petition on abortion alone would likely be very unpopular — which is why the BRF freighted it with other issues that have more popular support. — Ed]"
Dec 11 2023,Texas Supreme Court Overrules ‘Medical Emergency’ Exception for Woman Seeking Abortion,NTD,right,https://ntd.com/texas-supreme-court-overrules-medical-emergency-exception-for-woman-seeking-abortion_959879.html,"Texas’s Supreme Court has officially reversed a lower court’s ruling allowing a woman to obtain an emergency abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception.

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old Texan woman, sued the state last week for the right to have an abortion at 20 weeks because her unborn baby was diagnosed with Trisomy 18, a condition that causes multiple structural abnormalities and is usually fatal to the baby before birth or within the first year of life, according to MedlinePlus.

In her lawsuit, filed on her behalf by the Center for Reproductive Rights, several doctors also told Ms. Cox that continuing to carry the pregnancy to term could threaten her health and future fertility.

A lower-court judge initially granted Ms. Cox’s request for access to an emergency abortion; however, the state Supreme Court paused the ruling on Dec. 9, only a day later. The Texas Supreme Court has since overturned the verdict entirely.

According to the Dec. 11 ruling, Justice Jimmy Blacklock and Justice John Devine wrote that while the plaintiff makes a case that her doctor, Dr. Damla Karsan, believes she qualifies for a medical exception. “But when she sued seeking a court’s pre-authorization, Dr. Karsan did not assert that Ms. Cox has a ‘life-threatening physical condition’ or that, in Dr. Karsan’s reasonable medical judgment, an abortion is necessary because Ms. Cox has the type of condition the exception requires,” the Justices wrote.

“No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated,” they continued. But they ultimately decided in their ruling, “Difficulties in pregnancy, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother [that] the exception encompasses.”

Texas’s strict abortion access laws prohibit and criminalize abortions except in cases of “medical emergency,” defined as when reasonable medical judgment finds that a “pregnant female … has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”

Some doctors and other critics of the law argue the exceptions are too vague and force them to wait until their patients get sick enough to intervene.

Pro-choice advocates argue for legal access to abortion services, including elective abortion, especially in cases where the mother’s health could be at risk by continuing with the pregnancy. In contrast, pro-life groups argue on moral and religious grounds that life is sacred and that the unborn should also be extended protection by law.

Cox Leaves Texas

Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, revealed that before the Texas ruling and after a “week of legal whiplash and threats of prosecution from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton,” Ms. Cox has left the state.

After the lower-court order in Ms. Cox’s favor, Mr. Paxton threatened legal action against any doctors who performed an abortion, stating that the initial ruling would not “insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws.” According to Mr. Paxton, breaking the abortion ban law could include first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of not less than $100,000 for each violation.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate; her health is on the line,” Ms. Northup said.

“She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer. This is why judges and politicians should not be making healthcare decisions for pregnant people, they are not doctors. ”

According to Ms. Northup, the whole affair is the result of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade last year, which gave states the right to determine their own laws for regulating abortions. She argues that now, “women are forced to beg for urgent healthcare in court,” and the exceptions in place “don’t work.”

The Texas Supreme Court recently heard arguments in Zurawski v. the State of Texas, a different case filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of 20 women who were denied abortions in Texas while experiencing what were described as severe and dangerous pregnancy complications.

In this case, they asked the Court for clarity on the meaning of the medical exception in the state’s abortion bans. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, Ms. Cox’s “situation underscores the need for that clarity.”

The Epoch Times sought further comment from Ms. Cox. The Center for Reproductive Rights has said she is unavailable for media interviews at this time.

Dec 11 2023,"WyoProfile: Judge Melissa Owens, arbiter of Wyoming’s abortion ban suit - WyoFile",WyoFile,right,https://wyofile.com/wyoprofile-judge-melissa-owens-arbiter-of-wyomings-abortion-ban-suit,"On July 27, 2022, only seven months after her appointment to the district court bench in Teton County, Judge Melissa Owens blocked Wyoming’s abortion ban hours after it went into effect.

Until that time, she had worked in relative obscurity — at least outside of legal circles — as a defense attorney, prosecutor, private practice lawyer and municipal judge. Suddenly, she found herself overseeing what has since become a 17-month legal battle over the future of abortion rights in Wyoming, including a first-of-its-kind attempt to ban medication abortions.

Twice state lawmakers have attempted to ban nearly all abortions in Wyoming. And in both instances, Owens halted their implementation while weighing their constitutionality.

The latest iteration of the lawsuit challenging Wyoming’s abortion bans is still playing out, with a major hearing set for Thursday in Jackson.

While far right lawmakers have labeled her a judicial activist, those who know her say she’s well suited to oversee the most controversial court case in Wyoming since a judge in 2014 legalized same-sex marriage. Friends and colleagues describe her as an intelligent, generous person with a great sense of humor who will follow the law.

“I don’t like partisan politics. I don’t like personal politics,” said Jackson Town Councilman Jim Rooks. “So it should be no surprise that I’m a huge fan of Judge Owens. And not because of my personal feelings about some of the issues that she’s had to weigh in on, but just because of the manner in which I’ve seen her perform.”

Wyoming raised

Owens spent her teen years in Jackson, one of seven kids raised by Brenda and Richard Mulligan. Much of the family moved there from New Brunswick, New Jersey, where her dad worked as an attorney and served as mayor.

Rooks met Owens growing up in Jackson, though she was a bit older than him.

“She’s just extraordinary,” he said. “She’s funny. She has an incredible sense of humor, really colorful personality. Sneaky smart … She’s such a people person, her sense of humor, and I think it’s easy for some folks to miss how incredibly intelligent she is.”

Owens, whose assistant said she was unable to comment for this story, earned her Bachelor of Arts degree at Rollins College in Florida followed by a law degree at the University of Wyoming in 1998.

Casper attorney Pam Brondos remembers meeting Owens their freshman year of law school. They’ve been friends for nearly 30 years since.

“I think of fun and smiles and good times with Melissa,” she said, recalling Owens’ good-faith teasing.

Owens somehow balanced a personal life with her education, Brondos recalled.

“I always admired that, that she was always able to kind of keep a little bit of reality when we were in law school,” she said.

Owens is tough and independent, Brondos added. At the same time, she said, Owens is very active in her family’s life and will drop everything to help a friend.

“She’s probably one of the most generous people I’ve ever met,” Brondos said. “We lost a really good friend, a law school classmate a couple years ago, Angela Dougherty. And Melissa was right there, getting a hold of all our close friends and classmates and just kind of being that glue that held us together through that grief.”

Owens once wrote for Wyoming Lawyer that she believed in helping other lawyers “at any time, whether it’s talking through a case or sharing my forms. I believe we should all help each other to be the best we can be, especially in this great state.”

“I think it’s easy for some folks to miss how incredibly intelligent she is.” Jim Rooks

“My father told me if I wanted to practice in Wyoming, I should attend U.W. Law School because I would have friends and colleagues all over the state,” she added. “And he was right!”

After law school, Owens worked as a deputy public defender in Dallas while her husband went to graduate school there.

She recalled one funny instance working there. Owens wrote that she had told a client to dress for trial like she would for church.

“So she showed up in a canary yellow sweat suit, and even worse, it was fashioned out of material that made scratching and swishing noises with every step she took.”

Then, it was back to Jackson to work as a deputy prosecuting attorney with the Teton County Attorney’s Office and later in private practice.

“I started my own private practice because my family is my priority,” she wrote in a blog post when she was still in that practice. “I have a wonderful balance and I hope that I inspire other attorneys to do the same.”

At that time, she was also a district court commissioner, circuit court magistrate, substance abuse treatment court magistrate, a fee dispute arbitrator for the Wyoming Bar and served on the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee for the bar.

Then in 2014, she started working as a part-time municipal court judge in Jackson.

“I appointed Melissa because I trusted her judgment,” said former Jackson Mayor Mark Barron. “I found her thoughtful and deliberative. She seemed to be motivated by law, not politics and personalities. And she did a great job for the town.”

As a municipal judge, Owens also earned the friendship of Chief Municipal Court Clerk Jessica Chitwood, who’d started work there the same year.

“On top of everything else she was doing, anytime anybody asks her for help or to mentor or if an intern is looking for something, you know, she’s always ‘yes, absolutely, come in,’” Chitwood said. “She’s lovely.”

Chitwood recalls how Owens would ask about her and her family and make sure folks took a break if they had a long, hard day.

Chitwood misses Owens in the office, she said, but is glad she got the promotion to district court. Now, Chitwood said, she sometimes sees Owens in their shared parking lot and gives her a hug, weighted with concerns.

“I do worry for her and her safety,” she said. “And I really hope that everybody else sees her as she’s doing her job. She is doing it to the best of her skills and judgment and reason.”

Judging Jackson

While still practicing as an attorney, Owens volunteered for the student civics education program We The People, which Jackson Councilman Rooks ran at the time.

Of all the people on Teton County’s bar association roster — of which Rooks recalled a few hundred — he said Owens was the most generous with her time.

“She was just amazing. She’d come in whenever I’d asked her, as many times as she could,” he said. “She was so down to earth and would just talk to them on their level, and give examples from her life and get them to connect it to their lives, and just never took herself too serious[ly] and got them laughing. And they loved her.”

Rooks is now a local politician, but at the time he ran the civics program, he was a teacher.

While Rooks knew Owens growing up, they’re much closer now. She still likes being involved in her kids’ lives and outdoor sports, he said.

“Little known fact: She’s a badass water skier,” he said. “Her whole family is.”

In December 2021, Gov. Mark Gordon appointed Owens to the district court bench, stating “Melissa’s breadth of experience made her uniquely suited for the job.” He later told the Jackson Hole News & Guide “Judge Owens is going to be phenomenal.”

“I look forward to serving the citizens of Teton County with the same sense of ethics, temperament and wisdom that Judge Timothy Day has demonstrated in this position,” Owens said in her own statement at the time.

“I started my own private practice because my family is my priority.” Melissa Owens

Some perceive a bias in having a judge in Jackson — a blue dot in Wyoming’s red landscape — oversee this contentious abortion suit. (At the time the suit was filed, Jackson was home to Wyoming’s only clinic offering abortions.)

The Wyoming Freedom Caucus has called Owens a “judicial activist,” citing the temporary restraining order she once placed on the state’s near-total abortion ban. Owens has ruled in favor of the bans’ challengers more often than not, most recently allowing their use of expert witnesses and testimony.

In explaining her rulings to stall both abortion bans, Owens cited the likelihood of the case against the bans ultimately succeeding. She then referenced the amendment to the Wyoming’s Constitution that grants residents a right to make their own health care decisions, subject to “reasonable and necessary” legislative restrictions. The state’s legal counsel disagrees that the bans violate that section of the constitution.

Mention the accusations of judicial bias to Rooks and he’s quick to defend his home town and many of the people who live there, including Owens. As for himself, Rooks said he’s a “fierce independent” whose family includes a football coach, oil rig workers, ranchers and hunting guides.

Rooks argues that Owens remains a strict constitutionalist.

“She’s interpreting the Wyoming State Constitution,” he said. “And I think that history will show she’s doing it in an accurate manner. If they want to amend the Wyoming State Constitution, there [are] routes to do that.”

Freedom Caucus Chairman Rep. John Bear (R-Gillette) did not respond to WyoFile’s request for comment on his organization’s assertion that Owens is an activist judge.

To make that kind of claim, there has to be evidence, Rooks countered.

“I’m a politician, I know it’s easy for the social media warriors and even elected politicians to make claims,” he said. “Judicial activism, this is a common claim we hear, right? Prove it.”

Casper attorney Brondos agreed, calling the criticism a “knee-jerk reaction” that shows critics’ ignorance. She added that Owens was the right person for this particularly hard job of overseeing such a contentious issue.

“Melissa has the ability to avoid the noise around this case, and I think a lot of other attorneys or judges may not,” she said. “Melissa will follow the law, and I have no doubt that she’s going to make her decision and not be influenced with what’s happening within the political sphere.”

At the same time, Brondos said no matter what Owens rules, no judge wants a decision reversed.

“Having clerked for district court judges and having practiced for 25 years in front of judges, judges don’t like to have their decisions overturned by the Supreme Court,” Brondos said. “Melissa is going, and particularly in this case, she’s going to be as reasoned and follow the law as closely as she can.”

For Bob McLaurin, former Jackson town manager, his description of Owens echoed what her many friends said, adding “she’s got broad shoulders, so she’ll do just fine.”

It’s a description her dad — a long-time Jackson attorney — once used about himself, someone Owens has said she’s long listened to. He was the one who urged her to find balance in her work and life, she once wrote.

“Friends would describe me as funny,” she wrote in 2018. “I love to make people laugh and to laugh at myself. It’s important not to take yourself too seriously.”"
Dec 11 2023,Kate Cox leaves state for abortion while case waits in Supreme Court,KXAN News,not-yet-rated,https://kxan.com/news/texas/kate-cox-leaves-state-for-abortion-while-case-waits-in-supreme-court,"On Monday evening, the Texas Supreme Court issued an opinion blocking the lower court’s ruling the woman could get an abortion in Texas.

AUSTIN (Nexstar) — The 31-year-old Dallas woman at the center of a challenge to Texas’ abortion ban was forced to leave the state for an abortion as she awaited action on her case in the state Supreme Court, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.

Last week, a Travis County court ruled Kate Cox could receive an abortion under the medical exceptions in Texas’ ban. Cox received a fatal fetal diagnosis at 20 weeks of pregnancy called trisomy 18. The fetus is unable to sustain life, and Cox argued her health and future fertility would be at risk if she gave birth.

“The exception requires a doctor to decide whether Ms. Cox’s difficulties pose such risks. Dr. [Damla] Karsan asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires,” the ruling states.

The court ruled Monday Cox’s doctor did not “attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”

Additionally, the ruling stated “both the discretion and the responsibility to exercise their reasonable medical judgment” falls to physicians and not judges, “given the unique facts and circumstances of each patient.”

But Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the Texas Supreme Court to intervene, arguing the lower court abused their discretion by imposing a temporary restraining order on the state ban. The Supreme Court temporarily halted that order while they weighed whether to intervene.

However, in the court’s opinion Monday, the trial court ruled a “prospective abortion would ‘fall within the medical exception’ to Texas’s abortion laws'” and “issued an order restraining the Attorney General from enforcing the abortion laws against Dr. Karsan and others related to the case.”

Cox’s case garnered national attention as Texas’ abortion ban faces its first major test of whether it applies to women facing pregnancy complications like Cox’s. The state Supreme Court is also deliberating a separate case called Zurawski v. Texas, in which 20 women are suing for clarified language in the state abortion ban that defines when a doctor may intervene to protect a mother’s life.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” President of the Center for Reproductive Rights Nancy Northup said. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer… Kate’s case has shown the world that abortion bans are dangerous for pregnant people, and exceptions don’t work. She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family. While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”

“The trial court’s order represents an expansion of the statutory exceptions to Texas’s abortion prohibitions. Because the life of an unborn child is at stake, this Court should require a faithful application of Texas statutes prior to determining that an abortion is permitted,” the Attorney General’s Office wrote in the petition to the state Supreme Court.

Attorney General Paxton argues that Cox’s life is not in imminent danger, and the state ban does not contain an exception for unborn children with fatal conditions who are unlikely to survive long after birth.

The Center for Reproductive Rights is not disclosing where Cox traveled to seek care. It is not clear whether she has already received the abortion."
Dec 11 2023,Texas Woman Who Sued for Emergency Abortion Flees State to Get Care,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/kate-cox-flees-texas-abortion-ken-paxton-1234924534,"Kate Cox, the Texas mother who sought permission to obtain an abortion, has been forced to flee the state to get medical care, her lawyers said on Monday.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents Cox. “She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.”

Cox, who lives in the Dallas area, was 20 weeks pregnant with her third child when the baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18, a fatal condition. Her baby will not survive, and her doctors advised Cox that with her medical history — including two previous C-sections — continuing the pregnancy could risk her life or her ability to have children in the future.

Last week, Cox petitioned for, and was granted, a temporary restraining order that would have allowed her to obtain an abortion under the ban’s narrow exceptions.

But immediately after Judge Maya Guerra Gamble issued her ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dispatched letters to the three Houston-area hospitals where Cox’s doctor has admitting privileges, threatening to prosecute “anyone” who aided Cox. On Friday, the Texas Supreme Court issued an administrative stay, blocking Cox from obtaining an abortion.

On Monday, her legal team notified the court that Cox had fled the state. “Due to the ongoing deterioration of Ms. Cox’s health condition, and in light of the administrative stay entered by the Court on December 8 and the Attorney General’s ongoing threats to enforce Texas’s abortion bans against the Plaintiffs in this case, Ms. Cox is now forced to seek medical care outside of Texas,” lawyer Molly Duane wrote.

Cox’s legal team, Duane added, intends to proceed with its case challenging the ban.

Northrup said in a statement Monday that Cox’s case proved one thing: “Exceptions don’t work.”

“She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family. While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence,” she said."
Dec 11 2023,Whitmer repeals abortion insurance law she fought against a decade ago,Detroit Free Press,left,https://freep.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/11/whitmer-michigan-abortion-insurance-law-reproductive-health/71854159007,"LANSING — Exactly 10 years ago, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shared for the first time publicly her own experience surviving sexual assault in hopes that it might dissuade Republicans from supporting a proposal requiring the purchase of a special insurance rider to cover abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest.

It didn't work. Every GOP lawmaker supported the legislation from the abortion rights opposition group Right to Life of Michigan. But on Monday amid the backdrop of a political landscape in Michigan transformed by Democratic control of the Legislature, Whitmer repealed the Michigan law.

The governor recalled the outpouring of support she received a decade ago after she shared she was raped, a story that didn't stop the new restriction on abortion access but she said marked a turning point in her fight on the issue. ""I knew then, this fight was not over,"" she said in remarks Monday on the Senate floor at the Capitol, where she signed the final bill in a legislative package aimed at eliminating barriers to abortion.

With Whitmer's signature on House Bill 4949, Michigan has a new Reproductive Health Act that follows the successful 2022 ballot measure to enshrine the right to reproductive freedom in the state constitution after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark abortion rights case. Combined with other abortion-related laws she signed last month, the bill Whitmer signed Monday removes several abortion-related restrictions in place in Michigan, including the one Whitmer railed against 10 years ago.

As Senate Minority Leader in 2013, Whitmer stared down the initiative from Right to Life of Michigan that obtained enough voter signatures to come before lawmakers for consideration after then-Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed similar legislation. Abortion rights opponents circumvented Snyder's veto by using the initiative process, which only requires legislative approval. Michigan stands out nationally in allowing lawmakers to enact voter-initiated legislation without the approval of the governor or a majority of voters in a statewide election.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

On the Senate floor in 2013, Whitmer delivered an emotional speech explaining her opposition to the voter-initiated legislation.

""This tells women that were raped and became pregnant that they should have thought ahead and bought special insurance for it. By moving forward on this initiative, Senate Republicans want to essentially require Michigan women to plan ahead and financially invest in health care coverage for potentially having their bodies violated and assaulted,"" she said.

She went on to share her story of being raped as a freshman in college.

""Over 20 years ago, I was a victim of rape, and thank God, it didn't result in a pregnancy, because I can't imagine going through what I went through and then having to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnancy from an attacker,"" she said. ""If this were law then and I had become pregnant, I would not be able to have coverage because of this. How extreme? How extreme does this measure need to be?""

She is not the only Democratic lawmaker to share their own sexual assault experience as part of their fight to protect abortion rights. State Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, D-Livonia — who sponsored the House Bill 4949 signed by Whitmer — delivered a speech during her first term recounting a pregnancy scare after she was raped. Thinking back to that moment Monday, Pohutsky said, ""I long for a day, when female elected officials do not have to open up their wounds on the chamber floor, to appeal to the humanity of our colleagues.""

Whitmer reflected on her own experience sharing her story, calling it one of the most ""depressing days"" earlier this year to an audience gathered in Detroit for an International Women's Forum conference. ""I didn't change a single vote,"" she said. The decision to share her personal story was last-minute and impromptu she said. ""I've got two little girls at home and I'm going to fight,"" she remembers thinking at the time. She called her own parent after delivering the speech, ringing up her father before he learned about it in news stories.

While Whitmer didn't achieve the outcome she sought that day, the speech catapulted her onto the national stage.

In 2022, with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to make abortion rights the purview of individual states, Whitmer again found herself in the middle of another big fight over the issue. She took legal action to prevent a 1931 law criminalizing abortion from going into effect before voters took action themselves, passing Proposal 3 to add an explicit right to abortion in the Michigan Constitution.

But Whitmer and abortion rights advocates said that job wasn't done, urging the passage of a Reproductive Health Act.

Michigan Laws:Whitmer signs institutional desecration bills, others

As Whitmer rallied support around the effort this fall, she heard from those with firsthand experience with Michigan's abortion restrictions. During a roundtable discussion hosted by Whitmer in a Birmingham coffee shop, abortion rights advocate and mother Clare Molnar told participants she had two abortions, one of which stemmed from a fetal abnormality that complicated the pregnancy and was ultimately covered by her insurance she said because of a technicality.

""If it hadn't been, it was a $36,000 bill,"" she said. ""That's an insane amount of money for anyone, including someone like me with relative financial privilege.""

Last month, Whitmer repealed some abortion restrictions, including regulations for clinics that abortion rights advocates characterize as onerous and a state law banning higher education institutions' pregnant and parenting services offices from providing referrals for abortion services.

In addition to eliminating the requirement to purchase an insurance rider to cover abortions, the bill Whitmer signed Monday repeals other laws, including one requiring the state health department to prioritize funding for family planning services to entities that don't provide abortion care.

While Whitmer earlier called on lawmakers to repeal Michigan's 24-hour waiting period for those seeking abortions and a ban on Medicaid funding for the procedure, Democrats didn't have enough votes to do so.

Sep 26 2023,Anti-abortion groups demand liberal Wisconsin prosecutors charge abortion providers despite ruling,Todays Chronic,left,https://todayschronic.com/anti-abortion-groups-demand-liberal-wisconsin-prosecutors-charge-abortion-providers-despite-ruling,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A coalition of anti-abortion organizations on Tuesday demanded that prosecutors in Wisconsin’s two largest counties bring charges against abortion providers who have resumed practicing following a court ruling that consensual abortions are legal in the state.

Wisconsin Right to Life, Wisconsin Family Action and Pro-Life Wisconsin held a news conference in the state Capitol to call for Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne and Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm to prosecute abortion providers in their counties.

Ozanne and Chisholm, both Democrats, announced last year that they would permit abortions in their counties despite a 174-year-old state law that conservatives argue bans the procedure. Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled this summer that consensual abortions are legal.

Galvanized by the ruling, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin last week resumed abortions at clinics in Madison and Milwaukee after ceasing procedures last year following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision giving states the power to regulate abortion. The organization plans to resume services at its abortion clinic in Sheboygan as well, although there’s no firm date reopening date yet.

Leaders of the anti-abortion groups argued at the news conference that Schlipper’s ruling isn’t final. They said the state law barring abortions remains in effect and Ozanne and Chisholm have a duty to enforce it because babies are dying.

“If district attorneys Ozanne and Chisholm do their job and ensure prosecution of abortionists in their counties is enforced, we will save lives,” said Heather Weininger, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life.

Ozanne said in an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday that his position hasn’t changed. Chisholm didn’t immediately respond to a message, but he almost certainly won’t backtrack on an issue so fundamental to Democrats as abortion rights.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin’s legal advocacy director, Michelle Velasquez, said that the organization follows the law and Wisconsin’s statutes aren’t applicable to abortion care.

“There is nothing to enforce,” Velasquez said in a statement.

Wisconsin legislators passed a law in 1849 that conservatives argue bans abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court’s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision essentially legalized abortion nationwide and nullified state abortion bans, including Wisconsin’s.

But Wisconsin legislators never erased the 1849 ban from state law. Conservatives contend that the Supreme Court’s decision in June 2022 to reverse Roe v. Wade and return the power to regulate abortions to the states effectively reactivated the prohibition.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin reacted to the Supreme Court ruling by ending abortions at its clinics in Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan, leaving women seeking such procedures to travel to other states. Ozanne and Chisholm said they wouldn’t enforce the prohibition in their counties, but Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, said he would indeed prosecute providers.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued all three prosecutors last summer, seeking a ruling that the 1849 ban was too old to enforce. Schlipper ruled this past July that the statutes prohibit killing a fetus while assaulting the mother but do not ban consensual medical abortions.

Schlipper didn’t block the ban from being enforced and has yet to issue a final order spelling out her position, leaving the door open for confusion and interpretation on behalf of anti-abortion groups and abortion-rights advocates. The case will likely end up before the state Supreme Court.

Nov 11 2023,Judge blocks red state 'abortion trafficking' ban,WND,right,https://wnd.com/2023/11/judge-blocks-red-state-abortion-trafficking-ban,"Alexa Schwerha

Daily Caller News Foundation

A judge decided to block Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” ban Wednesday, arguing that it would restrict a doctor’s right to free speech “under the guise of parental rights,” according to the ruling.

Republican Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed the law, House Bill 242, in April, which banned any adult from hiding an abortion from “parents or guardian of a pregnant, unemancipated minor” or attempting to get “an abortion-inducing drug for the pregnant minor to use for an abortion by recruiting, harboring, or transporting the pregnant minor within this state,” according to the text. Pro-abortion advocates filed a lawsuit in July, and U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham agreed with several of the plaintiffs’ concerns about chilling a doctor’s freedom of expression, according to the ruling.

“The state can, and Idaho does, criminalize certain conduct occurring in its own borders such as abortion, kidnapping and human trafficking,” Grasham wrote. “What the state cannot do is craft a statute muzzling the speech and expressive activities of a particular viewpoint with which the state disagrees under the guise of parental rights, as Idaho Code Section 18-623 does here.”

Abortion is completely banned in the state following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 with a limited exception if a doctor determines it is necessary to save the life of the mother, according to the law. The state took the law further by stopping doctors from recommending patients go to other states for an abortion and also prohibiting minors from being “trafficked” to another state for an abortion.

Republican state Rep. Barbara Ehardt of Idaho Falls, who authored the legislation, argued that it would prevent human traffickers from being able to take minors out of state without parental consent to get an abortion, according to the Idaho Capital Sun. Grasham said, however, that the state had threatened to prosecute physicians who help patients obtain an abortion in another state and therefore “established an injury in fact that is sufficiently concrete, particular, and imminent,” according to the ruling.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: Shortly after Hamas terrorists fired over 5,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel on Oct. 7 and then proceeded to attack the Jewish state by land, sea and air – torturing, burning, beheading and murdering well over a thousand people, including women, children and infants, and wounding and abducting hundreds more – world reaction was, in its own way, almost equally shocking.

For after the biggest one-day mass slaughter of Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, what followed was an outpouring of celebratory demonstrations, unbridled Jew-hatred, deliriously gleeful support for Hamas and bitter condemnation of the nation of Israel. Not just in the Arab-Muslim world, but throughout the Western world as well, including all across America.

Why? What is behind the explosion of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish, pro-terror sentiment in the United States, where Israel has long been one of America's closest friends and allies? Why are hordes of young ""woke"" LGBT demonstrators marching in support of Hamas – when Hamas wouldn't think twice about binding and blindfolding them and throwing them off the roof of a tall building – as they routinely do in the Muslim world?

It turns out there's one area of agreement that is so powerful, deep-seated and all-consuming that the vast differences between the deranged left and the murderous jihadists melt away into Kumbaya harmony.

All of this and much more is completely exposed in November's issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled ISRAEL VS. GLOBAL JIHAD: How Jew-hatred, radical Islam and Leftism are pushing us toward World War III. Beyond a deeply insightful dive into why leftists are surging toward radical Islam – which hates and dreams of raping and butchering them – this Whistleblower issue includes fantastic articles by everyone from top Israeli analyst (and former Israel Defense Forces officer) Caroline Glick to Harvest Christian Fellowship's Pastor Greg Laurie on the current war in Israel and biblical prophecies regarding the End Times … which he says are now upon us.

A woman serving five years in prison for setting fire to Wyoming’s only full-service abortion clinic last year was ordered by a judge Tuesday to pay nearly $300,000 in damages.

Lorna Green, the 22-year-old whose act of arson caused severe damage to Wellspring Health Access in Casper as it was preparing to open, must pay some $240,000 to the clinic’s insurance company, about $33,000 to the owner of the clinic building and about $24,500 to the clinic’s president, U.S. District Court Judge Alan Johnson ruled.

The payment totals the full restitution requested by prosecutors.

Green’s lawyer told The Associated Press on Wednesday that his client “looks forward to a productive and peaceful life after her term of incarceration.”

In July, Green pleaded guilty to breaking into Wellspring Health Access, pouring gasoline around the building and setting it ablaze in May of last year, just weeks before the clinic was supposed to open and start providing surgical and medication abortions.

The arson delayed the opening of the clinic by nearly a year, severely limiting Wyoming patients’ reproductive health options in the meantime. The one other abortion provider in the state ― 250 miles away, in Jackson ― only provides medication abortion, which is not an option later in pregnancy.

“While I deeply regret my actions, I accept complete responsibility for what I have done,” Green said while submitting her guilty plea.

She told investigators that her opposition to abortion, as well as anxiety and nightmares about the clinic’s opening ― a huge point of contention in deep-red Wyoming at the time ― led her to buy supplies and torch the clinic. She was captured on camera carrying out the attack, but it took investigators nearly a year to identify her.

A strict abortion ban has been passed and enacted in Wyoming, but it’s currently on hold due to a court injunction."
Nov 22 2023,Virginia Democrats already pushing abortion-on-demand amendment,American Thinker,right,https://americanthinker.com/blog/2023/11/virginia_democrats_already_pushing_abortionondemand_amendment.html,"If anybody has any doubt about abortionists’ priorities — or Democrats’ dedication to them — one need only read Virginia House Joint Resolution 1.

Having taken control of the Virginia House of Delegates and kept control of its Senate, Virginia Democrats signaled their commitment to abortion by prefiling in symbolic first place a bill to write abortion on demand into the Old Dominion’s state constitution.

The proposed amendment guarantees abortion on demand for any reason throughout pregnancy. Unlike Ohio’s recently adopted Issue One, it does not even feign the pretense of a post-viability limit on abortion. Instead, any restriction by Virginia would be subject to a test that identifies a “compelling state interest” and is the “least restrictive means” to achieve that interest.

Clearly, under this amendment, the state has no interest in the life of the unborn. In that sense, it’s even more radical than Roe v. Wade, which paid lip service to the state’s “interest” in “potential life” (though, in practice, the Court never found any instance in which that “interest” stood in the way of an abortion).

What is clearly behind this language (and its references to “accepted clinical standards” and “evidence-based medicine”) is the exclusion of any sort of legislation attendant to abortion that might conceivably discourage a woman from having one. From 2012 through 2020, for example, Virginia required women to be shown an ultrasound of their unborn child and had a 24-hour waiting period prior to obtaining an abortion. Ultrasound imagery did cause some women to change their minds.

When Democrats took control of the Legislature in 2020, they immediately repealed those requirements, which abortionists pejoratively brand as “TRAP” (Targeted Restrictions on Abortion Providers) laws. Given the absolute commitment of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to abortion on demand without restrictions, litigants will always be able to find ACOG “clinical standards” argument to nullify the least restriction on abortion.

If, as H.J. Res. 1 states, “every individual has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom,” the amendment will also preclude any possibility in Virginia of a parental consent or notification law with regard to a minor daughter. That language is a backdoor slap at the parental rights movement in the state, thanks to which Republicans in 2021 won the governorship and lower house of the General Assembly. While those wins were attributable to resistance to gender ideology in public schools, the stealth language of the proposed amendment bars parental consent or notification laws on abortion without explicitly coming out and admitting that.

Speaking of stealth language, the very phraseology of the amendment imports gender ideology into the state constitution without admitting it. No “women” get pregnant under H.J. Res. 1: only “individuals” do. The use of that term and the indefinite adjective “one” is clearly intended to disconnect sex (as opposed to gender) from pregnancy.

The second paragraph of the proposed amendment will undoubtedly be used as a major talking point: “the Commonwealth shall not penalize, prosecute, or otherwise take adverse action against an individual [or “an individual who aids or assists another individual” regarding] “such individual’s pregnancy.” Like the slapdash HB1786 rammed through Pennsylvania’s lower house November 15, just 22 days after its introduction, abortionists want to create hysteria about pro-life states supposedly champing at the bit to prosecute women and abortionists.

The truth is that a close reading of HB1786 shows that the bill actually gives immunity to abortionists who commit abortions in states where they are illegal at that gestational age and/or botch their provision of “reproductive health care services” but manage to get back to Pennsylvania, which will render them immune from account for their malpractice. What’s operative here is not real care for women’s (or children’s) health, but furthering the mantra that “abortion is health care.”

As with similar abortion on demand amendments being pushed in other states, the ambiguities of the text are deliberate, left that way so that — under the guiding standard that there be no interference with “the fundamental right to reproductive freedom” — courts in the future will swat down any restrictions abortionists don’t like. The almost fifty years of Roe’s jurisprudence makes that trajectory clear.

Consider, for example, the amendment’s stipulation that “effectuat[ing] one’s own decisions about all matters related to one’s pregnancy shall not be ... burdened.” That language can, and likely will, lead state courts to say Virginia must pay for abortions under Medicaid and Obamacare state health exchanges, something the state currently does not do. Of course, by writing such requirements into a constitutional amendment, Virginia Democrats want to straitjacket the question: not only would such taxpayer subsidy of abortion not be a policy question, but it could never be answered any other way except “yes.”

Under Virginia’s system, a state constitutional amendment must pass each house by a simple majority, a state election (in 2025) intervene, the amendment be adopted a second time, and then sent to the voters in referendum within 90 days of final passage. Democrats are hoping to ride the abortion issue to state control by keeping the Legislature and flipping the governorship in 2025, when term-limited Glenn Youngkin must leave. Already, pro-abortion Democrat Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger has announced her candidacy, likely to play the “suburban soccer mom” image who wants to ensure that Virginia remains at least “the only pro-choice Southern state.”

No one should be surprised at the expedited pace with which the new Richmond majority dropped this bill. Campaigning on H.J. Res. 1 is a political design to turn Virginia blue...and red, with the blood of its unborn.

Dec 09 2023,TX Supreme Court Blocks Order Allowing Woman’s Abortion at 20 Weeks,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/12/09/texas-supreme-court-blocks-order-allowing-womans-abortion-20-weeks,"The Texas Supreme Court on Friday night halted a lower court ruling that allowed a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant to have her unborn baby aborted.

The state’s high court blocked a temporary restraining order from Democrat Travis County District Judge Maya Fuerra Gamble after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the court to intervene. The Texas Supreme Court blocked the order “without regard to the merits” of the case.

The case involves Kate Cox, 31, a mother of two from the Dallas area. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed a lawsuit on her behalf to obtain an abortion after she learned that her unborn baby has Trisomy 18, otherwise known as Edwards syndrome. The original complaint states that the condition means “her pregnancy may not survive to birth, and if it does, her baby would be stillborn or survive for only minutes, hours, or days.”

The complaint also states that Cox had been to three different emergency rooms within a month due to “severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.” The lawsuit alleges that her history of having two prior cesarean surgeries means continuing the pregnancy “puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

The complaint argues that it is Dr. Damla Karsan’s (Cox’s healthcare provider) “good faith belief and medical recommendation” that Cox’s circumstances “fall within the medical exception to Texas’s abortion bans and laws.” In Texas, abortion is outlawed except to save the life of the pregnant woman or prevent serious risk to her physical health, and a doctor can be prosecuted for performing the procedure. The lawsuit ultimately asked the court to block the state from enforcing its abortion laws to allow Karsan to abort Cox’s unborn baby.

Before the Texas Supreme Court blocked the lower court ruling, Paxton issued a statement saying that the temporary restraining order “will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws.”

He said:

This includes first degree felony prosecutions, Tex. Health & Safety Code § 170A.004, and civil penalties of not less than $100,000 for each violation, Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 170A.005, 171.207-211. And, while the TRO purports to temporarily enjoin actions brought by the OAG and TMB against Dr. Karsan and her staff, it does not enjoin actions brought by private citizens. Tex. Health & Safety Code § ¬¬171.207. Nor does it prohibit a district or county attorney from enforcing Texas’ pre-Roe abortion laws against Dr. Karsan or anyone else. The TRO will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires.

Paxton also wrote a letter before the state Supreme Court’s order to the hospitals where the doctor involved in the case had admitting privileges. In the letter, he argued that Dr. Karsan has “failed to follow your hospital’s procedures for determining whether Ms. Cox qualifies for the medical exception to Texas’ abortion laws.”

To read the letter, see below. pic.twitter.com/tCZMSDGqMB — Texas Attorney General (@TXAG) December 7, 2023

“It appears she has not sought a second opinion from a colleague at your hospital to determine whether they agree with her that Ms. Cox qualifies for the medical exception. Nothing in the TRO (temporary restraining order) compels you to waive your hospital’s long-standing policies for determining whether a patient, including Ms. Cox, qualifies for the medical exception to Texas’ abortion laws,” the letter reads.

He added:

…[T]he TRO and the allegations in this lawsuit, on their faces fail to establish that Ms. Cox qualifies for the medical exception to Texas’ abortion laws. To fall within the medical exception, the physician must determine “in the exercise of reasonable medical judgement, the pregnant female on whom the abortion is performed, inducted, or attempted has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.”

Paxton also argued that Karsan’s “good faith” belief is “not the legal standard” for allowing an abortion — “reasonable medical judgment and life-threatening physical condition are.”

He continued:

The TRO is further deficient because it failed to identify what ‘life-threatening’ medical condition that Ms. Cox purportedly has that is aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy, nor does it state with specificity how this unidentified condition places Ms. Cox at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced. The temporary ruling fails to show that Dr. Karsan meets all of the elements necessary to fall within an exception to Texas’ abortion laws. Judge Guerra Gamble is not medically qualified to make this determination and it should not be relied upon. A TRO is no substitute for medical judgment.

The lawsuit “could become a test case for similar cases elsewhere,” The Washington Post noted.

“On Friday, a pregnant woman sued Kentucky, arguing that the state’s near-total abortion ban violates the right to privacy and self-determination in the state constitution,” according to the report. “Cox and the Kentucky woman are the first two adult women to seek permission from a judge for an abortion since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.”

Cox’s lawsuit is separate from another broader case, Zurawski v. Texas, brought by five women who had been pregnant and sued the state over its abortion laws. Those women are claiming the state’s laws denied them proper health care and put their lives in danger.

“Four of the women traveled out of state to have abortions; the fifth, whose fetus did not have a chance of surviving, was allowed to deliver only after she became septic, leaving her with permanent physical damage,” according to the Washington Post report. “The case now involves 20 women, and the Texas state Supreme Court held a hearing on the matter last week.”

The case is Cox v. Texas, No. 23-994 in the Supreme Court of Texas."
Nov 21 2023,Whitmer signs bills deregulating some aspects of abortion in Michigan,Detroit News,center,https://detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/21/michigan-abortion-laws-clinic-regulations-mifepristone-medicine-gretchen-whitmer/71660830007,"Livonia — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday signed into law a series of bills that aim to codify abortion rights into Michigan law and repeal measures that abortion advocates say inhibit access to the medical procedure of terminating a pregnancy.

The Reproductive Health Act would put the language of the Reproductive Freedom For All constitutional amendment, Proposal 3 of 2022, in state law and make a variety of additional repeals and changes to existing Michigan abortion law.

Whitmer signed eight of the nine bills in the package Tuesday, but delayed signing the main piece of legislation that codifies the language of the Reproductive Freedom for All constitutional amendment and repeals several current regulations. It's not clear why the governor delayed that bill, but the legislation she signed Tuesday is dependent upon it's enactment because of tie-bars in the bills.

The bills she did sign largely repeal requirements for abortion clinics to be licensed as freestanding surgical centers in Michigan, so-called ""TRAP laws"" that opponents said put unnecessary and onerous building code requirements on abortion clinics. TRAP is an acronym for targeted restrictions on abortion providers.

""These are politically motivated, medically unnecessary restrictions on hallway width, ceiling height, HVAC system and janitors' closets,"" Whitmer said. ""... These have nothing to do with providing the necessary health care. All these restrictions do is increase costs, especially for independent clinics, and decrease the number of (abortion) providers that are available to Michiganders.""

Supporters of the licensing rules have long argued the surgical center standards protected the health and safety of the woman seeking an abortion.

When Whitmer signs the main bill in the package at some point in the future, she'll be enacting a bill that codifies the language of the November 2022 constitution amendment, repeals the state's partial birth abortion act in the penal code and voids a 92-year-old law that criminalizes the abortion of a ""quick child"" or a child that has started moving in the womb. The bill also nixes laws that require insurance providers to make customers pay for an additional rider for abortion coverage.

Proposal 3 passed with support from 57% of voters in November 2022, enshrining a right to abortion in the state constitution after a U.S. Supreme Court opinion earlier that year overturned a nearly 50-year-old opinion that secured abortion rights at the federal level. Sponsors of the Reproductive Health Act said their bills simply implemented Proposal 3 in state law.

But the bills ultimately passed by the Legislature fell short of the initial sweeping changes the Reproductive Health Act aimed to make, in large part due to opposition in the House. The final legislation that will be signed by Whitmer next week does not include Medicaid funding for abortions, did not repeal mandatory screening for coercion and did not repeal of the state's 24-hour waiting period ahead of an abortion, as was initially intended by sponsors.

The omission of those measures prompted abortion rights supporters including the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan and Planned Parenthood of Michigan to call the final package a ""watered-down"" version of the Reproductive Health Act that ""lacks key policy reforms.""

Right to Life of Michigan called Tuesday's bill signing a ""dark day"" for Michigan and argued the laws would present an ""immediate danger"" to the safety and health of women and children. The failure of lawmakers to repeal the 24-hour waiting period, parental consent laws and bans on Medicaid funding were a ""silver lining,"" the anti-abortion group said.

""The shocking elimination of the ban on partial-birth abortion demonstrates what many voters have hesitated to accept — pro-abortion Democrats will accept no limit on abortion, not even at the time of birth,"" said Barbara Listing, president for Right to Life of Michigan.

The bills Whitmer signed Tuesday repealed a partial birth abortion ban in the public health code, but not in the penal code. The remaining bill waiting to be signed will repeal the ban in the penal code. A ban on partial birth abortions remains in federal law.

The overall package would codify the year-old constitutional language on reproductive rights in state law and would repeal current penalties and criminal references related to administering a partial birth abortion, ""quick child"" abortion and certain abortion insurance requirements. Additionally, it nixes certain building code standards required of a freestanding surgical center, repeals guidelines for fetal remains disposal and repeals bans on providing abortion information through pregnant and parenting student programs at public universities.

The provisions related to the Medicaid funding of abortion and the 24-hour waiting period were removed from the package after Rep. Karen Whitsett, D-Detroit, said she didn't support the measures and would vote no on the package while they remained part of it.

When the items were removed, the package moved through the House in 56-54 votes along party lines.

""I do not think it is too much to ask when someone's terminating a life, a 24-hour pause to be able to say for sure this is the decision you want to make. Twenty-four hours is not too much,"" Whitsett said previously.

Whitmer was joined at Tuesday's bill signing ceremony at Schoolcraft College by several female lawmakers, including House Speaker Pro Tem Laurie Pohutsky, a Livonia Democrat.

In calling the 24-hour waiting period to have an abortion ""arbitrary and punitive,"" Pohutsky took a veiled shot at Whitsett in her remarks.

""One person's personal politics can still, unfortunately, greatly impact what we were able to do,"" Pohutsky said.

The repeal of the 24-hour waiting period was one that Whitmer supported publicly in August and was a measure abortion groups said was integral to abortion access.

""Without eliminating the Medicaid abortion ban and the 24-hour mandated delay, access to abortion care will remain out of reach for too many across our state,"" a statement from abortion advocacy groups earlier this month said. ""Barriers like these make abortion care more difficult to access and often have a disproportionate impact on Black and brown people, people working to make ends meet, rural residents, and other marginalized communities.""

Medicaid is the federal-state health plan for mostly low-income residents.

The Democratic governor said she would hold a separate bill-signing ceremony for the main bill in the package, House Bill 4949. The bill, among other things, repeals a requirement that women purchase an additional rider on their health insurance to cover elective abortions. Republicans passed the legislation a decade ago when Whitmer was the minority leader in the state Senate.

""Stay tuned for that repeal,"" Whitmer said. ""It's on deck.""

Nov 30 2023,"DeSantis vs Newsom face off on abortion, transgenderism, wokeness and more",Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/sean-hannity-ron-desantis-gavin-newsom-debate,"Democrats have chance of swapping out Biden for someone new in 2024, but time is ticking

Calls are growing for Democrats to find an alternative to President Biden before the next election. With the first primary contests a few months away, is it too late for them to find a viable replacement?

The short answer is no, but time is running out.

Biden would either need to face a serious primary challenge now or decide to step down later. Either method would make history in the modern era.

Pathway 1: The Democratic primary

Democrats already have a process in place to find a new candidate for the general election. That is the presidential primary. Democrat voters will head to the polls from January to June next year and select a presidential nominee.

Biden already faces competition from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Marianne Williamson for that nomination, but polling shows that Democrat voters are not enthusiastic about them. The most likely candidate is California Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Rumors are also swirling around the popular governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Pathway 2: The Democratic National Convention

While Biden will appear on the primary ballot and is by far the most likely candidate to win the nomination, he can decide to step down from the race at any point.

The ideal time to complete that process would be during the Democratic National Convention in August. If Biden wins a majority of delegates but wants to step down, he could use a speech prior to the convention or even during the week to endorse another candidate.

Under Democratic Party rules, pledged delegates are not required to vote for the candidate they represent but are told to ""reflect the sentiments of those who elected them,"" so an endorsement from Biden would be very influential.

If there are multiple candidates, but a majority voted in line with Biden’s wishes, that candidate would become the Democrats’ presidential nominee. This would be a variation on what is usually called a contested convention.

If Biden fails to convince a majority in this hypothetical, and no candidate wins the first ballot at the convention, a brokered convention would take place. Delegates are released from their pledges, so leading figures in the nominating process, like party leaders and congresspeople, would try to persuade delegates to support their preferred candidate instead."

A judge has ordered a woman who set fire to Wyoming’s only full-service abortion clinic to pay nearly $300,000 in restitution, the full amount sought by prosecutors.

Lorna Green is serving five years in prison for burning Wellspring Health Access weeks before the clinic was set to open in Casper in 2022. The fire gutted the building while it was being renovated for the new clinic and delayed its opening by almost a year.

After opening this past April, Wellspring is now the only abortion clinic in Wyoming. A clinic in Jackson that provided pill abortions closed Dec. 15 due to rising costs.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson ordered Green, 22, to pay about $298,000 in restitution including $240,000 to Nationwide General Insurance Company, the clinic’s insurer.

Green must also pay $33,500 to the building’s owner, Christine Lichtenfels, and $24,500 to Julie Burkhart, founder and president of Wellspring Health Access. Burkhart expressed satisfaction with the restitution.

“Not only did we have the emotional struggle and that trauma from the arson but also it was quite challenging for us financially. So I’m glad this is the final piece and it has been put to rest,” Burkhart said Wednesday.

The restitution was identical to the amounts sought by prosecutors and unopposed by Green’s attorney, Ryan Semerad, who in an emailed statement said Wednesday that Green “looks forward to a productive and peaceful life after her term of incarceration.”

Green has expressed remorse for the crime, which she said was driven by anxiety and nightmares about the planned clinic. The Casper College mechanical engineering student had shown no sign of anti-abortion views on social media but told investigators she opposed abortion.

She admitted driving from Laramie to Casper, breaking into the clinic through a door and lighting gasoline she poured in trays and splashed on the floor. After months of little progress, investigators increased the reward to $15,000 and got tips leading to Green’s arrest in March.

Green pleaded guilty in June to arson and in September received the minimum prison sentence. She had faced up to 20 years in prison.

The arson and eventual opening of the clinic happened as new laws in Wyoming seek to ban abortion in nearly all cases. The laws, including the nation’s first explicit ban on abortion pills, have been put on hold by a judge amid a lawsuit filed by four women and two nonprofits including Wellspring Health Access.

After hearing arguments in the lawsuit Dec. 14, Wyoming District Judge Melissa Owens is weighing whether to rule on the laws. Her decision would likely be appealed, putting Wyoming’s abortion laws before the state Supreme Court."

Dec 08 2023,"Planned Parenthood, ACLU sue Kentucky over near-total abortion ban",WCPO 9,center,https://wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/planned-parenthood-aclu-sue-kentucky-over-near-total-abortion-ban,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky's near-total abortion ban and fetal heartbeat bill are the target of a new lawsuit filed in Kentucky Circuit Court Friday.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky and Planned Parenthood Kentucky announced their filing months after their initial attempt to overturn Kentucky's restrictive abortion bans failed before the state's Supreme Court.

The new 52-page class action lawsuit on behalf of an anonymous Kentuckian said the bans were causing an eight-week pregnant woman and those like her irreparable harm ""by forcibly imposing the physical burdens and health risks of continued pregnancy and childbirth.""

ACLU Kentucky Executive Director Amber Duke joined Planned Parenthood's Rebecca Gibron at a Friday afternoon press conference.

""We are here to represent a Kentucky woman,"" Duke said.

Duke said the new lawsuit would succeed where the last one failed because a woman, going under the pseudonym Jane Doe, came forward to claim harm to herself where the previous lawsuit relied on a health care provider suing on behalf of clients.

Duke quoted the woman at the press conference about her desire to have an abortion.

""This is my decision, not the government's or any other person's,"" she said.

Gibron said the lawsuit was necessary to protect potentially thousands of Kentuckians who aren't able to seek medical care.

""Access to reproductive health care has been denied for far too long — 494 days,"" she said.

Anti-abortion proponents like Addia Wuchner, Kentucky Right to Life's executive director, said they were keeping an eye on the latest legal developments.

""We're reviewing this case,"" Wuchner said.

She said Kentucky Right to Life would continue to fight for abortion bans in a post-Roe V. Wade world where each battle looks different from state to state.

""Everyone is fighting this battle, and it's not as easy as we thought it was going to be in the states,"" Wuchner said. ""It's not a slam dunk and we just win.""

David Walls with The Family Foundation said he believes the Kentucky Supreme Court will reject the ACLU's latest legal filing, and the voters would continue to hold control over abortion policy in Kentucky.

""We have got to move on from this mindset and recognize that every election at the federal level, at the state level, at the local level, the abortion issue is going to be front and center,"" Walls said.

ACLU representatives said they were confident in their case, and, since the filing was a class action lawsuit, urged pregnant women who wanted to be a part of the lawsuit to call them or Planned Parenthood.

As it is named in the lawsuit, WCPO reached out to Attorney General Daniel Cameron's office.

A spokesman issued this statement: “The Attorney General’s office is reviewing the complaint.”"

Dec 08 2023,Missouri lawmakers propose allowing homicide charges for women who have abortions,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/news/nation/abortion-homicide-Missouri-legislation-u85604,"JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. — Some Missouri lawmakers are renewing a call for the state to take an anti-abortion step that goes further than prominent anti-abortion groups want to go and that has not gained much traction in any state so far: a law that would allow homicide charges against women who obtain abortions.

Republicans in both the state House and Senate have introduced bills to be considered in the legislative session that begins next month to apply homicide laws on behalf of a victim who is an “unborn child at every stage of development.”

The bills would offer exceptions if the suspect is a woman who aborts a pregnancy after being coerced or threatened, or an abortion is provided by a physician to save the life of the pregnant woman.

“To me, it’s just about protecting a baby’s life like we do every other person’s life,” state Rep. Bob Titus, a first-term Republican who is sponsoring one of the measures, told The Associated Press. “The prosecution is just a consequence of taking an innocent human life.”

Titus said no charges would need to be brought under the bill, so long as people abide by the law already on the books that makes Missouri one of 14 states with bans in effect on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions.

Titus said he has not discussed his bill with legislative leaders and did not base it on any model legislation, though it is aligned with a bill by Republican state Sen. Mike Moon, who represents the same area in southwestern Missouri.

Two groups are trying to get measures on ballots in Missouri in 2024 to legalize abortion in more cases. One would bar the government from infringing on abortion rights during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. The other, being crafted by moderate Republicans, would scale back restrictions to a lesser degree.

Abortion-related measures could be before voters in several states next year. Since last year, voters have sided with abortion rights in all seven states where the questions have been on the ballot.

The abortion landscape in the U.S. has been shifting quickly since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling and ended a nationwide right to abortion.

Most Republican-controlled states have adopted bans or restrictions and most Democrat-run states have taken steps to protect access.

Prominent anti-abortion groups have generally opposed measures that would subject women who get abortions to charges.

Still, identical legislation was introduced earlier this year in Missouri and similar bills were introduced in 2023 in other states including Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky and South Carolina. None was advanced by a legislative committee.

The Kentucky measure died after it was opposed by the state's Republican attorney general and legislative leaders. At the time, GOP House Speaker David Osborne said the Republican majority in his chamber had never contemplated passing an abortion ban without any exceptions.

In South Carolina, more than 20 GOP lawmakers signed on as sponsors of a bill that would have classified abortion as homicide. As the bill garnered attention, several lawmakers withdrew their support. Lawmakers later adopted a ban on abortions when cardiac activity can be detected, generally around six weeks into a pregnancy – and often before women realize they are pregnant."

Nov 08 2023,Republicans can’t sugarcoat their losses on abortion rights anymore,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs,"Even before Tuesday’s elections, many progressives insisted the question of whether protecting abortion rights wins elections was already asked and answered. Democrats made abortion rights the centerpiece of their campaign advertising during the 2022 midterms, a cycle where Democrats outperformed expectations, kept control of the US Senate, and staved off a red wave. Polls last year also found abortion rights to be a significantly motivating issue for both independent and Democratic voters.

Abortion rights ballot measures won in all six states where they appeared in 2022, including states like Montana, Kentucky, and Kansas that otherwise elected Republican candidates. Democrats have been winning in special elections where they ran on abortion rights, and surveys suggested voters have grown even more supportive of abortion rights since the repeal of Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Anti-abortion groups argued in turn that liberals were mistaking correlation for causation; they maintained that confidence in abortion rights messaging was misplaced, and voters would ultimately punish Democrats for their maximalist positions. They pointed out that Democrats tried and failed to unseat anti-abortion governors in the midterms, and applauded winning federal candidates who “went on offense” on abortion, like Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. The lost referendums, anti-abortion groups insisted, stemmed largely from Republican leaders failing to campaign hard enough and from being outspent, something they promised to never let happen again.

The polling on abortion rights, meanwhile, could be complicated and seem contradictory: Voters sometimes express support for second- and third-trimester bans while signaling strong opposition to restricting access to abortion.

The 2023 election cycle represented a big test: Were abortion rights activists right? Or were anti-abortion leaders correct that the earlier post-Roe losses stemmed from insufficient investment and mealy-mouthed campaigning?

A decisive 13-point victory for protecting abortion rights in red Ohio, wins for Democrats in the Virginia legislature where GOP candidates campaigned on rolling back abortion access to 15 weeks, and the decisive reelection of Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who made protecting abortion rights in his red state central to his campaign, provide the clearest evidence to date that voters of all political persuasions do not support the nationwide attack on reproductive freedom and are voting accordingly.

Anti-abortion leaders tested a host of new tactics this cycle — from rebranding abortion bans as “limits” to claiming the Ohio abortion rights ballot measure was really about curtailing parents’ rights. None of them worked. Republican strategists had been banking on November 7 providing them with proof that voters were sick of Democrats talking about abortion. Virginia was supposed to be a proof of concept that would let Republicans run on a “consensus” position on 15-week bans next year while changing the subject to other topics like crime and immigration.

So Tuesday’s results really were a resounding victory for Democrats and abortion rights supporters — but there are still some caveats and reasons for caution in 2024.

How abortion rights won in Ohio

Anti-abortion leaders recognized how important a win in Ohio would be to changing the narrative ahead of 2024. “A win here would show those other states that will have these ballot measures in the years to come, ‘Hey, these battles can be won,’” Peter Range, the executive director of Ohio Right to Life, told the 19th News in October. The anti-abortion movement threw everything they had at the campaign and still fell far short.

Instead, last night 57 percent of Ohio voters cast their ballot in favor of the constitutional amendment to codify abortion access, despite a significant array of obstacles in a solidly Republican state where Republican elected officials had come out uniformly against the measure.

“Generally speaking, ballot measures in Ohio don’t tend to win,” said Jonathan Robinson, the director of research at Catalist, a liberal voter data analytics firm.

Passing affirmative ballot measures is even harder. In the other conservative states where ballot measures won, abortion rights campaigners organized voters against anti-abortion proposals. Political scientists find it can be easier to be on the “no” side of ballot measure campaigns, since voters have a bias toward maintaining the status quo.

“The reality is Ohio is among the tougher states that we have worked in,” said Joey Teitelbaum, a pollster involved with the Ohio abortion rights campaign, who also worked on winning ballot measures in Colorado, Kansas, and Kentucky. “We stayed focused on a broad values-based message that went beyond partisan politics.”

Though polls indicated Ohio voters were broadly supportive of the proposed amendment, abortion rights advocates were dealing with new hurdles, including an expensive August special election that sought to raise the ballot measure threshold to 60 percent, voter roll purges led by the anti-abortion secretary of state, a misleading intervention from the state’s Republican attorney, and vocal campaigning from the state’s Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who urged Ohioans to vote no in a TV ad.

The Ohio Ballot Board also drafted its own summary language of the proposed ballot measure, using more politically objectionable terms like “unborn child” instead of “fetus” and refusing to state that the amendment would protect not just access to abortion but also to contraception, miscarriage care, fertility treatment, and continuing pregnancy. Researchers know that the specific language that appears on a ballot can have a significant impact on how voters vote, and a poll released in late October found support for the amendment dropped considerably when voters were presented with the edited language.

“I have never encountered such complete opposition by the state government,” said Ashley All, who served as communications director for the winning pro-abortion rights ballot measure campaign in Kansas and has since consulted on other post-Roe ballot referendums.

Anti-abortion advocates raised millions more dollars than they had in previous ballot measure campaigns, and worked to cast the Ohio amendment as an “anti-parent” measure that would effectively create a new right to gender-affirming surgery for minors. Legal scholars said the fear-mongering about parental consent was unjustified, given Ohio case law and the Republican-controlled state Supreme Court.​

That abortion rights won so decisively against all these odds — and that so many Trump voters proved willing to cross party lines to vote in favor of the amendment — is a sobering result that anti-abortion leaders will struggle to dismiss. For now, the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America group is saying it lost because voters incorrectly believed pregnant patients could be denied life-saving medical care. But even in states with exceptions to abortion bans, doctors have been denying or delaying care, fearing funding cuts or criminal prosecution.

How abortion rights won in Virginia

Though Virginians were not casting votes on a ballot measure, it was no secret that the Virginia legislative elections were largely being fought over abortion.

“It almost feels like we’re running a single-issue campaign on this one,” J. Miles Coleman, of the UVA Center for Politics, said last week. Among women voters, who make up more than half of Virginia’s election, 70 percent rated abortion as a “very important” issue, up 47 percent from 2019.

All 140 seats in the Virginia General Assembly were up for grabs, and Democrats not only retained control of the state Senate but flipped control of the Virginia House.

Youngkin and anti-abortion groups bet that if they could win in Virginia by running emphatically on a 15-week abortion ban, something they cast as a “reasonable” and “consensus” position, then they could prove to Republicans nationwide that abortion need not be a political loser for their party. (The ban, which they called a “limit,” also would have exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.) They also hoped that staking out this position would allow them to more easily change the subject to topics they had advantages on, like crime and the economy.

Prior to the fall of Roe, national polls showed broad support for restricting abortion after 15 weeks, but since the Dobbs decision, voters have been signaling more opposition to the idea. A poll released in mid-October from Christopher Newport University found 54 percent of Virginians opposed the idea of a 15-week ban, and another October survey from the Washington Post-Schar School found 47 percent opposed and 46 percent approved.

Another way to understand the question in Virginia is whether voters would support lawmakers cutting short the window of legal abortion by 12 weeks, since abortion is currently permitted up to 26 weeks and 6 days of a pregnancy in the state.

Voters, though, had good reason to be suspicious Virginia Republicans really would stop at 15 weeks. In Florida, Republicans passed a 15-week ban on abortion in 2022, only to turn around and pass a six-week ban in 2023. Other GOP-led states like South Carolina, Georgia, and Ohio have passed six-week bans.

Multiple videos also emerged of Virginia Republicans admitting they’d likely push for more than they’ve publicly let on. In 2021, an activist secretly recorded Youngkin saying he’d go “on offense” if elected but needed to speak minimally about the topic during campaign season. Two months ago videos surfaced of a House of Delegates candidate saying he’d support a “100 percent” and “total” ban on abortion, and more recently a video of a candidate in a Virginia Senate race showed her saying she’d be interested in pushing beyond a 15-week ban.

A Washington Post-Schar School poll from October found that 51 percent of registered Virginia voters trusted Democrats to handle abortion, compared to 34 percent who trust Republicans.

There are real grounds for abortion rights optimism in 2024

The news out of Ohio is auspicious for those organizing abortion rights ballot measures next year in Arizona, Nevada, Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Colorado. Abortion rights have had a 7-0 winning streak on the ballot since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and Republicans’ fear-mongering rhetoric about parents’ rights and abortion “up until birth” seemed to have failed. While Americans tend to be more uncomfortable with abortions later in pregnancy, voters seem to understand they are extremely rare, and typically associated with fetal anomalies, threats to a mother’s life, and barriers to care that delay access to the procedure.

Evidence continues to mount that voters are willing to cross party lines when it comes to protecting access to reproductive health care. If abortion rights campaigners can continue to frame the issue in a nonpartisan way, their odds of success in the next round of ballot measures look good. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s strong reelection in Kentucky is also an encouraging signal that Democrats can campaign openly on abortion rights in red states and still win.

It’s hard to overstate how much the loss in Virginia complicates’ Republicans’ 2024 campaign plans. Virginia was supposed to show that Republicans could cast Democrats as extremists, proactively pursue reductions in abortion access, and still win, even among Biden-leaning voters. The GOP wanted to show Republicans could “neutralize” the abortion issue, so that swing voters would feel more comfortable voting on other topics they trusted Republicans on. Youngkin insisted voters are “ready to move on and talk about topics besides abortion.”

The fact that Republicans failed so spectacularly doesn’t mean Republicans won’t try this strategy again next year, but it does represent a rather clarifying result — and one that should make GOP strategists pretty nervous, especially given that most voters think Republicans want to ban abortion in all or most cases.

How things could still go poorly for abortion rights in 2024

While things have gone well for abortion rights campaigners thus far, most will admit they were certainly not sure things would play out as they did. And, as anti-abortion leaders are quick to point out, Democrats tried and failed to unseat anti-abortion governors like Brian Kemp in Georgia, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Mike DeWine in Ohio, and Ron DeSantis in Florida last year, showing that it’s not dispositive that politicians will pay a price for restricting access to abortion.

“In the midterms, yes, abortion mattered in certain places, and democracy issues mattered on certain races. But not all of them,” Ashley All told Vox. “Florida voted exactly as Florida does. Political observers and pundits want to make blanket statements about how things will impact an election, but everyone who works on campaigns knows it doesn’t work like that.”

Another concern is that Youngkin’s prediction was just premature and that voters will in fact grow more tired of hearing about attacks on abortion rights the further out from Dobbs the country gets. Republicans bet wrongly on that happening in 2022 and 2023, but experts admit it’s hard to know what will be animating voters a year from now, especially given how exhausted the electorate seems to be these days.

“Generally people seem a little burnt out,” said Robinson, of Catalist. “The level of political donations for Democrats and Republicans is down a lot, which suggests a sag in interest in politics. Interest in the Republican presidential primary is really low.” Though turnout on November 7 was high, the abortion rights measure in Ohio received nearly as many votes as Republican Sen. J.D. Vance did in 2022.

Reproductive rights campaigners also say the public should not underestimate how tough a fight they faced this year in Ohio compared to the previous six ballot measure campaigns in 2022. Anti-abortion politicians are likely to continue their efforts to curb access to the ballot, and invest heavily in TV and digital advertising aimed at confusing voters. This year abortion rights activists benefited from Ohio being the only ballot measure campaign in the country, helping them to raise three times as much money as their opponents, with most money coming from out of state.

Next year, when there are more expensive ballot measures competing for both media attention and political donations, on top of a surely consuming presidential contest and a bevy of congressional and gubernatorial elections, advocates say the fundraising landscape for abortion rights referendums may be much more difficult."

Wade was overturned, and Republicans’ fear-mongering rhetoric about parents’ rights and abortion “up until birth” seemed to have failed. While Americans tend to be more uncomfortable with abortions later in pregnancy, voters seem to understand they are extremely rare, and typically associated with fetal anomalies, threats to a mother’s life, and barriers to care that delay access to the procedure.

Evidence continues to mount that voters are willing to cross party lines when it comes to protecting access to reproductive health care. If abortion rights campaigners can continue to frame the issue in a nonpartisan way, their odds of success in the next round of ballot measures look good. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s strong reelection in Kentucky is also an encouraging signal that Democrats can campaign openly on abortion rights in red states and still win.

It’s hard to overstate how much the loss in Virginia complicates’ Republicans’ 2024 campaign plans. Virginia was supposed to show that Republicans could cast Democrats as extremists, proactively pursue reductions in abortion access, and still win, even among Biden-leaning voters. The GOP wanted to show Republicans could “neutralize” the abortion issue, so that swing voters would feel more comfortable voting on other topics they trusted Republicans on. Youngkin insisted voters are “ready to move on and talk about topics besides abortion.”

The fact that Republicans failed so spectacularly doesn’t mean Republicans won’t try this strategy again next year, but it does represent a rather clarifying result — and one that should make GOP strategists pretty nervous, especially given that most voters think Republicans want to ban abortion in all or most cases.

How things could still go poorly for abortion rights in 2024

While things have gone well for abortion rights campaigners thus far, most will admit they were certainly not sure things would play out as they did. And, as anti-abortion leaders are quick to point out, Democrats tried and failed to unseat anti-abortion governors like Brian Kemp in Georgia, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Mike DeWine in Ohio, and Ron DeSantis in Florida last year, showing that it’s not dispositive that politicians will pay a price for restricting access to abortion.

“In the midterms, yes, abortion mattered in certain places, and democracy issues mattered on certain races. But not all of them,” Ashley All told Vox. “Florida voted exactly as Florida does. Political observers and pundits want to make blanket statements about how things will impact an election, but everyone who works on campaigns knows it doesn’t work like that.”

Another concern is that Youngkin’s prediction was just premature and that voters will in fact grow more tired of hearing about attacks on abortion rights the further out from Dobbs the country gets. Republicans bet wrongly on that happening in 2022 and 2023, but experts admit it’s hard to know what will be animating voters a year from now, especially given how exhausted the electorate seems to be these days.

“Generally people seem a little burnt out,” said Robinson, of Catalist. “The level of political donations for Democrats and Republicans is down a lot, which suggests a sag in interest in politics. Interest in the Republican presidential primary is really low.” Though turnout on November 7 was high, the abortion rights measure in Ohio received nearly as many votes as Republican Sen. J.D. Vance did in 2022.

Reproductive rights campaigners also say the public should not underestimate how tough a fight they faced this year in Ohio compared to the previous six ballot measure campaigns in 2022. Anti-abortion politicians are likely to continue their efforts to curb access to the ballot, and invest heavily in TV and digital advertising aimed at confusing voters. This year abortion rights activists benefited from Ohio being the only ballot measure campaign in the country, helping them to raise three times as much money as their opponents, with most money coming from out of state.

Next year, when there are more expensive ballot measures competing for both media attention and political donations, on top of a surely consuming presidential contest and a bevy of congressional and gubernatorial elections, advocates say the fundraising landscape for abortion rights referendums may be much more difficult."

Nov 08 2023,Abortion Activists Triumph In Nov. 7 Elections In Conservative States,Black Enterprise,left,https://blackenterprise.com/abortion-activists-triumph-in-nov-7-elections-in-conservative-states,"Women by Stacy Jackson Abortion Activists In Conservative States Triumph In Nov. 7 Elections Abortion activists in Ohio, Kentucky and Virginia triumph after taking a firm stance to protect rights to the procedure in Nov. 7 elections.









Abortion rights activists made their position on an issue that has been one of nationwide contention loud and clear in Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky on Nov. 7 with election victories.

A passed amendment protecting abortion in Ohio and a strong Democratic presence in Virginia and Kentucky could mean that demand from abortion activists across the nation continue over a year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, The Washington Post noted.

Activists turned out for Kentucky’s gubernatorial election and re-elected incumbent Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear over Republican nominee and former Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, according to USA Today. Beshear’s re-election to a second term could signal good news for abortion activists in the state where Republicans presently dominate. Beshear went after his Republican opponent’s support of an almost-complete ban on abortion where exceptions for the procedure would only be made for rape and incest, The Washington Post reported.

The Democrat said in a victory speech on Nov. 7 that Kentucky will be a better place because of people like Hadley Duvall, a young woman who shared how her stepfather sexually assaulted her in a viral campaign ad for Beshear.

“Because of her courage, this commonwealth is going to be a better place, and people are going to reach out for the help they need.”

Similarly, Virginia is on track to put Democrats in power, as the party is projected to gain control of the state legislature, The Washington Post reported. Schuyler VanValkenburg—a Democrat—snagged a Republican-held seat in Richmond. VanValkenburg took a stance that abortion rights should be protected. Republicans in the state presented a 15-week abortion ban, arguing that most procedures would still happen as opposed to an all-out ban. Nonetheless, Democrats were projected to flip the House of Delegates and hold a narrow majority in the Senate.

In Ohio, abortion activists triumphed with the passing of an amendment that guarantees access to abortion. A Republican, Kate Wagner, shared her reasoning for siding with her Democratic counterparts on the matter of protecting abortion rights.

Wagner said, “My whole thing is that I don’t like the idea of typically old white men telling me what I should be able to do.” The outlet showed in a figure that Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati were among the cities where activists were most in favor of abortion rights."

Nov 08 2023,Abortion Access is Now Officially Enshrined in Ohio's Constitution,Vogue,left,https://vogue.com/article/abortion-access-ohio-constitution,"It’s been over a year since the overturning of Roe v. Wade made the process of getting an abortion in the US significantly more complex, but as of Tuesday, there is some rare good news on the reproductive-autonomy front; Ohio voters just approved a constitutional amendment that ensures access to abortion and other forms of reproductive care.

Historically, Ohio hasn’t been the most reliable state for abortion rights—it is, after all, the birthplace of the six-week “heartbeat bill” that was signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in 2019—but now, the nation’s seventh most populous state is joining Michigan, California, and Vermont in preventing the restriction of abortion access before fetal viability (traditionally interpreted to be around 22-24 weeks of pregnancy).

“This win marks a new beginning for Ohio, where individuals now have the right to make reproductive decisions without government overreach,” Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio executive director Lauren Blauvelt said on Wednesday. Ballot measures protecting the right to abortion have been successful in six states since 2022, but seeing one pass in a bellwether state like Ohio (with double the amount of signatures it needed in the first place) is a hopeful sign that the role of abortion could be less fraught in the upcoming election year than it has been since the fall of Roe."
Nov 29 2023,Arkansas attorney general rejects 'misleading' abortion ballot measure wording,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/arkansas-ag-rejects-misleading-abortion-ballot-measure,"

Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin has rejected the wording for the title of an abortion ballot measure aimed at expanding access to the procedure in the state.

Griffin, a Republican, called some of the wording “tinged with partisan coloring and misleading” because the proposal “is solely related to abortion, not ‘reproductive healthcare’ generally.”

BIDEN SKIPS CLIMATE CONFERENCE AS HIS GREEN AGENDA IS CRITICIZED AT HOME

The opinion comes as supporters of legal abortion have found success in multiple states with ballot initiatives aimed at reversing legislative restrictions on abortion since the overturn of Roe v. Wade.

“Deception is the common theme in every abortion ballot measure. Abortion activists have repeatedly used unclear language to mislead voters into embedding unlimited abortion in their state constitutions,” Kelsey Pritchard, SBA Pro-Life America state public affairs director, said in a statement. “Because Americans do not support second- and third-trimester abortions, Big Abortion must funnel millions into ads that lie about what these amendments actually do in order to be successful.”

Arkansans for Limited Government submitted a proposed amendment to the state constitution on Nov. 9, calling it the “Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment,” the title in question in the legal dispute alongside other phrases throughout the text of the proposal.

The amendment, as written, would prohibit the state government from “restrict[ing] access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception, or in cases of rape, incest, in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant female’s life or health.”

Current Arkansas law prohibits abortion except in instances to save the life of the mother.

Griffin’s authority to certify wording for ballot measures does not take into account the merits of the proposals’ content, but his seven-page rejection pointed to numerous instances of potentially “misleading” wording that would need to be resolved before moving onto the process of collecting signatures to gain ballot access.

“Is your intent to limit government action regarding abortion itself or regarding access to abortion?” he stated. “The ballot title would need to describe the nature of the restriction you intend to propose. Because of this lack of clarity, I am unable to say that your ballot title is not misleading.”

Griffin also drew a distinction between a pregnant woman’s physical and mental “health,” a difference cited by many who do not support abortion access because the distinction could permit late-term abortions by way of mental health diagnoses.

The ballot committee said it “appreciate[d] the attorney general’s thorough review of and impartial response to the amendment’s language,” according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, and added it would “begin work immediately with the amendment drafter to craft a revised amendment.”

Dec 07 2023,Travis county judge grants Texas woman abortion due to medical conditions,KWTX 10,center,https://kwtx.com/2023/12/08/travis-county-judge-grants-texas-woman-abortion-due-medical-conditions,"WACO, Texas (KWTX) - Texas 459th District Court Judge Maya Gamble approved a temporary restraining order against the State of Texas so that Kate Cox, a Dallas-area woman, could get an abortion because of medical issues.

Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, last week learned her fetus would have a fatal health condition, Trisomy 18, and her doctors recommended she terminate her pregnancy.

Abortions are no longer allowed in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and Cox was unsure of what to do next.

Molly Duane, with the Center of Reproductive Rights, represented Cox in an emergency lawsuit seeking to restrain the State of Texas and the Texas Medical Board from intervening with her physician recommended abortion.

Duane says what is happening here in Texas is not unique, and people should understand how difficult the situation is for pregnant women who cannot carry to full term.

“What is happening in Texas right now is a human rights violation. And I ask you to think about all the people who need abortions right now for reasons that are their wholly own who cannot drop everything to file a lawsuit it is absurd.”

While Cox, Duane and her team view this verdict as a win, Amy O’Donnell with the Texas Alliance for Life says that abortion will be difficult for the fetus this late into the pregnancy.

“A late term abortion will be violent and cruel for the baby and will in no way eliminate the sense of loss for the parents.”

O’Donnell believes this case will be a gateway to making all abortions legal again in Texas.

“The Center for Reproductive Rights, who is behind this Cox v. Texas and the Zurawski v. Texas case, is seeking to chisel away at our Texas pro-life laws so that abortion is available on demand up to birth,” O’Donnell said.

Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement, that the temporary restraining order will “expire long before the statute of limitations of violating Texas’ abortion law expires.”

But Marc Hearron, one of Cox’s lawyer and senior council for the Center of Reproductive Rights, believes that the government should not intervene with a physician’s diagnosis.

“Doctors need to be able to practice medicine, they need to be able to exercise their medical judgment to determine what is the best healthcare for their patient and not have the attorney general second guessing medical decisions. These are decisions for doctors to make not lawyers in Austin or politicians in Austin.”

Cox’s temporary restraining order will expire on December 21st at 5:00 pm.

Nov 07 2023,Ohio voters enshrine abortion rights in state constitution,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ohio-voters-enshrine-abortion-rights-state-constitution-fall-roe-v-wad-rcna122077,"Ohio voters have added the right to access abortion care to the state's constitution, NBC News projects — another major political victory for abortion-rights advocates in the nearly 17 months since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.

The passage of the Issue 1 ballot measure inserts language in the state constitution guaranteeing every person in Ohio the right “to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion,” and barring the state from “burdening, penalizing or prohibiting” those rights — though it specifies that abortion will remain prohibited after the point a doctor judges a fetus would most likely survive birth, with exceptions to protect the woman’s life or health.

Approval of the ballot measure marks yet another victory for abortion-rights advocates, this time in a state that Donald Trump twice carried by 8-point margins. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the national right to abortion access in its June 2022 Dobbs decision, ballot measures backing abortion rights have won in every election so far, even in conservative states, including Kentucky and Kansas — and in an August special election in Ohio that served as a proxy battle ahead of November’s constitutional amendment fight.

Tuesday’s outcome further demonstrates that abortion could remain a major liability for Republicans in elections. As in Ohio, polling has shown that voters across the country broadly favor abortion protections — a fact that Democrats leveraged last year to keep control of the U.S. Senate, fend off a red wave in the House and win several governorships. Next year, it is likely to be central to President Joe Biden's campaign for re-election.

In Ohio, passage of the amendment will effectively counteract the state's “heartbeat bill,” which took effect immediately after the Dobbs decision and banned most abortions — with exceptions for the health of the pregnant woman and ectopic pregnancies — but remains temporarily blocked by a state judge.

That case is before the state Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in September.

Groups on both sides of the abortion fight spent millions in the run-up to an August election in Ohio — another ballot measure campaign, that one over whether to make it harder to amend the state constitution in the future, including raising the threshold for success to 60% instead of a simple majority. It lost in August. Its resounding defeat was a clear win for reproductive rights advocates in Ohio, and in many ways it paved the way for the success of the measure approved Tuesday.

Following that campaign, reproductive rights groups began far outspending anti-abortion groups in the fight over the November measure.

Since Aug. 9, groups supporting the November Issue 1 measure spent $23.7 million on advertising, compared to $10.7 million the anti-abortion groups spent against the amendment, according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending."

The case is believed to be among the first attempts in the nation to seek a court-approved abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year and allowed states to enact their own abortion restrictions.

The judge, Maya Guerra Gamble of Travis County district court, sided with the woman, Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, and issued a temporary restraining order to permit her doctor to perform an abortion without facing civil or criminal penalties.

The judge, a Democrat, agreed with Ms. Cox’s lawyers that the procedure was necessary to protect Ms. Cox from a potentially dangerous birth, and to preserve her future fertility."

ARKANSAS ABORTION MONUMENT APPROVED BY STATE HOUSE, MUST BE APPROVED BY GOV. SANDERS

ARKANSAS GOVERNOR SIGNS LEGISLATION BANNING ALMOST ALL ABORTIONS

Arkansas’ current law bans abortions except to save the mother's life in a medical emergency. The law took effect when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade last year.

Since the court overturned the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed abortion rights advocates. Advocates on both sides in at least a dozen states are trying to get abortion-related measures on the 2024 ballot.

Griffin rejected the wording in a letter dated Tuesday, citing ""ambiguities"" in the text of the proposal. The Republican also said the proposal was ""tinged with partisan coloring and misleading"" and said it needs to describe the impact it will have on existing law.

""Since the Arkansas Supreme Court has declared that voters are entitled to some information on how the proposed measure would change current law, some such information would need to be provided,"" Griffin wrote.

The ballot committee said in a written statement to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that it learned of Griffin's decision Tuesday.

""We appreciate the Attorney General’s thorough review of and impartial response to the amendment’s language,"" according to the committee chaired by Dr. Hershey Garner.

""Residents want sensible reproductive policy, and Arkansans for Limited Government will begin work immediately with the amendment drafter to craft a revised amendment,"" the group said. ""We are committed to supporting a ballot proposal that is clear for Arkansas voters.""

Had Griffin certified the proposal's popular name and ballot title, the ballot committee could begin collecting signatures of registered voters in an effort to qualify the proposed constitutional amendment for the 2024 general election.

Sponsors of proposed constitutional amendments are required to submit 90,704 registered voters' signatures to the secretary of state’s office by July 5, 2024. The total must include signatures from registered voters in at least 50 of the state's 75 counties, according to the secretary of state’s office."

Ohio voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that will codify abortion rights in the state constitution, according to the New York Times. Issue 1—which will also enshrine the right to make decisions about birth control, miscarriage care, and fertility treatment—passed by a vote of 58% to 42%, with about 40% of the ballots in. An NBC News exit poll found that 60% of Ohio voters were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The victory came despite Republicans waging an all-out misinformation campaign on the amendment by claiming it would do things like strip parental rights and allow rapists to force survivors to have abortions.

The pro-choice position has now won in all seven states that have put abortion on the ballot since the fall of Roe, with Ohio becoming the first “affirmative” abortion victory in a Republican-leaning state. (Previous pro-choice wins in red states like Kansas and Kentucky came via voters rejecting anti-abortion measures with a “no” vote. Affirmative abortion votes have come in the heavily Democratic states of California, Michigan, and Vermont.) In 2020, Donald Trump won 53% of the vote in Ohio to Joe Biden’s 45%.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) told reporters before the race was called that Ohioans are pro-choice. Manu Raju tweeted that Brown told him: “Ohio has a 6-week ban. The Republicans have done all they can to obscure that, to make it sound like ‘we should be doing something reasonable, let the legislators do what they want.’ Voters reject that.”

Conservatives and activists desperately wanted to break their losing streak on statewide abortion votes, but Ohio lawmakers’ zeal to try to thwart the ballot measure may have come back to bite them. Buckeye state Republicans tried everything to stop Issue 1, including authorizing an August special election on whether to raise the threshold that ballot measures need to pass from 50% to 60%. That effort failed by a stunning 14 points, and it cost the anti-abortion side a lot of time, money, and goodwill with voters. (A little more than 3 million voters turned out in August for that proxy vote on abortion.)

Gov. Mike DeWine (R) stayed out of the August election, but appeared in a lecturing ad claiming that Issue 1 is “just not right for Ohio.” DeWine obscured the fact that the ballot measure would be the deciding factor in whether a six-week abortion ban he signed in 2019 would snap back into effect, and he made other absurd claims about what would happen if people voted for it. DeWine won re-election last year by 25 points, but it appears people don’t care to listen to him when it comes to bodily autonomy.

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), who is running to be the Republican nominee for Senate in 2024, also got involved. He ordered the purge of nearly 27,000 inactive voters in late September but didn’t announce the move as his office has done in the past. LaRose also drafted an amendment summary that appears at the top of the ballot that replaced the word “fetus” with “unborn child.” The state Supreme Court—where Gov. DeWine’s son Patrick serves as a justice—upheld the changes, and yet the amendment still passed.

In recent weeks, pro-choice supporters did begin to worry when two major newspapers made unexpected moves: The editorial board of Cleveland.com refused to take a side—instead allowing board members to write short essays on their stance—while the board at the Toledo Blade came out against Issue 1. But it appears those actions didn’t matter.

Ohioans have been waiting to hear if the state Supreme Court will uphold the currently blocked six-week abortion ban, but now that Issue 1 passed and the right to choose an abortion will go in the state constitution, the ban has no legal legs to stand on.

National groups seized on the Ohio election as a potential turning point. David Bereit, an anti-abortion activist who founded the group 40 Days for Life said during a webcast in late October that groups like his were banking a lot on the results. “This is not just Ohio’s struggle. For all of us, this is a national tipping point moment,” he said, per Politico. “The outcome here can and will dictate the trajectory for the entire United States, whether it’s to bolster or to thwart the abortion agenda from coast to coast.” That trajectory is now decidedly pro-abortion.

Advocates in states including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska, and Nevada are already working to get abortion measures on their ballots for 2024."

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be a parent and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said at the conclusion of Thursday’s emergency hearing.

The state is likely to petition a higher court to overturn Guerra Gamble’s order. Attorney General Ken Paxton responded to the decision Thursday afternoon with a statement that said the order does not protect Cox’s medical team from civil lawsuits or the enforcement of pre-Roe abortion laws by district or county attorneys.

Cox, 31, knew something was wrong with her third pregnancy when she experienced severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks that sent her to three different emergency rooms. After testing, doctors diagnosed her baby with full trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, meaning the baby is unlikely to survive long after birth if it’s not stillborn.

“An abortion was not something I ever imagined I would want or need; I just never thought I’d be in the situation I’m in right now. Twenty weeks pregnant with a baby that won’t survive and could jeopardize my health and a future pregnancy,” Cox wrote in a firsthand account published Wednesday on Dallasnews.com. “I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas.”

Since the case was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights on Tuesday, Cox visited an emergency room for the fourth time for similar symptoms. The lawsuit alleges that Cox is at risk for severe complications that could threaten her life or fertility given her two prior cesarean sections and elevated vital signs.

Under Texas’ abortion bans, pregnant people are only able to obtain an abortion if they have “life-threatening physical condition” or are at risk of “substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” It’s an issue at heart of the Zurawski v. State of Texas lawsuit filed by the center that includes 20 women who say their abortions were delayed or denied because the exemptions are unclear.

“Now a patient must be about to die before a doctor can rely on the exception,” said the center’s attorney Molly Duane. “This position is not only cruel and dangerous, but it flies in the face of the Texas Constitution, medical ethics and the laws themselves.”

Under the order, obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Damla Karsan will be allowed to perform Cox’s abortion. Karsan is also a plaintiff in the Zurawski case on behalf of herself as a doctor and on behalf of her patients.

Paxton sent a letter to three hospitals in Houston where Karsan reportedly holds privileges to warn them that they could be found civilly or criminally liable if the doctor performs Cox’s abortion. He asserted that Karsan failed to follow the hospital’s procedures for determining whether Cox meets the standards for a medical exemption to the abortion laws.

“Your hospital may be liable for negligently credentialing the physician and failing to exercise appropriate professional judgment, among other potential regulatory and civil violations, if you permit Dr. Karsan to perform an unlawful abortion,” Paxton said in the letter.

Paxton’s response could have a chilling effect on future lawsuits similar to Cox’s, said Seema Mohapatra, health law expert and professor at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law.

“These letters that they have here shows you what kind of power the state is trying to exert,” Mohapatra said. “I mean, this is pretty threatening language.”

Before the fall of Roe, the state Legislature passed Senate Bill 8, known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans abortion after six weeks gestation and is enforced through civil lawsuits from private individuals. SB8 has largely not been scrutinized in court, Mohapatra said, but an abortion performed on Cox has the potential to serve as a test case.

“This is getting a lot of high-profile attention. This could be the first one,” Mohapatra said of Cox’s case. “The problem is that any of these cases could be a potential first case.”

During the hearing, the state took issue with both the type of request made by the reproductive rights center and the assertion that Cox qualifies for an abortion under current state laws.

Jonathan Stone, an attorney representing the state, argued that a temporary restraining order wasn’t the proper course of action because an abortion is permanent.

“The plaintiffs are going to obtain permanent relief in this case through this TRO application without any evidence being considered by this court and a full-blown evidentiary hearing,” Stone said.

The state also argued the temporary restraining order would change the status quo by allowing an abortion that “would otherwise not be permissible pursuant to the medical exemption.”

The state consulted Dr. Ingrid Skop to review the case. Stone said Skop, a San Antonio obstetrician and gynecologist who also served as an expert witness for the state in the Zurawski case, didn’t think the pleadings sufficiently met the criteria for a medical exemption.

Duane said it’s unclear what the state considers to be elements needed to qualify for a medical exemption.

“I read the statute, Dr. Karsan reads the statute to say that a serious risk of substantial impairment of Ms. Cox’s reproductive functions would fall within the medical exemption,” Duane said. “If that is not what the statute means, then the state after two years of silence really ought to tell us.”

Just over a week ago, Duane and the state argued in front of the Texas Supreme Court over the Zurawski lawsuit, which requests a temporary injunction that would exempt any Texan with a medically complicated pregnancy from the state’s bans, including those with fatal fetal diagnoses.

Travis County Judge Jessica Mangrum previously ruled in favor of the injunction, but Paxton’s office appealed the decision to the state’s highest court.

The state argued that the women suing don’t have standing to seek clarity on the bans because any decision would help them only in hypothetical scenarios, like if they were to get pregnant in the future.

“Then the court would be saying that a patient needs to have blood or amniotic fluid dripping down their leg before they can come to court,” Duane said at the hearing.

It could be months before the state Supreme Court issues a ruling in the Zurawski case."
Dec 07 2023,Texas judge approves abortion for woman with endangered fetus despite state’s ban,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-lawsuit-case-ruling,"A Texas woman whose 20-week-old fetus was given a fatal diagnosis has been granted a rare restraining order against the Lone Star State’s strict abortion ban.

The ruling challenges a near-total ban passed in Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Thursday’s ruling by State Democratic District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble is expected to be challenged by the state, which asked her not to grant an exception for Kate Cox.

How soon Cox, from the Dallas area, will be able to terminate her pregnancy is unclear.

According to lawyers for the 31-year-old mother of two, Cox went to an emergency room earlier this week for a fourth time since August. Doctors have told her that if her fetus’ heart stops beating, they’d be forced to perform an emergency C-section, which wouldn’t be her first. Doing so could mean she’d never be able to carry another child.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Guerra Gamble ruled.

Cox wrote of her situation in a Dec. 6 essay for The Dallas Morning News.

“We were so excited to learn I was pregnant again in August and had so much fun springing the news on our wider family,” she wrote.

Then, according to Cox, she was informed her third baby, which would have been a girl, had Edwards syndrome. The National Institutes of Health says roughly half of all babies born with that chromosomal disorder live just more than a week and only 5-10% of children survive beyond the first year.

“An abortion was not something I ever imagined I would want or need,” Cox continued.

Cox is represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which calls the successful challenge unprecedented.

Texas joined 12 other states in passing strict anti-abortion measures after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. In August 2022, performing an unauthorized abortion became a felony in the state.

Just more than 40 abortions have been performed without consequences since the state’s enactment of the ban, which has extremely narrow exemptions. More than 16,000 women had abortions in Texas in the five months preceding the ban.

Following the ruling on Thursday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton posted notice that the temporary restraining order (TRO) granted by the judge “will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else from civil or criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws.”

“Judge Guerra Gamble is not medically qualified to make this determination and it should not be relied upon,” he wrote in a letter addressed to three hospitals at which Cox’s physician holds privileges. “A TRO is no substitute for medical judgment.”

Nov 07 2023,Voters in US state of Ohio to weigh in on abortion rights,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/7/voters-in-us-states-of-ohio-virginia-to-decide-questions-on-abortion,"Residents of Ohio are voting in statewide elections where a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution is on the ballot.

The measure could decide the future of abortion access for millions of people in the state as voters head to the polls on Tuesday. The outcome of the vote could also serve as an indication of the urgency voters will assign to abortion rights in the 2024 election.

The vote comes more than one year after the US Supreme Court threw the country’s abortion rights landscape into flux with a ruling in June 2022 that allowed states to further restrict or even ban abortion.

In the time since, many conservative states have moved to restrict the practice or ban it outright, including some bans that include no exceptions for extreme cases, such as pregnancies resulting from rape or incest.

But supporters of abortion rights have been buoyed by a number of state-level ballots in which voters have largely shown their preference for maintaining access to abortion.

In the Republican stronghold of Kansas in August 2022, voters rejected a bid to remove abortion rights from the state constitution by a margin of 59 percent to 41 percent.

Seeing those victories, alongside polling that finds abortion bans consistently unpopular, abortion rights advocates have fought to put the issue before voters wherever possible.

While Ohio’s voters will decide whether to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, supporters of abortion have pushed for similar measures to appear on the ballot in states such as Arizona and Florida.

Ohio voters rejected a separate Republican-backed referendum in August that would have raised the threshold for amending the state constitution from a simple majority of the vote to 60 percent.

Democrats have made abortion rights a central theme of recent elections, sensing an opportunity to hammer their Republican rivals over positions that are widely unpopular.

In the southern state of Virginia, where elections are also being held on Tuesday, Democrats who currently hold a majority in the State Senate have warned that a Republican victory would open the door to further restrictions on abortion.

Indeed, some Republicans have said that they want to see existing restrictions go further.

Several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, such as Senator Tim Scott and former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, have suggested that they would support a nationwide ban, with some uncertainty regarding what such a ban would look like."
Dec 07 2023,Court of appeals judges hear abortion challenge arguments based on religious freedom,IndyStar,center,https://indystar.com/story/news/health/2023/12/07/court-of-appeals-hear-abortion-challenge-based-on-religious-freedom/71826036007,"The Indiana Court of Appeals Wednesday heard oral arguments in a lawsuit over whether the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act exempts those whose faith does not hold that life begins at conception from the state's abortion ban.

The hearing is the latest in a legal battle that erupted after Indiana legislators passed a near-total ban on abortion last year. Supporters of abortion rights are fighting back against what they see as an infringement on a pregnant person's fundamental right to make a health care decision. The majority of Indiana lawmakers, however, support placing severe restrictions on abortion.

A lawyer representing a group of Hoosiers argued that the abortion ban is based on the Christian belief that life begin at conception so those of other faiths should be exempt from the near-total ban. The state's lawyer rejected that argument, comparing such an ask to taxpayers who cite religious freedom to avoid payment.

It's unclear when the judges — Lloyd Mark Bailey, Melissa S. May and Leanna K. Weissmann — will issue a decision.

Five anonymous Hoosiers holding different religious beliefs and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice first sued for abortion access last September, as the state initially instituted its near-total abortion ban that only allows for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, and life of the mother.

The judges pressed James Barta, the state's lawyer, multiple times to explain why there are exceptions for protecting life at conception when it comes to rape, incest, in vitro fertilization and life of the mother, but not for religious freedom.

""You have a Christian belief system that is different than a Jewish belief system that's different than a Muslim belief system,"" Weissmann said. ""So how can the state mandate a policy that compels compelling interest based on a Christian belief system?""

Barta said previous legal rulings have established the state has a right to protect life at conception, regardless of religion. He added that legislators had to weigh different interests when passing the abortion law, but argued that any other exceptions should be decided by lawmakers.

""Those exceptions reflect that the legislature recognizes there are some ethical and moral imperatives when you have a pregnancy that's a product of rape or incest,"" he said.

The judges also pressed the lawyer for those seeking the exception, Ken Falk, legal director of ACLU Indiana, on the burden the abortion ban puts on the rights of the people he represents.

""None of them are currently pregnant. None of them are seeking an abortion. Where does the substantial burden come in?"" Weissmann asked.

Falk said that the ban has changed their behaviors and lives. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs say they feel forced to abandon plans to have children or have an active sex life due to fears of dangerous or unwanted pregnancies.

""We're talking about one of the most fundamental burdens that one could impose on someone,"" he said. ""We can go back to how we reacted to the United States hearing that China had a one child policy. How's that possible? That's an incredible burden on the human experience. And that's exactly what these women are facing.""

The religious challenge was one of two legal efforts to reverse the ban. The first challenge, by abortion providers and the ACLU Indiana, temporarily blocked the ban by asserting the law was unconstitutional. That decision was eventually reversed earlier this year.

For Hoosiers, the question of access to abortion in Indiana has been confusing due to the legal back and forth. However, Indiana residents can travel to neighboring states, Ohio and Illinois, for abortion care.

Dec 20 2023,North Dakota judge to hear request to temporarily block part of abortion law that restricts doctors,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/news/nation/North-Dakota-Legislature-abortion-e00699,"BISMARCK, N.D. — A North Dakota judge said Wednesday he will decide soon whether to temporarily block a part of the state's revised abortion laws so doctors can perform the procedure to save a patient's life or health.

The request for a preliminary injunction asks state District Court Judge Bruce Romanick to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their “good-faith medical judgment” to perform an abortion because of pregnancy complications that could pose ""a risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.”

North Dakota outlaws all abortions, except in cases where women could face death or a “serious health risk.” People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.

Physicians, to mitigate risk of prosecution, ""feel like they must delay offering abortions to their patients until the patients' health has declined to the point where other physicians could not plausibly disagree that it was necessary to provide an abortion,” Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh said.

“Patients and physicians have experienced significant harm,” she said. “For patients, the denial of their constitutional rights and forced additional health risks; and for physicians, the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication.”

The state's revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.

Special Assistant Attorney General Dan Gaustad cited the plaintiffs' “seven-month delay” in seeking a preliminary injunction, and he disputed the “good-faith medical judgment"" language. He told the judge the plaintiffs are asking him “to modify and rewrite the statute under the guise of a preliminary injunction."" The law uses ”reasonable medical judgment.""

The Red River Women’s Clinic sued the state last year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion. The lawsuit targeted the state’s since-repealed trigger ban — a ban designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade — as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.

The judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect last year, which the state Supreme Court upheld in March.

Chief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court’s March decision that “it is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

Soon afterward, North Dakota's Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state's abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed into effect in April.

In June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine. A jury trial is scheduled for August 2024."

Nov 07 2023,Virginia’s Popular Governor Risked It All on Abortion. Oops.,Slate,left,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/11/virginia-election-abortion-glenn-youngkin-democrats-republicans.html,"When you get down to it, being the Republican governor of a blue state is a pretty good gig. With the legislature typically controlled by Democrats, your Larry Hogans and Chris Christies can spend their time tinkering with the state budget or railing against the excesses of the other side without having to worry too much about enacting a conservative agenda that would make them unpopular with the liberal-leaning people who elected them.

That could have been the path for Glenn Youngkin, the lanky, boyish governor of Virginia. Cut some deals with Democratic lawmakers, enjoy a little friendly sparring with the crew of Morning Joe, and head into retirement with a book deal, some corporate board seats, and maybe a stint at the Harvard Institute of Politics.

But Youngkin chose a riskier path, putting all his chips on new restrictions on abortion, and on Tuesday, he lost that bet. Democrats have won back control of the state House of Delegates and kept the state Senate, a resounding win that means they can not only block his attempts to limit abortion, but begin the process of putting a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access before voters—a move he can’t yet veto.

Election night dashed a plan long in the making. A former hedge fund manager who had never served in office before being elected governor, Youngkin had put on his signature red sweater-vest, barnstormed the state, and spent down his campaign war chest to boost Republican candidates for the Virginia General Assembly. His goal was to cobble together a narrow majority that would give the GOP total control of a state that Joe Biden won by more than 10 percentage points.

Advertisement

The candidates predictably focused on bread-and-butter issues like crime and education on the campaign trail and in most of their ads. But Youngkin’s focus-grouped and poll-tested Big Idea was to neutralize the issue of abortion—a losing issue for Republicans since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year—by focusing on a 15-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

If the plan had worked, Youngkin would have instantly been a national Republican hero, showing the party how to overcome its greatest weakness with suburban women voters in a key state. Already, some big-money donors nervous about Donald Trump’s chances of winning next November had been talking up Youngkin as a potential savior who could swoop into the Republican presidential primary and be offered as an alternative.

Advertisement

That was about as likely to happen as, well, Larry Hogan or Chris Christie beating Trump. But it’s definitively over now, and Youngkin’s abortion plan is a big reason. Voters keep telling Republicans they want to protect access to abortion. In 2022, they rejected anti-abortion measures in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana and backed abortion rights measures in California, Michigan, and Vermont. Earlier this year, they flipped the majority in the Wisconsin state Supreme Court over the issue. And on Tuesday, they enshrined abortion rights in the Ohio state constitution. Virginia proved no different.

Youngkin’s team, which included some heavy-hitters of the powerful Republican consulting world, thought they’d cracked the code because independent-leaning women in focus groups were more supportive of a 15-week ban than six-week bans. So they included exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother—a sticking point that has tripped up other Republican candidates. They very carefully avoided the word “ban,” preferring to call it a “limit.” And Youngkin promised that Republicans wouldn’t try to pass anything stricter than his proposal.

Advertisement

Advertisement

It didn’t work. But the whole exercise raised the question of why he tried in the first place. After all, the easiest way to neutralize the issue of abortion would have been to vow not to sign any bill. Take Hogan, the popular two-term governor of Maryland. Although he describes himself as a pro-life Catholic, he basically took a pass on the issue, saying it was “settled law,” and only vetoed a bill that would have expanded abortion access in his last year in office, as he was mulling his own presidential bid.

Advertisement

It’s possible Youngkin feels strongly on the issue, personally. I once watched him take the stage at a campaign rally to “Spirit in the Sky,” pointing upward when Norman Greenbaum sang “gotta have a friend in Jesus” with the energy of a youth pastor putting on a show at Vacation Bible School. And he once said he would sign any bill restricting abortion “happily and gleefully.” These are not the words of a man who thinks this is settled law.

Advertisement

But Youngkin also knows Republican primary voters care about abortion. If he wanted to jump into the presidential race against Trump, he’d need to establish his bona fides on the issue. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week ban in 2022 and then followed it up by signing a six-week abortion ban a year later.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Youngkin’s also running out of time. Virginia governors cannot serve consecutive terms, which means they start thinking about their next job almost as soon as they take office.* In recent years, that’s led most of them to gaze northward across the Potomac River and wonder if they have what it takes to be president. In fact, since the 1980s, every governor of Virginia except Ralph Northam and Tim Kaine has either run for president or been talked about as a potential contender. The closest any of them came was when Kaine was picked as Hillary Clinton’s running mate, which (as you may remember) did not end well.

Advertisement

Youngkin will now join that rogue’s gallery. The state once known as “the birthplace of presidents” for producing eight of them—including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Woodrow Wilson—is now more like the graveyard of presidential ambition.

But if there’s any solace for Youngkin, it’s that he remains popular there, with a 57 percent approval rating over the summer in one poll—numbers Biden can only dream about. That rating would have tanked if he’d won control of the legislature and started doing things like restricting abortion—and actually running for president would have doomed him even more in his home state. But this is the Faustian bargain of a Republican governor of a blue state, doomed to be popular only because you can’t really do what you want."

Nov 28 2023,Fight against abortion ban goes before Texas Supreme Court,CBS Austin KEYE,center,https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/fight-against-abortion-ban-goes-before-texas-supreme-court,"The argument over Texas’s strict abortion law went before the Texas Supreme Court Tuesday when justices heard oral arguments in the case.

The plaintiffs in have long said they’re not seeking to overturn the law but instead want clarification on when an abortion can be performed due to a medical exception. Nearly two dozen women argue the law left their lives in jeopardy with their doctors’ hands tied. However, attorneys for The State argue the law is already clear enough.

“I think people have no right to judge what other people are going through until they've been through that situation themselves,” said Taylor Edwards of Austin. Edwards is one of 20 women suing Texas over the state’s abortion ban. After years of IVF treatment Edwards became pregnant but later learned her child wouldn’t survive even if she made it to birth. Growing increasingly ill, Edwards traveled to Colorado for an abortion.



“I want people to understand they have no clue what they would do if they were faced with these situations that me and my fellow plaintiffs have been faced with. Until you're sitting there being told your child's not going to live you don't know. You just don’t know,” she said.

Other plaintiffs in the case suffered a premature rupture of membranes, making them more susceptible to severe infection and did not receive abortions until they were very sick and at risk for death.

Earlier this year a district judge outlined when abortions should be allowed as medical exceptions. In court Tuesday, attorneys for The State argued that district judge “overstepped constitutional bounds by rewriting and expanding the medical emergency exception,” because the law is already clear enough. The State suggested some of the women, who they agree should have gotten abortions but didn’t because their doctors were fearful of jailtime under SB 8, should be suing their doctors instead.



Lauren Miller, another plaintiff in the case, stood outside of the Texas Supreme Court with her doctor. “She is standing here alongside me. She's a fabulous doctor. She has gotten me through two pregnancies-- one of which was clearly, horribly traumatic, and she is standing here right beside me. That is a good doctor. That is not the person I should be suing here. I place the blame firmly at the feet of The State,” Miller said.

The Texas Alliance for Life pushed back saying any clarification on the law should come from the Texas Medical Board.

“We are here today because we support the pro-life laws in Texas and we believe the language is adequate to protect a mother’s life,” said Amy O'Donnell, communications director for the Texas Alliance for Life. The organization’s policy analyst, Deirdre Cooper, said she had been in the same shoes as some of the women suing the state, but she does not regret seeing her baby’s fatal trisomy 18 diagnosis to the end—even if her son did not survive.

“Abortion robs that child of the chance at life-- no matter how short. It robs the child of the chance of a miracle or the chance that the medical diagnosis is wrong,” Cooper said. “People think these are such difficult situations, but I disagree. There is nothing difficult about not killing your child-- no matter his diagnosis,” she added.

The Texas Supreme Court is expected to issue an opinion in the coming months or by June of 2024 at the latest. They could make a ruling in the case or send it back to a lower court for a closer look."

Dec 06 2023,Abortion legal in Wisconsin as judge strikes down 19th-century law,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/abortion-legal-wisconsin-judge-strikes-down-law,"

A Wisconsin judge struck down a 19th-century law prohibiting abortions late Tuesday, making the procedure legal in the state up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The 1849 law restricting abortions was reinstated last year after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, but Dane County Judge Diane Schlipper interpreted the law to exclude “consensual abortions.”

KEVIN MCCARTHY LEAVING CONGRESS AT END OF YEAR: ‘LEAVING THE HOUSE BUT NOT THE FIGHT’

A consensual abortion is the intentional termination of pregnancy by the mother, which Schlipper wrote is distinct from “feticide,” the termination of pregnancy but without the consent of the mother, such as the death of the unborn child resulting from battery. The judge wrote the 1849 law only applies to “feticide.”

Despite the “feticide” distinction defined by Schlipper, the Wisconsin statute is titled “Abortion,” and it would send abortion-facilitating doctors to prison for up to six years on felony charges and impose fines of up to $10,000. The law also defines an unborn child as a “human being from the time of conception.”

“Although the plain meaning of the pre-Roe law prohibits elective induced abortions, the circuit court held the law does not apply to consensual abortions,” Carolyn McDonnell, litigation counsel for Americans United for Life, told the Washington Examiner. “This unfortunate decision authorizes abortion violence against preborn children, women, and families across Wisconsin.”

Democrats and other groups that support legal abortion are applauding the decision and vowing to charge forward with expanding abortion access in the state.

“While we celebrate this ruling, there is more to be done,” said Michelle Velasquez, chief strategy officer for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin. “We will continue essential work to help protect and expand reproductive freedom in Wisconsin so that everyone who needs comprehensive reproductive healthcare in our state can get the nonjudgmental and compassionate care they deserve.”

In September, Schlipper allowed Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin to resume providing abortions in Milwaukee and Madison after issuing a preliminary decision on the law. With the final decision, Velasquez said her organization would start abortions in the Sheboygan location as soon as possible.

Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director Matt Sande called Schlipper’s reasoning an “extraordinary leap in logic,” calling for an appeal of the decision.

Tuesday’s decision also opens the opportunity for the local district attorneys defending the law to file their appeal, and it could set up a state Supreme Court battle over abortion law, which has long been anticipated after the election of Justice Janet Protasiewicz, who solidified a 4-3 liberal majority on the court after running as openly supportive of expanding legal abortion.

Shortly after the overturn of Roe, Gov. Tony Evers (D-WI) and Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a challenge to the state’s 174-year-old abortion law."

Schlipper's ruling was announced Tuesday night. She reaffirmed her July ruling that Wisconsin state law allows abortions.

In Wisconsin's most recent election cycle, abortion access was a major issue to voters as conservative lawmakers interpreted an 1849 law as an abortion ban. However, Schlipper ruled the law is a ban on feticide, not abortion.

Umanski said Wednesday he plans to appeal Schlipper's decision. He released the following statement to 27 News:

""As I have previously stated, I believe that, properly interpreted, the statute at issue prohibits performing abortions (including consensual abortions) unless the exception for abortions necessary to save the life of the mother applies.

""The Dane County Circuit Court has held otherwise, and I am obligated to comply with that ruling unless the decision is stayed pending appeal or ultimately reversed. To be clear, I disagree with and intend to appeal the decision.

""In my view, the statute plainly applies to abortions and, while it may be that the citizens of the State of Wisconsin would be better served by a different statute, I do not believe it is my job or the role of the courts to make that determination. It is an issue for the Legislature and the governor to resolve."""
Dec 13 2023,Local abortion restrictions at stake as New Mexico high court hears key case,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/local-abortion-restrictions-new-mexico-high-court,"

The New Mexico Supreme Court will decide whether conservative cities and counties can keep their local abortion restrictions in a state that otherwise allows the procedure up to the moment of birth.

The Land of Enchantment’s high court is hearing oral arguments Wednesday in a challenge from state Attorney General Raul Torrez, a Democrat who has argued that the local laws violate New Mexico’s equal rights amendment in the state constitution, which bars discrimination based on sex and being pregnant.

BOB GOOD OUTLINES VISION TO PROMOTE ‘CONSERVATIVE CONSCIENCE’ AS NEW FREEDOM CAUCUS LEADER

New Mexico has become a destination for people seeking abortions from neighboring states such as Texas, Utah, Arizona, and Oklahoma, all of which enacted restrictions after the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Abortion rates in the state have more than tripled since last summer, and roughly 75% of cases came from outside New Mexico.

The cities of Hobbs and Clovis, as well as Lea and Roosevelt counties, enacted ordinances using an 1873 federal anti-vice law, the Comstock Act, which prohibits the shipping of anything that can be used to induce abortion. They argue that the ordinances cannot be struck down until federal courts decide the meaning of the Act, which has been narrowed over the years but never repealed.

Those cities and counties are using the law to stop the mailing of abortion-related medical supplies and abortion pills, creating de facto bans in each area.

Since the start of the case, other localities in New Mexico have enacted similar restrictions.

Advocates of the law who do not support abortion, including Right to Life of East Texas director Mark Lee Dickson, see it as a federal entry point for local leaders to set restrictions on abortion even in states with the most permissive abortion laws, such as New Mexico. The state is one of seven in the country that allows terminating pregnancies until the moment of birth.

Dec 13 2023,Fox News buried the story of a Texas woman prevented from getting an emergency abortion,Media Matters,left,https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-buried-story-texas-woman-prevented-getting-emergency-abortion,"On December 5, Cox filed a lawsuit in Texas for an emergency court-ordered abortion “to protect her health, life, and future fertility.” Cox, who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time the suit was filed, sought the abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and “had no chance of survival.” In addition, the lawsuit detailed how Cox had visited three different emergency rooms in the past month with “severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks” and was “at high risk for many serious medical conditions that pose risks to her future fertility and can become suddenly and unexpectedly life-threatening” if she did not undergo an abortion. The suit also included a recommendation from Cox’s OB-GYN, who stated they have a “good faith” belief that Cox should be exempted from the ban.

Texas’ current abortion ban restricts all abortions after six weeks, a period during which pregnancy would mostly not even be able to be detected, effectively banning all abortions. The ban makes narrow exceptions for “medical emergency” cases where the pregnancy “places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.""

The lawsuit articulates that Texas’ abortion law is inconsistent, causing confusion over which pregnancies qualify for an exception. The December 7 district court ruling allowed Cox to legally terminate her pregnancy. Paxton responded to the ruling by writing that Cox had failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to the pregnancy that puts her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm, warning doctors they could be liable for civil and criminal penalties for providing Cox an abortion, and petitioning for intervention from the Texas Supreme Court. The following day, the court temporarily blocked Cox from receiving an abortion and, on December 11, reversed the district court’s ruling. In the opinion, the court argued that “some difficulties in pregnancy … even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses.” By the time of the ruling, Cox had already left Texas to have the abortion out of state."

Nov 17 2023,Petition effort to get abortion on the ballot in Neb. kicks off,Fox Nebraska KFXL,center,https://foxnebraska.com/newsletters/petition-effort-to-get-abortion-on-the-ballot-in-neb-kicks-off,"The effort to get abortion on the ballot in Nebraska ramped up with a petition launch Thursday.

, a coalition of civil rights and advocacy groups, is leading the effort to enshrine abortion rights within the Nebraska Constitution.





The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until ""fetal viability"", or when the need is there to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.

“Every person deserves the freedom to make their own health care decisions, which include abortion and pregnancy access. We should be able to get the care that we need with compassion and privacy without political interference. Unfortunately, that is not the case,” said Ashlei Spivey, executive director of .

Spivey said, in the first two weeks since the coalition announced that they had filed their initial ballot language with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office hundreds of people from across the state have signed up to volunteer.

“Nebraskans must be able to access abortion are when we need it. One in four women will need an abortion. When it comes to pregnancy care, health – not politics – should drive medical decisions,” said Dr. Mary Kinyun, OBGYN physician and Nebraska native.

Several Nebraska lawmakers have expressed their support for a total or near-total abortion ban, including Gov. Jim Pillen.





State Senator Joni Albrecht led the effort to ultimately pass a 12-week abortion ban earlier this year.





""This extreme proposal would allow late-term abortion throughout pregnancy, eliminate health and safety standards, and allow minors to obtain abortions without parental notification,” Albrecht said in a statement on Wednesday. “Abortion is legal in the first trimester in Nebraska with clear exceptions for the life of the mother and medical emergencies throughout pregnancy. An amendment that jeopardizes the health and safety of women and abandons babies who deserve love and protection to painful late-term abortion procedures must be rejected.""

“Nebraska’s law currently allows abortion throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but that isn’t enough for the abortion industry and activists who are trying to write second- and third-trimester abortions into our constitution. This amendment would allow for abortion until the moment of birth,” Executive Director Sandy Danek. “This ballot measure is not pro-choice, it’s pro-abortion, and it does not reflect the values of Nebraskans.”

Protect Our Rights will need to collect around 125,000 valid signatures by next summer to get the measure on the November 2024 ballot."

Wade, battles over abortion rights are far from over.

Wyoming’s Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso joined 25 other Republicans earlier this month in signing a letter demanding that the U.S. Department of Defense rescind its policy of covering travel expenses for service members and their dependents seeking abortions.

After the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization last year, Department of Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin issued memorandums stating that the department can pay for travel expenses for active duty personnel and their dependents to get abortions outside the state where they’re stationed — 14 states across the country now have full bans on the procedure, according to The New York Times.

Prior to the policy announced by Austin, the military didn’t facilitate abortions except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother’s life was endangered, the letter notes.

“Now taxpayers—many of whom have deeply-held religious and moral objections to abortions—are on the hook to facilitate the very abortions they fundamentally oppose,” the letter says.

The letter comes as a Republican senator from Alabama, Tommy Tuberville, has blocked hundreds of confirmations and promotions for senior military officers in an attempt to strongarm the Department of Defense into dropping the policy. Democrats in the Senate, however, have put forward a resolution that attempts to skirt the block.

Though abortion up to viability is still legal in Wyoming, there will soon only be one clinic — Wellspring Health Access in Casper — in the entire state that offers abortion services. The Jackson Women’s Health and Family Care Clinic, which currently also provides abortion services, is slated to close on Dec. 15 because of financial strain, KHOL first reported.

An abortion ban that Gov. Mark Gordon allowed to become law earlier this year is blocked for now as it undergoes scrutiny in a court battle along with another law that aimed to specifically ban medicated abortions. A hearing for summary judgement in the case is set for Dec. 14."

(AP) — A Wisconsin judge on Tuesday reaffirmed her ruling from earlier this year that state law permits consensual medical abortions, opening up appellate options for conservatives.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the court’s landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion, in June 2022 reactivated an 1849 Wisconsin law that conservatives interpreted as banning abortion. Abortion providers ceased operations in the state out of fear of violating the ban.

Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul filed a lawsuit days after the U.S. Supreme Court decision challenging the ban’s validity. He argued the statutes were too old to enforce and a 1985 law permitting abortions before fetuses can survive outside the womb trump the ban. Three doctors later joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs, saying they fear being prosecuted for performing abortions.

Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled this past July that the ban prohibits someone from attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child but doesn’t apply to consensual medical abortions. Her finding didn’t formally end the lawsuit but Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin was confident enough in the ruling to resume abortion procedures at their Madison and Milwaukee clinics in September.

Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, asked Schlipper to reconsider her conclusion.

Schlipper refused in a 14-page ruling issued Tuesday, writing that Urmanski failed to show how she misapplied state law or made any other mistake and declared that the plaintiffs had won the suit.

Urmanski’s attorney, listed in online court records as Andrew Phillips, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The lawsuit is likely far from over. The ruling opens the door for conservatives to appeal and a case of this magnitude will likely end up before the state Supreme Court. Liberal justices currently control the court, making it likely that Schlipper’s ruling will stand.

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it expects to resume abortion procedures at its facility in Sheboygan “as soon as possible.”

“Today’s ruling is another important step forward in restoring and expanding access to abortion in Wisconsin,” the organization said.

Kaul called the ruling a “momentous victory.”

“Freedom wins. Equality wins. Women’s health wins,” he said in a statement.

Nov 16 2023,Coalition launches initiative to put abortion on the 2024 Nebraska ballot,KOLN,center,https://1011now.com/2023/11/17/coalition-launches-initiative-put-abortion-2024-nebraska-ballot,"OMAHA, Neb. (KOLN) - The fight over abortion has raged in the Nebraska Legislature for years now, resulting in a law that brought abortion access down from 20 weeks to 12 weeks in May.

Now, organizers want to take that issue directly to voters on the next statewide ballot.

“Every single Nebraskan of voting age will have the opportunity to vote for themselves to protect our rights,” said Andi Curry Grubb, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska. “I have no doubt that we will succeed in this effort.”

The Protect Our Rights coalition gathered to launch their campaign to enshrine access to abortion in the Nebraska Constitution, something organizers say is needed now more than ever.

“We know that a majority of senators have said they would pass a total ban if given that opportunity,” Ashlei Spivey, the founder of I Be Black Girl, said. “And guess what, we won’t give them that opportunity.”

The language the coalition settled on focused on protecting abortion access up until fetal viability, which can be case-by-case but generally happens around 23 weeks into a pregnancy.

Gov. Jim Pillen slammed the initiative, saying in part quote, “This flawed initiative would radically expand abortion in Nebraska, resulting in the deaths of thousands of babies in mothers’ wombs. Its vague and deceptive language could throw open the doors to brutal late-term abortions...”

Organizers disagree, saying week-based bans are arbitrary and that the viability standard puts the patient first.

“The purpose of having this language built allows us to tailor this to meet the patient need where it is,” Dr. Mary Kinyoun, an OBGYN, said.

The Nebraska Pro-Life Coalition has also criticized the language, saying quote, “by using the words ‘all persons’ rather than ‘women’ in the amendment, this will mean parents will not have any ability to consent or even know if their minor daughter seeks an abortion.”

Organizers said this wouldn’t touch parental consent laws.

The road to more than 120,000 signatures by July is a long one, but as coalitions form on both sides, it’s an issue that will be at the heart of Nebraska politics next year.

Organizers add they’re putting together the petitions right now and they’ll be ready by next week. They’ll need to get at least 5% of voters from 38 counties to sign on.

Dec 05 2023,Republicans in New Hampshire Want to Ban Abortion After 15 ... Days,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/new-hampshire-republicans-ban-abortion-15-days-1234911290,"New Hampshire is a state that puts a lot of stock in the concept of freedom. “Live Free or Die” is stamped on its license plates; it’s home to the libertarian-baiting “Free State Project”; and just a few weeks ago, the governor celebrated its ranking as the “freest state” in the country, according to the Cato Institute.

But that embrace of freedom apparently only extends so far. A group of Republicans from both the state House and Senate have announced plans to introduce a bill that would ban almost all abortions after just 15 days gestation.

The bill is effectively a total ban on abortion. The absolute earliest a woman can confirm she is pregnant is with a blood test 10 days after ovulation. But this proposed law does not ban abortion 15 days after ovulation — it bans abortion at 15 days gestation, counted from the first day of a woman’s last menstrual cycle… which means it would ban abortion before some woman have even had conceived. The only proposed exception to the law is for a medical emergency.

If passed, it would be among the most restrictive bans in the country.

Abortion is currently legal through 24 weeks gestation in New Hampshire; medical professionals who provide abortions after that point face both civil and criminal penalties. (Earlier this year, members of both the Republican and Democratic House caucuses sought to remove criminal and civil penalties associated with that ban, but the effort failed in Senate.)

Republicans currently hold a trifecta in New Hampshire, with GOP majorities in the House and Senate and a Republican occupying the governor’s mansion. But control of the House — the largest in the country with 400 members — sits on a knife’s edge. There are 198 Republicans and 195 Democrats, three independents, and four vacant seats.

The Republican-led attack on reproductive rights has the potential to change that calculus.

Two-thirds of voters in New Hampshire support keeping abortion legal in all or most cases, according to the most recent Pew Research data, and at least one of the bill’s co-sponsors, Rep. John Sellers, is in a vulnerable seat after winning by just four votes in 2022. Editor’s picks

The proposed ban is notable in part because just a few weeks ago New Hampshire’s Committee to Elect House Republicans declared that the state’s abortion laws were just as liberal as neighboring Massachusetts.

Abortion is accessible in New Hampshire and in line with most states in our region – most notably, Massachusetts.

“New Hampshire Democrats are lying about abortion because they can’t run on anything else,” the group wrote. Reached for comment by Rolling Stone, GOP Rep. Jason Osborne, chairman of the committee, called House Bill 1248-FN “no-chance legislation supported by only a few fringe members.”

Republicans “claim that they don’t want to ban abortion anymore, and that they don’t want to change the 24 week ban. And here we are, with a bill from sponsors in both chambers, trying to move the ban to 15 days,” says Alexis Simpson, deputy minority leader of the New Hampshire House. Simpson pointed to other proposals floated by GOP members to restrict abortion, including a Texas-style abortion bounty law in 2021, and 15-week ban that is expected to be introduced in the upcoming session.

“The only way to protect access to abortion is to break up the New Hampshire Republican trifecta by electing Democrats to the legislature,” Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement shared with Rolling Stone. “Democrats have won 5 seats in the House in 2023 and remain within striking distance of flipping the chamber.”

Nov 16 2023,Nebraska coalition press to include abortion rights in state constitution,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/nebraska-coalition-press-abortion-rights-state-constitution,"An effort to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution is being launched, following on the heels of successful efforts in other red states where Republicans had enacted or sought abortion restrictions.

Protect Our Rights, the coalition behind the effort, submitted proposed petition language to the Nebraska Secretary of State's office late last month.

That language was kept under wraps until Wednesday, when the state's top elections office released it. Organizers plan to hold a news conference Thursday to kick off the effort, in which they will need to collect around 125,000 valid signatures by next summer to get the measure on the ballot in 2024.

NEBRASKA WOMAN, 18, GETS 90 DAYS FOR GETTING ILLEGAL ABORTION WITH MOM'S HELP, BURNING FETUS

NEBRASKA WOMAN WHO HELPED BURN, CONCEAL DAUGHTER'S ABORTION GETS 2-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE

""We're confident in this effort, and we're energized,"" said Ashlei Spivey, founder and executive director of I Be Black Girl, an Omaha-based reproductive rights group that makes up part of the coalition. Other members include Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Women's Fund.

The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Under the petition language, the patient's health care practitioner would determine fetal viability.

The group relied, in part, on polling it says shows a majority of Nebraskans favoring abortion access, Spivey said. That's proving consistent in other states where voters have backed abortion rights — including in Ohio, where voters last week resoundingly approved an amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion access.

""Ohio was definitely a proof point for us,"" Spivey said. ""Ohio shows that voters are going to protect their rights.""

Now, advocates in at least a dozen states are looking to take abortion questions to voters in 2024.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes neighboring conservative Kansas, where voters resoundingly rejected last year a ballot measure that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.

Paige Brown, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Catholic Conference that has lobbied hard for abortion restrictions, telegraphed that abortion opponents are aware of the public pushback.

""Nebraska’s major pro-life groups are not pursuing our own ballot initiative,"" Brown said in a written statement. Instead, she said, they will focus on defending Nebraska's current 12-week abortion ban passed by the Republican-led Legislature earlier this year that includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.

""The vast majority of Nebraskans agree this is reasonable public policy,"" Brown said.

A petition seeking a 2024 referendum to outright ban abortion in Nebraska that was approved earlier this year has been suspended after the lone organizer was unable to raise enough volunteers to circulate it.

NEBRASKA MOM PLEADS GUILTY TO HELPING DAUGHTER, 17, OBTAIN ILLEGAL ABORTION

Despite indications that further restrictions are unpopular, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and other Republican leaders have vowed to do just that, even as others have warned it could cost them elections. Republican state Sen. Merve Riepe, who tanked a 6-week ban bill by refusing to end a filibuster on it, took to the legislative floor in April to urge his conservative colleagues to heed signs that abortion will galvanize women to vote them out of office.

""We must embrace the future of reproductive rights,"" he said at the time.

Ashley All, who helped lead the effort in Kansas to protect abortion rights, echoed that warning, noting Kansas voters rejected that state's anti-abortion effort by nearly 20 percentage points.

""For 50 years, all we’ve heard is a very specific stereotype of who gets an abortion and why,"" All said. ""But when you start to disrupt that stereotype and show how abortion is health care, people’s perceptions and opinions begin to shift."""

Nov 15 2023,Oklahoma Supreme Court temporarily halts slew of abortion restrictions,Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/oklahoma-supreme-court-temporarily-halts-slew-abortion-restrictions,"The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday temporarily halted three state laws governing abortion and the prescription of abortion bills pending further proceedings.

Abortion is almost completely illegal in the state, allowing only the exception in which a pregnancy presents a risk to the mother's life. Planned Parenthood, the Center for Reproductive Rights, and the Tulsa Women's Clinic joined forces to challenge five state laws regulating abortion, three of which the court temporarily blocked on Wednesday, the Washington Examiner reported.

The coalition originally brought the suit in 2021, at which time the Oklahoma County District Court blocked the other two laws, but declined to block those the Supreme Court stayed on Wednesday. The three newly-blocked laws require that a certified OB/GYN conduct an abortion, that only such a person may prescribe abortion pills, and that the state Board of Pharmacy track the manufacturing and distribution of said pills.

The court ruled 5-4 to grant the stays.

""This is welcome news, but the devastating reality is that Oklahomans still do not have access to the abortion care they need. The right to abortion is a human right, and Oklahomans deserve to access such essential healthcare without barriers,"" Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Rabia Muqaddam said.

Oklahoma maintains some of the strictest abortion laws nationwide. In the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision in 2022, roughly half of U.S. states have moved to limit or outright ban abortion, though nearly every such law has attracted legal scrutiny at the state level.

Though the Dobbs decision determined that the U.S. Constitution does not provide any right to abortion, the matter largely remains unresolved at the state level and some courts, such as the Supreme Court of South Carolina, have found that their constitutions do convey some right to abortion.

In January of this year, the bench struck down a six-week abortion ban in the Palmetto State, but subsequently upheld a similar law in August after one justice retired and legislators made minor tweaks.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cox family Cox family

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old woman from the Dallas area facing pregnancy complications who had sued the state of Texas for access to an abortion, has left the state to get the procedure, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

""This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,"" Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, wrote in a statement. ""Her health is on the line. She's been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer."" The group notes that Cox is not giving interviews and that the details about where she traveled for the abortion is not being disclosed to the public.

On Monday evening, hours after Cox's lawyers announced her decision to leave the state for care, the Texas Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case. It found that her lawyers and doctor had not proven she was eligible for an abortion under Texas's narrow exception to its abortion ban.

Texas enacted some of the strictest abortion laws in the country, before and after the constitutional right to an abortion was repealed when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

The state has become a focus of legal action from patients and doctors seeking to clarify how those laws will be enforced. With this ruling, a picture is emerging in which doctors must decide when to apply the medical exception — and they can face extreme penalties up to life in prison if they get it wrong in the eyes of Texas law enforcement.

A fast-moving case

In late November, Cox received ""devastating"" news about her pregnancy, according to the petition filed in a Texas district court last week. At nearly 20-weeks gestation, she learned that her fetus has Trisomy 18 or Edwards Syndrome, a condition with extremely low chances of survival. Fetuses with Trisomy 18 often die before birth or just after.

Cox was also having issues with her health. She had been in the emergency room four times in two weeks with cramping and other concerning symptoms, according to court documents and her lawyer. Her doctors told her she was at high risk of developing gestational hypertension and diabetes. She also has two children already, and because she had had two prior cesarean sections, carrying the pregnancy to term could compromise her chances of having a third child in the future, the brief says.

The filing asked Judge Maya Guerra Gamble to allow the abortion to be performed in the state, where abortion is banned with very limited exceptions. Two days later, on Dec 7, District Court Judge Gamble ruled from the bench that the abortion should be permitted.

That same day, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed the ruling and sent a letter, shared on social media, addressed to all of the hospitals where Dr. Damla Karsan has admitting privileges. Karsan is a plaintiff in Cox's case as a physician who has met her and reviewed her medical chart, and who is willing to provide an abortion with the backing of the courts.

The Paxton letter says the hospitals and Karsan could still face felony charges and fines of no less than $100,000. It also says the hospitals could be liable for ""potential regulatory and civil violations"" if they allow Cox to have an abortion.

On Friday, Dec 8, the Texas Supreme Court put a temporary hold on Judge Gamble's ruling, pending review.

In its ruling issued Dec. 11, the state's high court said, ""Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses.""

It also said that doctors, not judges should be deciding whether the exception applies. The ruling reads, ""Dr. Karsan asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox's condition poses the risks the exception requires.""

A request for clarity

There are currently three overlapping abortion bans in Texas. Abortion is illegal in the state from the moment pregnancy begins. Texas doctors can legally provide abortions in the state only if a patient is ""in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function,"" the law says.

Doctors, hospitals and lawyers have asked for clarity on what ""serious risk"" of a major bodily function entails, and the Texas attorney general's office has held that the language is clear.

In open court in a previous case, an assistant attorney general for Texas suggested that doctors who delayed abortions for certain women who nearly died in complicated pregnancies were committing malpractice, and not applying the Texas abortion bans correctly.

In this case, Paxton argues in his letter to hospitals that Cox did not meet the standard laid out in the medical exception. Her petition to the court ""fails to identify what 'life-threatening' medical condition that Ms. Cox purportedly has that is aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy, nor does it state with specificity how this unidentified condition places Ms. Cox at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced.""

The Texas Supreme Court sided with Paxton and vacated the order of the lower court that would have allowed Cox to get the abortion in Texas.

The Center for Reproductive Rights has repeatedly asserted that the exception language is vague and confusing for doctors and hospitals charged with making these calls, which is why it petitioned the court on Cox's behalf.

Judge Gamble in her ruling said that Cox should be able to get the procedure to preserve her ability to have future children. Blocking her from having the abortion would be a ""genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Gamble said.

The petition argued that Cox did qualify for a legal abortion because of the risks to her future fertility if she carried the pregnancy to term. ""If she has to be induced, there is a risk of uterine rupture,"" Cox lawyer Molly Duane told NPR. ""If she has to have a repeat c-section, there is a risk of, again, uterine rupture and hysterectomy and she won't be able to try again for more children in the future, which she desperately wants to do.""

Duane, who is a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, also argued that the fact that Cox's fetus is very unlikely to survive is relevant to the case. ""While there are serious concerns with her baby's health, there are also serious concerns with her own health and you cannot tease those apart – they are inextricably intertwined,"" Duane said."
Aug 07 2023,Court Decision On Abortion,East Texas Radio,center,https://easttexasradio.com/court-decision-on-abortion,"The Texas Tribune reports that State District Judge Jessica Mangrum of Travis County Friday issued a temporary exemption to the state’s abortion ban that would allow women with complicated pregnancies to obtain the procedure and keep doctors free from prosecution if they determined the fetus would not survive after birth. In her ruling, Mangrum wrote that the law restricting abortion access, was unconstitutional. But, only a few hours later, the Texas Attorney General’s office filed an appeal with the Texas Supreme Court, blocking the judge’s order from taking effect."

Nov 15 2023,Left-Wing Activists Launch Abortion Ballot Initiative in Nebraska,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/15/left-wing-activists-launch-nebraska-abortion-ballot-initiative-after-ohio-victory,"A coalition of left-wing groups is officially launching its effort to enshrine the supposed “right” to abortion into the Nebraska constitution on the heels of a pro-life loss in Ohio on November 7.

Protect Our Rights, a coalition endorsed by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Nebraska and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, submitted proposed petition language to the Nebraska Secretary of State in October. The language was “kept under wraps until Wednesday, when the state’s top elections office released it,” the Associated Press reported. Organizers are officially holding a news conference on Thursday.

The proposed amendment would reportedly declare a fundamental right to abortion until “fetal viability”— which is generally considered to be between 22 to 24 weeks of gestation — or “when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient,” according to the report.

“Under the petition language, the patient’s health care practitioner would determine fetal viability,” the report states.

The left-wing coalition must collect roughly 125,000 valid signatures by summer 2024 for the amendment to appear on the ballot in 2024.

“We’re confident in this effort, and we’re energized,” said Ashlei Spivey, founder and executive director of I Be Black Girl, an Omaha-based reproductive rights group and coalition member.

Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill in May 2023 that restricts abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and outlaws “gender-affirming care” for minors. Before the 12-week limit was in effect, Nebraska limited abortions to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Paige Brown, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Catholic Conference, told AP the state’s major pro-life groups will be focusing on defending the state’s current limit, which includes exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother.

“The vast majority of Nebraskans agree this is reasonable public policy,” Brown said.

After the fall of Roe, which had invented a federal “right” to abortion in the Constitution, abortion was returned to individual states and their elected representatives, changing the nature of the struggle between the pro-life movement and the abortion industry. Pro-abortion organizations and activists, backed by the affiliates of large left-wing organizations like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, have stealthily turned to ballot measures in the hopes of shoring up and even growing the abortion complex in the shift from federal to state power.

And so far, their plan is working — every single abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. During the 2022 special elections, Kansans rejected a ballot measure that would have established that the state constitution does not include a right to abortion. During the 2022 midterms, voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont codified abortion into their constitutions. At the same time, voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have given rights to babies born alive in botched abortions. Voters in Kentucky also rejected an amendment similar to the one in Kansas. On November 7, Ohioans also voted to codify the supposed “right” to abortion in their state constitution via Issue 1.

Ballot measures are particularly effective as an offensive weapon because they are basically irreversible: they change a state constitution, take precedence over laws passed by state legislatures, and can only be overturned by another ballot measure.

These measures are propped up by national left-wing organizations with deep pockets, out-of-state dark money groups, and billionaires with eugenicist leanings, oftentimes outspending pro-life organizations by double or triple.

Emboldened by their success with amendments, pro-abortion activists are seeking to introduce ballot measures in several other states going into 2024 besides Nebraska, including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota.

In the aftermath of 2022 and Ohio, pro-life organizations say they are reevaluating how they want to tackle the issue moving forward — especially as they gear up to face a tsunami of ballot measures in 2024. These organizations, which cut their teeth for 50 years while working toward the overturn of Roe, are ultimately faced with the challenge of becoming as strategic and well-funded as their opponents while refusing to compromise on the view that human life begins at conception and is worthy of protection until natural death.

“The pro-life movement must adapt to win. We have to throw out the old playbook and dive headfirst into a strategy that can win the hearts and minds of the American people and translate into electoral victory,” founder and president of Live Action Lila Rose said in a statement via email following the loss in Ohio. “That strategy starts with fully embracing and educating on the truth. Human life is valuable and must be legally protected. Human life begins at fertilization. Abortion is a murderous act of violence. Embracing the truth with courage is the first step towards the next political victory.”

Kate Cox, a pregnant woman from the Dallas area who had sued Texas for access to an abortion, has left the state for one instead. The fast-moving case was pending before the state Supreme Court.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

Kate Cox, a woman with pregnancy complications who asked Texas courts for access to an abortion, has left the state for one instead. The fast-moving case was just filed last week and was pending before the state Supreme Court. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin is here to explain what happened. Hi there.

SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.

SUMMERS: Selena, let's start with Kate Cox. Remind us who she is and about her situation.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So she is 31 years old. She lives in the Dallas area with her husband and two young kids. And she was pregnant for the third time. About 20 weeks into her pregnancy, she learned her fetus has trisomy 18, which is a genetic condition with slim to no chance of survival. She also had gone to the ER multiple times with cramping and other symptoms. She reached out to the Center for Reproductive Rights, and they filed an emergency petition asking the Texas courts to suspend all of the abortion bans penalties against her, her husband and her doctor so she could receive an abortion in Texas.

SUMMERS: Right. And last week a district court judge granted that request. So what happened next?

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, right away, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. He also sent a letter alluding to possible fines, felony charges and regulatory claims against several hospitals that might have been the place for her to have an abortion. On Friday, the Texas Supreme Court put a hold on the case, so Cox was in legal limbo for several days. Of course, her pregnancy was progressing over those days. Her window to get an abortion was possibly closing. So now she's left the state for an abortion, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. So it seems likely that the case will be dismissed.

SUMMERS: And, Selena, how does this fit in with the other legal challenges that you've been following, the Texas abortion laws?

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: OK. So you and I have talked about the Zurawski case. So that's 20 patients who say the medical exception to the Texas abortion ban is too narrow and confusing to be useful, and that that harmed them. The Texas Supreme Court heard arguments in late November about that case, and a ruling could come in the next few weeks or months. What happened with Kate Cox is interesting to me for a few different reasons, even though it's a totally unrelated case.

SUMMERS: OK. Say more about that.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, first of all, the state of Texas has argued that the state didn't deny anyone an abortion, and that includes Amanda Zurawski, the lead plaintiff. After she was denied an abortion, she developed sepsis and ended up in the ICU. And I was there in the courtroom last July in Austin. And remember this question put to her by Assistant Attorney General Amy Pletcher.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

AMY PLETSCHER: At any time, did Attorney General Paxton tell you that you cannot receive an abortion?

AMANDA ZURAWSKI: I never spoke to Attorney General Ken Paxton directly, no.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She asked that question of every patient who testified. And in closing arguments, the state said, this isn't about Attorney General Ken Paxton. He didn't deny the abortion. It was the hospital's fault or the doctor's fault. But here, with Kate Cox, in this case, Paxton, in fact, did deny Cox an abortion she could have legally received if he hadn't intervened. And another point is that Texas has said patients with past pregnancy complications weren't actively being harmed by any laws, so they didn't have standing to sue here with this case. Kate Cox was in the middle of an emergency and did ask the state for permission to get an abortion. And now there's information about how Texas responded. It was a fast and ferocious denial. So she decided to seek care out of state, and her attorneys are not disclosing where she went.

SUMMERS: That is NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Selena, thank you.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.

Nov 24 2023,Nevada judge rules out abortion rights ballot push for 2024,New York Post (News),right,https://nypost.com/2023/11/24/news/nevada-judge-rules-out-abortion-ballot-initiative-for-2024,"A Nevada judge has nixed a 2024 ballot initiative to enshrine the right to have an abortion in the Silver State’s constitution.

Carson City District Court Judge James Russell sided Tuesday with the Coalition for Parents and Children PAC, who filed a lawsuit earlier this month claiming the abortion initiative violated Nevada law, Reno ABC affiliate KOLO-TV reported.

Jason Guinasso, an attorney for the PAC, argued Nov. 11 that the proposed ballot measure amounted to “log rolling” and included sweeping coverage of abortion, birth control, prenatal care and postpartum care — violating state law by allowing more than one subject on a petition, according to the station.

In his ruling, Russell agreed with Guinasso’s assessment.

“Again, it is clear to me this is probably the clearest case I have seen that I think there is a violation of the single subject rule,” the judge reportedly said.

5 Attorney Jason Guinasso in oral arguments on Nov. 11 said the ballot measure amounted to “log rolling” and violated state law for allowing more than one subject on a petition. AP

“I just, I’ve seen a lot of them over the years and in respect to this particular matter, there are too many subjects. Not all of which are functionally related to each other.”

Attorneys for Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union and Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom PAC disagreed with Guinasso’s argument — and abortion initiative supporters said they will appeal the ruling to the state Supreme Court.

“We are optimistic about the ballot initiative as a whole, and you know, we plan to appeal this,” said Lindsey Harmon, an attorney representing Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom. “And we know that in fact, these are all a single subject.”

The group first filed its petition on Sept. 14.

If the Nevada Supreme Court issues another unfavorable ruling, abortion rights proponents in the state could still collect more than 100,000 signatures by July 8 to force the issue onto the ballot for Election Day 2024.

The petition would amend Article 1 of the Nevada Constitution to state that “every individual has a fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which entails the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy, including, without limitation, prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage and infertility care.”

Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy in Nevada due to a 1990 ballot referendum that codified the protections in state law and the state’s constitution.

Ohio voters enacted a similar measure through a ballot initiative, passing an amendment to their state Constitution earlier this month by a majority vote to allow for abortion at any point during pregnancy.

The issue has become a flashpoint for national elections following the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization last year, which overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling ensuring constitutional protection for abortion nationwide.

The woman, Jessica Burgess, 42, was charged after the police found her private Facebook messages, which revealed plans she had with her daughter to end the pregnancy and “burn the evidence.”

Prosecutors said that Ms. Burgess ordered the pills online and gave them to her daughter, Celeste Burgess, in April 2022, when her daughter was 17 and in the third trimester of her pregnancy. The Burgesses later buried the fetal remains, the authorities said.

Ms. Burgess pleaded guilty in July to violating Nebraska’s abortion law, furnishing false information to a law enforcement officer and removing or concealing human skeletal remains. Celeste Burgess was sentenced in July to 90 days in jail and two years of probation after she pleaded guilty in May to removing or concealing human skeletal remains."

Dec 09 2023,New class-action lawsuit challenges Kentucky abortion bans.

Jane Doe, who used a pseudonym to protect her identity, filed the class-action lawsuit Friday on behalf of herself and any other person who is pregnant or could become pregnant and would want to get an abortion. She is eight weeks pregnant but wants to terminate it and cannot do so in Kentucky because of the abortion bans, which took effect last year.

""I am angry that now that I am pregnant and do not want to be, the government is interfering in my private matters and blocking me from having an abortion,"" Doe said in the release. ""I am bringing this lawsuit because I firmly believe that everyone should have the ability to make their own decisions about their pregnancies.""

Joining Doe in the suit are Planned Parenthood Great Northwest, Hawai‘i, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, which is being represented by attorney from the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Kentucky, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Craig Henry PLC, and O'Melveny & Myers LLP.

Kentucky's near-total ""trigger"" ban on the procedure and its prohibition on abortion after about six weeks of pregnancy were instituted in 2022, when Roe v. Wade was overturned by a Supreme Court decision.

Among the claims stipulated in the lawsuit, Doe says that establishing rulings to be enacted without approval from the General Assembly goes against the Kentucky Constitution.

""Section 60 of the Kentucky Constitution provides that 'No law . . . shall be enacted to take effect upon the approval of any authority other than the General Assembly, unless otherwise expressly provided in this Constitution,' the lawsuit states. ""This means that the General Assembly cannot make a law’s life and vitality depend upon the affirmative act of another.""

Does the abortion ban affect you?Submit a letter to the editor

Ebert Haegele, division chief for the Commonwealth’s Attorney's Office, said they received a copy of the lawsuit Friday and are awaiting the final deposition for pending cases before commenting.

Claims made in a lawsuit only represent one side of the case.

Here are the claims the abortion lawsuit stipulates

The total ban violates the right of privacy of each individual and, based on this, each person should have the right to seek an abortion if needed. The total ban violates the right of each person to have control over themselves and their body. The total ban violates three sections of the Kentucky Constitution that stipulate that the General Assembly has the authority in determining what is considered a crime. ""The General Assembly left it to the U.S. Supreme Court to determine the point at which abortion becomes a crime under Kentucky law,"" the lawsuit states. The total ban violates Section 60 of the Kentucky Constitution that the General Assembly is the government branch that enacts laws and left it to it become effective based on decisions made by the United States Supreme Court. It claimed the six-week ban also violates the right to privacy, as stated in the first claim. It claimed the six-week ban also violates the right of self-determination, as stated in the second claim. It claims pregnant people ""are suffering, and will continue to suffer, immediate and irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief preventing Defendants from enforcing the Bans."" The last claim is a declaratory judgment for the total ban and the six-week ban. “[A]ll laws … contrary to this Constitution, shall be void,"" according to the lawsuit.

""We at the ACLU of Kentucky said we would not rest until access to abortion was restored in our commonwealth,"" said Amber Duke, the executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky. ""We hope for a victory that aligns with the will of the people and overturns these unconstitutional bans.”

Women in Missouri could be charged with murder if they get an abortion under two bills pre-filed in the Missouri legislature.

The “Abolition of Abortion in Missouri Act” is sponsored by State Rep. Bob Titus, R, Billings, in the House and State Sen. Mike Moon, R-Ash Grove, in the Senate. It would extend criminal and civil laws protecting those already born to the unborn and repeal provisions of state law that “permit willful prenatal homicide or assault.”

Both HB 1508 and SB 775 would allow duress to be used as a legal defense by a woman charged with murder for having an abortion and would exempt abortions performed to save a woman’s life.

Missouri outlawed almost all abortions in the state last year when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade and ruled that states could regulate abortion on their own. There are several proposed constitutional amendments that would make abortions legal again in Missouri.

Dec 20 2023,Planned Parenthood Opens Carbondale Clinic Amid Influx of Out-of-State Patients Seeking Abortions,WTTW,center,https://news.wttw.com/2023/12/20/planned-parenthood-opens-carbondale-clinic-amid-influx-out-state-patients-seeking,"A new abortion clinic opened in Carbondale Tuesday — the physical manifestation of years of preparation by Planned Parenthood of Illinois for the post-Roe world that was realized in June 2022 with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

“We looked at the map and we knew that it was the best possible town in southern Illinois to serve the whole southern Illinois community, and it also is a great location for the surrounding states — none of which have access to abortion,” said Planned Parenthood of Illinois CEO Jennifer Welch. “It’s relatively easy to get to for our neighbors in Kentucky and Tennessee, and it even has a direct train line from New Orleans.”

Carbondale, population 21,717 and home to Southern Illinois University, is a five-hour drive from Chicago but a mere hour from the state’s southernmost city, Cairo.

The Carbondale Health Center offers a full range of reproductive and other services, including testing for sexually transmitted infections, HIV treatment, birth control and gender-affirming care.

An influx of out-of-state patients has come to Illinois for abortions since the Dobbs ruling.

According to a Guttmacher Institute report from September, the number of abortions performed in Illinois has increased by 69% since the end of Roe.

Illinois Department of Public Health data shows 51,797 Illinois abortions in 2021; Welch said Planned Parenthood has served patients from 40 states, and a quarter of its clientele come from outside Illinois.

“We’ve really been preparing for the post-Roe world for five years,” Welch said. “We opened in Flossmoor near the Indiana border, Waukegan near the Wisconsin border. We doubled the size of our Champaign health center, which is right down the road from Indianapolis. So we really have been building for this moment.”

The Flossmoor center opened in 2018 and Waukegan in 2020; the Champaign expansion was announced in 2022. Planned Parenthood also moved to a larger space in Chicago’s Loop last year.

The growth isn’t just in brick-and-mortar locations.

In the wake of the Dobbs ruling, Planned Parenthood has hired more staff, increased telehealth services and implemented a new patient records system.

Mary FioRito, a fellow with the Washington D.C.-based Ethics and Public Policy Center, a thinktank focused on folding traditional Christian and Jewish values into modern policy, said the spike in abortions and the added clinics are evidence of misplaced priorities.

FioRito said Illinois’ focus on protecting the right to an abortion “is masquerading as something that’s good for us (women) and it’s not.”

“It makes me really sad that in Illinois this is the best we can offer women,” FioRito said. “And we’re not offering things like extended maternity leave.”

Abortions, she said, are viewed as a “cheap, quick-fix solution” that in actuality are acts of desperation that result in letting businesses off the hook for caring for and accommodating pregnant women.

Planned Parenthood of Illinois’ building boom is over for now. Welch said the organization has no plans for additional health centers.

“We are going to focus on these locations,” Welch said. “This means that we have health centers from the northern border in Waukegan all the way down to the southern border in Carbondale. And now it’s a matter of getting patients to the care that they need that is best for them.”

Still, one more clinic is expected to open in the first half of 2024: the facility in Peoria, which has been closed since it was firebombed 11 months ago. At the time, Welch estimated repairs would cost more than $1 million.

WGLT reported in August that 32-year-old Tyler Massengill of Chillicothe was sentenced to 10 years after pleading guilty to arson for the Jan. 15 firebombing.

“I feel like that one comes with a special vengeance for me,” Welch said. “That offender cost his community thousands and thousands of patient visits for essential care.”

Dec 07 2023,Texas Threatens Doctors After Judge Says Woman Can Get Emergency Abortion,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/texas-threatens-doctors-judge-emergency-abortion-1234920048,"Last week, Kate Cox, 20 weeks pregnant and a mother of two, received the worst news a person can get: her baby had a fatal condition known as Trisomy 18. The baby has no chance of survival, but under Texas law, there are only two options available to Cox: a vaginal delivery, or a C-section. Either option would risk her life or her ability to have children in the future.

Because of her two prior C-sections, Cox’s doctors advised her she is at a high risk for a uterine rupture if she has an induced labor; if she had a third C-section, it would increase the chances that she is unable to carry a future pregnancy to term. On Tuesday, Cox’s lawyers filed an emergency lawsuit, asking the court to temporarily block the state’s bans so Cox could obtain an abortion.

Travis County Judge Maya Guerra Gamble heard from both Cox’s lawyers and the state of Texas — whose lawyer argued that Cox didn’t meet the threshold for a medical exception to the state’s multiple abortion bans — earlier this week. The case marks the first time a woman has asked a judge to approve an emergency abortion since the Supreme Court struck down the federal right to abortion last year.

On Thursday, Judge Gamble reportedly teared up as she read her opinion from the bench: “The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice.” She granted the temporary restraining order, clearing a path for Cox to obtain an emergency abortion.

Cox, Gamble wrote in her opinion, “has already been to three emergency rooms with severe cramping, diarrhea, and leaking unidentifiable fluid. If she is forced to continue this pregnancy, Ms. Cox is at a particularly high risk for gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, fetal macrosomia, post-operative infections, anesthesia complications, uterine rupture, and hysterectomy, due to her two prior C-sections and underlying health conditions.” Editor’s picks

Texas attorney general Ken Paxton wasted no time threatening anyone who would aid Cox in obtaining an abortion.

“The temporary restraining order granted by the Travis County district judge purporting to allow an abortion to proceed will not insulate hospitals, doctors or anyone else from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws,” Paxton said in a statement shortly after the judge’s decision. “This includes first degree felony prosecutions…and civil penalties of not less than $100,000 for each violation.

Paxton added, ominously: “The [judge’s temporary restraining order] will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires.” Trending Actor and Drag Star Shangela Accused of Multiple Sexual Assaults RBG Award Gala Canceled After Justice's Family, Barbra Streisand Denounce Honorees Cheech & Chong Return for One 'Last Movie' Right-Wingers Are Terrified of Our Gay Kristen Stewart Cover

The attorney general went on to dispatch letters to three Houston-area hospitals where the doctor who was to perform Cox’s abortion has admitting privileges, threatening them with civil and criminal penalties if the abortion were to take place.

“We feel it is important for you to understand the potential long-term implications if you permit such an abortion to occur at your facility,” Paxton wrote, adding that the hospitals “may be liable for negligently credentialing the physician and failing to exercise appropriate professional judgment, among other potential regulatory and civil violations.”"
Dec 19 2023,Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards Walks Back Alleged Comments Telling Woman to Get an Abortion with $100K Payoff,People,left,https://people.com/nba-star-anthony-edwards-addresses-alleged-abortion-demand-8418027,"Minnesota Timberwolves shooting guard Anthony Edwards is speaking out amid accusations that he told a woman to get an abortion.

In posts on social media, Paige Jordae shared alleged screenshots of her text messages with Edwards, 22, claiming that he impregnated her and then pressured her into getting an abortion, according to multiple outlets including Fox Sports and the New York Post.

In response to a photo Jordae apparently sent of a positive pregnancy test and information about an upcoming doctor's visit, Edwards allegedly wrote, ""Hell naw I can't do this,"" and ""Get a abortion lol,"" in his text messages to the aspiring Instagram model.

In one message, Jordae allegedly told Edwards, who was the top pick in the 2020 NBA Draft, that she had an abortion two years ago and did not want to get another.

""Honestly I had an abortion with my son around 2 years ago and I regret it everyday,"" Jordae shared with him via text message.

The NBA star's response to that confession was allegedly, ""Man you can't force a kid in da world,"" before reminding her she ""doesn't know"" the sex of the baby yet.

Screenshots show that Edwards allegedly offered Jordae $100,000 to get the abortion, and then pressured her into sending him a video of herself taking the pills for proof.

""You got the money now,"" Edwards apparently wrote in a text asking her what ""the hold up"" was in sending the requested video.

According to the woman's claims on social media, she sent Edwards an AI-created image of what their baby may look like on Nov. 26, writing, ""Look how cute.""

Edwards' alleged response was back-to-back demands for Jordae to ""send da video"" before two additional, differently worded requests for the footage.

On Nov. 27, Jordae apparently took the first dose of abortion pills and sent Edwards the video he requested. That same day, Jordae claims the athlete sent her $100,000 in a wire transfer via JP Morgan & Chase.

Edwards allegedly didn't respond to a Dec. 1 message from Jordae, according to the screenshots she shared, and when she asked if he was planning to ""ignore"" her moving forward, Edwards allegedly wrote back, ""My attorney gone handle it.""

PEOPLE has reached out to Edwards' agent and the Minnesota Timberwolves for comment.

The claims quickly made the rounds on social media, and Edwards addressed the allegations in a statement on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday.

""I made comments in the heat of a moment that are not me, and that are not aligned with what I believe and who I want to be as a man,"" Edwards began in his statement. ""All women should be supported and empowered to make their own decisions about their bodies and what is best for them,"" he continued.

The Timberwolves star said he will be ""handling my personal matters privately"" and ""will not be commenting on them any further at this time.""

After Edwards spoke out, Jordae thanked her friends and followers for their support. ""Thank you to everyone who has personally reached out and checked in on me,"" she wrote in an Instagram story, adding that the support ""doesn’t go unnoticed.""

Jordae didn't specifically address Edwards in her post on Monday, but she said the situation ""has all been very overwhelming for everyone involved.""

Edwards' ordeal with Jordae is not the first time the NBA star has issued an apology statement on social media.

In Sept. 2022, he faced backlash for an Instagram story in which he made homophobic comments about a group of people on the street.

According to the New York Times, the NBA handed Edwards a $40,000 fine for the incident.

“What I said was immature, hurtful, and disrespectful, and I’m incredibly sorry,” Edwards wrote in a statement on X at the time. “It’s unacceptable for me or anyone to use that language in such a hurtful way, there’s no excuse for it, at all. I was raised better than that!”

In August, Edwards was fined by the NBA again and cited for third-degree assault, according to ESPN, for ""recklessly swinging a chair in frustration that struck two bystanders"", according to the league's statement, after a playoff game in April when he missed a 3-point overtime buzzer-beater that would eliminate Minnesota from the playoffs.

After the incident in April, Edwards' attorney Harvey Steinberg told ESPN that the Denver Police Department's charges — which the NBA noted have been ""dismissed"" — were ""baseless.""

""With the game over, Anthony's exit from the court was partially obstructed by a chair, which he moved and set down three steps later,"" Steinberg said at the time.

He continued: ""As video of the incident confirms, Anthony did not swing the chair at anyone and of course did not intend to hurt anyone. Anthony intends to vigorously defend against these baseless charges.""

Nov 29 2023,Texas abortion case puts doctors' agency in treating pregnancy complications in the spotlight,STAT,center,https://statnews.com/2023/11/29/texas-abortion-law-hearing-doctor-protection-medical-emergency,"The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday heard a case that could end up deciding whether abortion in the state should be protected under its constitution when it’s provided for medical reasons. Also at stake is the issue of how much agency doctors have to exercise their medical judgment in the treatment of the most complicated pregnancies — a power that the case’s plaintiffs claim has been lost under Texas’ current abortion laws.

The case was brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represents two OB-GYNs and 20 patients who were denied abortions because their doctors weren’t sure they were legally allowed to perform them, even if the doctors thought the procedure was medically appropriate to treat their patients’ serious complications. Some of the plaintiffs denied abortions said they were forced to carry a pregnancy to term only to have a stillbirth, watch their newborn die gasping for air, or wait to go into sepsis so that their condition was severe enough that the abortion was warranted.

The plaintiffs don’t blame their doctors. Instead, they are suing the state of Texas because they say the law’s wording, which bans abortions after six weeks except in case of “medical emergencies,” is too vague and doesn’t allow doctors to follow their medical judgment freely, leaving pregnant people vulnerable when facing complications that present serious risks to their own health or preclude the survival of the fetus.

The law, the plaintiffs say, does not explain the level of risk that a woman must face in order to be eligible for interventions, nor what kinds of fetal abnormalities incompatible with life might constitute an emergency. They argue this vagueness may leave doctors afraid to administer a medically necessary abortion for fear of legal consequences. Doctors who perform abortions considered unlawful in Texas face up to 99 years in jail and up to a $100,000 fine, as well as revocation of their medical license.

There’s no way to make the law sufficiently specific, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which said in August 2022 that “there is no one-size-fits-all law that can take every individual, family, or medical condition into account.”

“That’s why it’s so important for doctors to be able to exercise their medical judgment in order to decide with their patients, when there’s an abortion necessary to preserve their health,” said Astrid Ackerman, a staff attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The state of Texas says the law does not deprive the doctors of the freedom to use their medical judgment, and says there is no reason for doctors to fear prosecution if they do so. “So long as the judgment is reasonable you should be fine under this law,” Texas Assistant Attorney General Beth Klusmann said during Tuesday’s hearing. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office did not respond to STAT’s request for comment.

While discussing the kinds of medical situations faced by the case’s plaintiffs, Klusmann said that cases in which the fetus would not have been able to sustain life after birth would not qualify as medical emergencies, as the health of the mother is not at risk. On the other hand, if the mother’s water broke prematurely and the fetus would not survive, that would qualify as an emergency.

After the case was brought before a lower court earlier this year, the judge issued an injunction in August, saying that doctors can’t face prosecution for providing required abortion care. The state of Texas, however, stayed the injunction, and the Texas Supreme Court is now tasked with deciding both on procedural matters — whether the women who were denied the abortions have the standing to bring on the suit as they no longer are pregnant, and whether Texas has sovereign immunity — and on the merit of the law.

The court doesn’t have to issue a decision on the latter question; it could simply limit its opinion to the procedural element of the case. But the court could uphold the lower court’s decision and say that doctors are legally protected when they exercise their best medical judgment or go even further, as the Center for Reproductive Rights is asking, and establish that the Texas constitution protects the right to receive abortion as necessary health care.

This is a right protected under the constitution of several states, including ones, such as North Dakota, that have otherwise restrictive abortion laws. “Texas in some ways is behind. And should follow what these other courts have done, which is to recognize that these types of restrictions are not working on the ground but also a violation of constitutional rights,” said Ackerman.

The judges’ decision could also be consequential for broader abortion access in the U.S., since the Center for Reproductive Rights has filed similar lawsuits in Idaho and Tennessee. “The Texas Supreme Court can be a very influential court for other state courts and there’s still some other states that have not recognized the damage that these laws have created,” said Ackermann.

If the court does not make a decision on the merit of the law but decides that the plaintiffs have standing to bring on the suit, the trial could go back through the lower courts, with the possibility that appeals of the decision — whatever it may be — mean that the case eventually ends up again at the state Supreme Court. Should the court decide the plaintiffs don’t have standing, the case would be dismissed and the injunction no longer applicable."

Nov 09 2023,The Downballot: Abortion powers Democrats to huge election night (transcript),Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/11/9/2204665/-The-Downballot-Abortion-powers-Democrats-to-huge-election-night-transcript,"Just one word explains why Democrats had such a massive election night on Tuesday: abortion. On the newest episode of The Downballot, co-hosts David Nir and David Beard recap all the top races through the lens of reproductive rights, which continue to motivate Democrats and even win over a key swath of Republican voters. Nowhere was that more evident than in Ohio, which voted to enshrine the right to an abortion into the state constitution by a double-digit margin, despite countless GOP attempts to derail the effort.

Abortion also played a key role in Kentucky, where Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won another term by making his Republican opponent answer for his total opposition to the procedure despite the state's deep-red hue. It was central as well in Virginia, where Democrats won complete control of the legislature after GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin dared them to oppose his proposed 15-week ban. And it came up again and again in swingy Pennsylvania, which saw Democrat Dan McCaffery win a key seat on the state Supreme Court over a far-right opponent. Plus: How the suburbs continue to slip away from the GOP's grasp.

David Beard: Hello and welcome. I'm David Beard, contributing editor for Daily Kos Elections.

David Nir: And I'm David Nir, Political Director of Daily Kos. “The Downballot” is a weekly podcast dedicated to the many elections that take place below the presidency, from Senate to City Council. Please subscribe to “The Downballot” on Apple Podcasts and leave us a five-star rating and review.

Beard: Wow. Well, we've got quite a show today, don't we?

Nir: We have so much to talk about. Let's get right to it. Beard, oh my God. Tuesday night. Holy crap. That was incredible. How many times are we going to kick off this show by saying that, but that was just beyond “beyond?”

Beard: I know, I know. Knock on wood, it's going to keep happening. I don't want to lose this feeling, but it was another great night. We've had a number of them in a row. Hopefully, they will keep going, where Democrats won a number of key races and had some real successes across the country.

Nir: It was truly incredible to watch. And I have to say, as a Democrat, as a progressive, as someone who's been in this business a long time, it felt absolutely amazing and the extent, the breadth, of Democratic successes up and down the ballot across the country, that was pretty remarkable. But I have to say, it wasn't a surprise. And the reason why it wasn't a surprise, to me at least, is because we've been paying attention, very close attention, to the overall political environment, including the special elections. And I was only kidding around just a little bit at the start of this show. We have had so much good news this year, so if you've been paying attention, Tuesday night really should not have been a total shocker.

Beard: Yeah, there's been a big incongruity between the actual election results that we've seen throughout the year, and particularly, obviously special elections results that we've been tracking, that have consistently shown a good atmosphere for Democrats across the country, versus this national polling that we've seen. Obviously, most recently, this very bad poll came out talking about next year, which gives Democrats this doom and gloom feeling that everything is going terribly. And obviously, elections don't happen every day. And particularly unless you're really paying attention, you won't notice all of the elections that happen throughout the year. Maybe you only notice the ones in your area, and then in November you sort of hear in your newspaper or wherever about the results. And so if you don't regularly intake actual election results, you think things are going terribly for Democrats because of these news headlines and these polls that come out. But there's no evidence of it from actual election results that we have been getting throughout the year.

Nir: Yeah. Unlike polls taken a year before an election, which historically have very little predictive value, special elections, as our own analysis has shown, particularly by our colleague Daniel Donner, have a lot of predictive power, particularly when it comes to explaining what's likely to happen in upcoming elections for the US House in the next November election. And these special elections also have predictive power even when you only have one year's worth of data. We're now halfway into the '23-'24 cycle, and these numbers are telling us a lot. And we know this because if you look at half cycles worth of data in past election years, they also have a lot of predictive value.

I think, at least I'd like to think, that the kinds of analysis that we at Daily Kos Elections have been doing since 2017 about special elections, I think it's really changed the narrative and changed the way that a lot of people look at elections. We've seen folks, particularly folks like Aaron Blake and Philip Bump at the Washington Post, whose work I respect a great deal, really take this stuff seriously and really use it to interpret the overall political environment.

But it's gotten to a point where I think people are taking this stuff seriously, that Jonathan Chait at New York magazine actually published a piece on Wednesday morning, the day after the election, with the headline “The Special Elections Tell Us Nothing About 2024.” That's not true. That's not true. But the fact that he even felt the need to publish this totally reactionary piece, trying to poo-poo the special elections, very ineffectively I might add — but the fact that he felt compelled to do so, to me, says, “Wow, okay. This analytical tool has really had an impact and has taken hold among the broader political community,” which I think is awesome.

Beard: Yeah, and I think it also totally misses the point, insofar as the special elections tracker and the analysis that we've done, and that other folks have done, shows that it tracks the House result for next year, not necessarily the presidential race. Now, given increasing polarization, I would be really surprised if there was a big difference in outcome between the House result next year and the presidential race next year. But, again, this problem that we see and why you started the Swing State Project all those years ago, why we do “The Downballot” now, is that everyone's obsessed with the presidential race and Biden. So of course, Chait compares the special election results to Biden, which is not what anyone is claiming, and instead fails to compare them to what we are claiming around the House vote.

But the point remains that special elections do have good evidence behind them in a way that polling the year before really does not. That doesn't mean you obviously completely ignore polling. There can be some valuable information that you can glean from them a year ahead. Particularly people who are looking to conduct the campaign might want to know how to conduct the campaign next year. But you're not going to take it and be like, ""Oh, well, here's the result from October 2023. That must be how November 2024 is going to go.""

Nir: Yeah. Yair Rosenberg at The Atlantic, who is one of my favorite people on Twitter, he tweeted, ""Breaking. Polls show that if the 2024 election were held tomorrow, something completely unconstitutional will have happened.""

Beard: Exactly.

Nir: I mean, yeah, polls definitely have value a year out, but like you say, not for predictive purposes, but to tell you about the issues that people care about and how you might conduct your campaign accordingly. And I don't want to get too deep into the presidential race. After all, this is “The Downballot” podcast, but it's also been a super weird presidential race. It's been entirely focused on Biden with this weird fake GOP primary. And Trump really hasn't been centered in the race yet. And that's going to change things in one way or another.

Whereas with the elections that actually took place on Tuesday night, and all the special elections that have taken place this year, not just the special races, like the Wisconsin Supreme Court election; those involve actual candidates and actual races that have been actually fought on the campaign trail. And voters know what they're getting and they've been exposed to these messages. And so they just take the temperature of the electorate so much better than a poll a year out from an election can.

Beard: And these are key presidential states where we've been seeing these good results in 2023. Obviously, as you mentioned, Wisconsin this past spring, and Pennsylvania just on Tuesday, have shown really good results in states where the presidential race will be decided next year.

One other point I want to make that's a little bit about the presidential, but it's more about campaigns in general, which is we've often seen these polls in red states where you see these really competitive races where both candidates are like 42. The Republican's at 42, and the Democrat's at 42, and you're like, ""Oh, maybe this could be a race. Maybe the Democrat could pull it off in a red state."" And when you dig into those polls, often what you see are voters that you think of as regular hardcore Republican voters are unhappy with their candidate and so aren't indicating support for that candidate in those polls. And then inevitably, as you get closer to Election Day and then on Election Day itself, those voters come home, reluctantly or not; maybe they've been persuaded during the course of the campaign. They end up voting for the Republican candidate, as you would expect.

And what we've been seeing with a lot of these polls is a lot of unhappy traditionally Democratic voters, be they young voters or voters of color, who aren't very happy with Biden or with Democrats in general, but they've been voting Democrat in 2023 when actually faced with elections. And my expectation is that most of those voters are going to come home during the course of the election next year, as we often see in so many elections up and down the ballot. People tend to come home if they're traditionally Democratic or traditionally a Republican voter.

Nir: That's an excellent point. And I will say that last year, I feel like my biggest analytical mistake was assuming that those unhappy, undecided Republican-leaning voters were going to come home for Republicans because that is usually what happens. And so you would see those polls, 47-47 tie in a red or swing state, and you figure, ""Oh man, the Republican is going to win 52-48 in the end."" And in a lot of cases that didn't happen, which was what made 2022 so interesting a race. And man, if that happens again, while at the same time, modestly disaffected Democrats actually do wind up coming home, we could have another really rough election for Republicans on our hands just like we did on Tuesday night. So I think it's high time we get down to diving into some of these races.

Beard: Yes, absolutely.

Nir: So undoubtedly, the theme of the night has to be abortion. We've been talking about it all year. We've been talking about it since last year since Dobbs, and it's been a huge factor in special elections all over the place, like the Wisconsin Supreme Court race. And there's simply no question that that was what happened on Tuesday night as well.

Beard: Yeah. Obviously, Ohio is the biggest case, and we're going to start talking about that, but this was an issue that was key in almost all of the top statewide races across the country and in a lot of the state legislative races as well.

Nir: Yeah, Ohio is the obvious, obvious place to start. Issue 1, of course, was the constitutional amendment put on the ballot by voters to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, and that won in a freaking landslide. It won 57-43, almost identical to the margin that voters rejected the previous issue on, the August GOP-backed amendment that would've made it harder to amend the state constitution. That was also 57-43.

And Republicans tried everything they possibly could to prevent this issue from even appearing on the ballot. They tried to prevent it from passing even if it did get on the ballot. And there was just no stopping this. Ohio is a red state that voted for Trump by eight or nine points, and yet it voted to protect abortion rights and also contraceptive rights, and also the right to fertility care, in the state constitution, by a double-digit margin.

And Republicans, there's just nothing they can do about this. In 2019, three years before Dobbs, they passed a six-week abortion ban in the state. It was revived after Dobbs was handed down. Then it was put on hold by a state court judge. The case was making its way through the state courts. Really good chance that the far-right state Supreme Court would green light that six-week abortion ban at some point. And now they can't. It's just done. It is written in the state constitution that the state cannot interfere with the right to an abortion before viability. In other words, a framework very much like what we had under Roe. And that's it. That's the end of the story. We win.

Beard: Yeah. First off, I just want to say to Mike DeWine, the governor of Ohio: you don't have to worry about trying to pass those pesky exceptions that you promised the Republican legislature was somehow going to take up. If only voters voted down this pro-reproductive rights amendment, you would get those little exceptions passed in the Republican legislature, even though they didn't want to. Well, you don't have to worry about that anymore. That's been taken off your hands. You can go back to other issues.

I'll also say I did see a comment from one of the GOP state legislative leaders who said, ""Well, this is just the start of amendment after amendment about abortion going on the ballot as they seek to repeal or change this amendment."" I'm just like, ""Good luck with that."" When you lose on an issue by more than 10 points in a very competitive state like Ohio, the odds that this is suddenly going to turn around for you in just a couple of years seems pretty low to me. But they're more than welcome to put more reproductive rights amendments onto the ballot so that we can vote them down and turn out our voters.

Nir: Beard, I absolutely love this idea. We should offer some pro bono consulting to the Ohio Republican Party.

Beard: Yes.

Nir: Here's how you screw yourself. Sorry, we didn't mean to say that part out loud.

Beard: Yeah. Every year repealing. Issue 1 goes on the ballot, everyone goes to vote on it, it loses. We elect maybe some Democrats; everybody wins.

Nir: This sounds fantastic. I saw some tweet on Tuesday night where some Ohio Republican was claiming, they're actually glad that Issue 1 is done with. Because now they don't have to contend with it on the ballot for 2024 when they have all kinds of other races on the ballot, including, of course, the all-important Senate race with Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown seeking reelection. The excuse-making, the copium: it's all just, just amazing.

And here's the other thing though. There are going to be other issues on the ballot that are going to motivate Democrats. But not just Democrats, also civic-minded Republican voters; particularly, redistricting reform is almost certainly going to be on the ballot in Ohio. And also a minimum wage increase.

And abortion is going to be really top of mind. I mean, assuming the presidential race, Biden versus Trump, that's a really, really clear divide between the parties. Trump still keeps bragging about how his finest achievement was adding justices to the Supreme Court who destroyed Roe v. Wade. So yeah, you're not getting away from this, dudes.

Beard: Yeah, Sherrod Brown is absolutely going to be campaigning on abortion and telling voters in Ohio that, ""If you send a Republican in my place and you vote for Donald Trump, there's a very good chance you could get a nationwide limitation on abortion next year."" And that's going to be a real threat that Republicans are going to have to deal with because voters are going to be like, ""Oh, I don't want that. So maybe I should vote for Democrats this year, even if I don't agree with them on everything. Because I really don't want to see a nationwide abortion ban passed. And so we've got to make sure Democrats control enough of Washington to make sure that that doesn't happen."" So this issue is not going to disappear even from a state like Ohio that now has constitutional protections.

Nir: Now, I don't think Sherrod Brown is going to win 57-43.

Beard: If only.

Nir: If only. I got to believe that the folks who create the voter files, in other words, the databases that campaigns use to try to figure out who their supporters are, now I have a really interesting new layer of data to add to their files, which is how people voted on Issue 1. And so you are going to have a number of Republican voters throughout the state who the voter file creators at least have good reason to believe, probably voted in favor of Issue 1. Obviously, the secret ballot is sacrosanct. So these are just best guesses.

And so to my mind, that suggests to me that there's a whole new set of data about a universe of voters that Sherrod Brown can reach out to that maybe we didn't know as much about before, these pro-choice Republican voters. And it's not like Republicans benefited in any way. It's not like their voter files are identifying new swaths of voters who might find the GOP message appealing. So I like this for Sherrod Brown.

Beard: Yeah. And to tackle it first on a micro level, and then I also want to talk about it on a macro level. There are always things that crack people open to being more willing to vote for the other side. Most voters in America go into the ballot box, they vote for the Republican, they vote for the Democrat, even if they don't like parts of what their own party is doing. People can be very unhappy with their own party and still just go in and check all the Democratic boxes, or check all the Republican boxes.

But eventually, for some people, something will cause them to vote for something opposite their party, be that a referendum, be that a controversial candidate. Something to make them think, ""I'm not going to vote the way I'm supposed to vote as a quote, unquote 'Republican voter.' I'm going to vote in this case for Issue 1. I'm going to vote to protect abortion rights and maybe also I'm going to vote for marijuana legalization."" Even though maybe they care a lot about tax cuts or something, whatever generally makes them a Republican.

And what that does, obviously you're not going to get 100% of those voters. But some of them are going to be more open to being like, ""Well, I've already voted against what the Republicans wanted once. Maybe I do think Sherrod Brown is the most important person to protect abortion rights, and so I need to vote for him next year."" And maybe you get 20% of those voters who used to always vote Republican who started voting for these pro-reproductive rights amendments, who voted for marijuana legalization, were like, ""You know what? I need to vote for Sherrod Brown. This is too important. I'll vote for my Republicans downballot."" And then over time, those people start voting for Democrats more and more.

And we've seen that happen. In the South, obviously over the latter half of the 20th century, we saw folks starting to vote for Republicans at the presidential level, these white Southerners. And then down the ballot it trickled, more and more votes for Republicans.

Over many years we've seen that in suburban areas and various states where something cracks them open. And then just election after election, it becomes a little bit more Democratic as more suburban voters start being willing to vote for Democrats. And that's something you could see here. I think some of these voters who have been voting for these pro-reproductive rights issues are going to be like, ""Maybe I need to vote for Sherrod Brown next year.""

Nir: Well, we definitely saw that phenomenon play out in the Kentucky governor's race, which was another amazing result. Democratic Governor Andy Beshear defeated his Republican opponent, Daniel Cameron, by five points, four years after Beshear pulled off a remarkable upset by just a few thousand votes against Republican Matt Bevin.

And when Beshear started running ads on abortion in Kentucky, that just blew my mind. And that said to me, ""Whoa, this issue is hitting differently than any other issue. Because no Democrat running for statewide office in Kentucky, probably in most parts of Kentucky, would ever want to even say the word abortion, get anywhere near the issue."" But Cameron's views are so extreme, supported the state's near-total ban on abortion that Beshear realized that he had an opening there. And he ran ads, a really heartrending ad featuring a young woman who said she had been raped and talking about the state's lack of an exception for victims like her should they become pregnant as a result of a rape. Beshear even thanked that woman in his victory speech on Tuesday night.

And he made Cameron squirm. I mean, Cameron really was uncomfortable. And he even started to say, ""Oh, if the legislature would pass certain exceptions he would sign them."" As if Kentucky Republicans are ever going to do that. The Kentucky legislature could keep up with the Ohio legislature to pass all these loosenings of their abortion ban.

Beard: Yeah, any day now. Any day now.

Nir: I mean, they still can just because they lost right? Now's the time to prove, right?

Beard: Yeah. I mean, if the Kentucky legislature wants to send Andy Beshear some legislation to enshrine these protections into Kentucky law, I'm sure he would sign them. So go for it.

Nir: Please do. And I think part of the reason why Beshear knew that this could be a winning issue for him is that you'll recall, I'm sure many of our listeners remember that last year abortion was also on the ballot in Kentucky. The legislature had put an amendment on the ballot saying that state judges could not rule that the state constitution guaranteed any right to an abortion. Now, no state court had ever ruled in that way. Some other states have, but not in Kentucky. But Republicans were freaked out about the possibility that maybe one day the Kentucky Supreme Court would say, ""Oh, the state constitution protects a certain right to an abortion."" And so they put this amendment on the ballot and it lost.

It lost by actually a pretty similar margin to what Beshear won by. I think it lost by about four points. Beshear won by five points. And so even in deep red Kentucky, you have these pro-choice Republican voters who obviously were absolutely critical to Beshear's victory. And man, I mean, if you're a Republican in Kentucky and you can't run on abortion free and clear, where can you?

Beard: Yeah. And to take it back to a pre-Dobbs atmosphere, a lot of Southern Democrats, not only were they anti-abortion, but they didn't even want to talk about being anti-abortion. Because even raising the issue of reproductive rights was a loser for them. Because it would raise the salience, make people think about it, and make people vote for Republicans, even if you were trying to say that you were on their side on the issue.

Nir: Because they were associating Democrats with being pro-choice, even if you were claiming you were not.

Beard: Yes. Just by raising the salience of the issue even if you were trying to agree with these voters, was a net negative for you. So all you would do is focus on economic issues. You had your defensive answer if it was like a debate or if somebody asked, but you never brought it up, you never had an ad about it, anything like that. And now obviously to see how much things have shifted with this advertising campaign that Beshear ran, is just crazy.

And I think so much of it is because Republicans allowed themselves to get so extreme on the issue of abortion. Because they were protected by Roe for so many decades that they could introduce fetal personhood amendments, or whatever else they called it, that would basically ban abortion completely. And there was never really any pushback to them because everyone was like, ""Oh, well, Roe is the law of the land."" Then introducing these crazy bills, they didn't matter. It doesn't mean anything.

And now people are living in that reality in a lot of states. And so when Republicans have this and when you can put on these ads to say, ""Hey, I'm somebody who would fit this exception, and now I couldn't get an abortion if I needed one."" That really affects people in a way that it just never did before Dobbs. And it sucks as we've talked about, that it had to happen for people to take it seriously, and that people didn't take it seriously in 2016. But that's the reality of where we are.

And obviously, Andy Beshear used it to great effect to win such an impressive victory after such a narrow margin, as you mentioned, to win this comfortably against a good candidate. Obviously, Cameron had his problems, but he was well-liked both by the McConnell wing and the Trump wing.

Beard: He was well-liked both by the McConnell wing and the Trump wing. So it's just such an impressive win by Andy Beshear and great for Kentucky that he'll be the governor for the next four years.

Nir: So Republicans have been scrambling to try to find some other way to talk about abortion, to deal with abortion because they can't give up on abortion. Obviously, it's never going to happen. But we saw that even if you try to come up with some new look approach to all of this in Virginia, it still just didn't work. Democrats had a huge election night in Virginia. They held the state Senate. They're going to have a 21-19 majority there. That's actually down one seat, but it's a very solid 21 seats. They also flipped the state House. They won exactly the three seats that they needed. They are currently leading 51-48. There's one seat that's uncalled where the Republican is ahead. So right now, that would wind up at 51-49, and that last seat could potentially change.

There, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin had been pushing his party to embrace his call for a 15-week ban on abortion. The other thing that he did as part of this was he tried to spin it not as a ban, but as a, quote, unquote, ""limit."" He even got some big media outlets to buy into this and put the word limit in their headlines. Like, dude, we're not stupid. If you can get an abortion in 15 weeks, but you can't at 16 weeks, then you're banned from getting an abortion.

Youngkin was convinced that this was going to work. He had some polling that claimed that people were very evenly divided on this. The anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List said that this was a perfect test case, and this is what Republicans ran on and embraced in Virginia, and it was absolutely deadly to them. Democrats were like, ""Yeah, bring it on. Bring it on,"" and it was Democrats who brung it.

Beard: Yeah, this was a great test case for this claim and it was an utter failure. So if they want to test it again, of course, by all means. But what I would take from it from their side is this doesn't work any better than any of the rest of the things that they've tested in other states. I saw a great comparison on X — Twitter, whatever we want to call it — which is that it's a similar issue now for Republicans as gun control is for Democrats in that you can take a poll and you can message it to where you get 90 plus support for certain gun restrictions, background checks, other things. Then when you go and you actually run a campaign, you can talk about those things that have 90 plus support. But then people who really care about this issue will be like, ""Well, yeah, I support that, but I don't trust you to just do that. I think you're going to take my guns,"" is the problem that Democrats keep facing with that issue.

It's like, ""Even though I support those very specific issues that you say you're running on, I don't trust you as a party to do just that because I think you're going to take my guns."" Now for the flip side, what you have is no matter what Republicans say, ""Oh, we just want to limit abortion a little bit,"" they try to say, and voters are going to say, ""Well, maybe I wouldn't mind that, but I don't trust you to stop there. I don't trust you as a Republican Party to just pass this 15-week ban and stop there. So I'm going to still vote for the Democrats because I want to make sure abortion rights are protected. I know they will do that. I believe that Democrats really care about this and will protect this, and I believe that you care about banning it. Even if you say you're going to do this more limited law, I know you still want to ban abortion, so I'm not going to vote for you.""

Nir: I think that is such a great point. I also think it goes even further than that because a lot of issue-based polling isn't really well suited to capturing the intensity of preference that people feel. With the gun safety issues, like you were mentioning, most Americans are very much in favor of most smart gun-safety laws, but those who are opposed are really, really intense about it. They get super fired up, and they're the ones who are turning into super volunteers and donors and showing up in low-turnout elections. We saw this a decade ago in particular. Beard, do you remember those Colorado recalls-

Beard: Yes.

Nir: ... of a couple of Democratic legislators in reasonably blue districts in Colorado, and they were recalled by gun advocates and Democrats supported pretty normal laws. But the pro-gun fanatics were so crazy about it that they showed up for these oddly-timed recall elections and recalled these two sitting state legislators who were Democrats.

I feel like abortion is turning into that issue for us in that it generates incredible passion, particularly among women voters, younger voters, many segments of the Democratic coalition, and also I think a segment of voters who had not previously been part of our coalition, those more moderate Republican voters that we were talking about earlier. So, yeah, of course, the hardcore anti-abortion folks are also really, really worked up. But I think that Republicans are just simply unused to this level of intensity coming from the Democratic side. So you get a poll like a Youngkin poll, 47% in favor of his 15-week ban, 47% against, and you think, ""Oh, people are evenly divided."" But I think the 47% opposed or whatever it is, I think they have just no understanding of how angry and motivated they are.

Beard: Yeah, I think that's absolutely right. I do want to say one thing about these elections that isn't about abortion. I know it's crazy for us to say something-

Nir: What?

Beard: ... that's not about abortion, and it is important. All the stuff we're saying has been true. But I do think what we've seen is, of course, Virginia is, I think at this point, a very light blue state, less so in non-presidential years a little bit just because of turnout and then pretty reliably blue in presidential years. But I think we've seen the solidification of that edge this year around these suburban areas outside of D.C., the Richmond suburbs. As you said, there are 21 seats in the Virginia state Senate. It's only 21, obviously, one more than you need to have a majority, but it's very solid. These races were all won by, I think, at least 3 or 3-1/2 points. They're all places where you would expect Democrats to generally be the favorite. So I think it solidifies a little bit like this is where Democrats can have that stronghold in Virginia to hopefully keep the state legislature moving forward for the foreseeable future.

Nir: Speaking of that 21-seat majority, Beard, I have to give one shout-out before we move on to the next topic, to Lashrecse Aird, who we talked about a bunch on this show earlier this year. She is the former state legislator who unseated conservative Democratic state Senator Joe Morrissey in a very blue seat earlier this year in the primary. Morrissey was extremely unreliable, totally corrupt, and expressed an openness to supporting an abortion ban with Republicans. Aird is a super solid progressive, totally pro-choice. The fact that she replaced Morrissey means that we won't have this total loose canon schmuck that we can't rely on. I'm not going to say that Democrats will remain perfectly unified on every issue for the next two years. That's just not possible. But I think 21 in the Senate, 51 in the House, we're going to see just how unified they are.

It's going to be such a huge contrast to the U.S. House where Republicans can't do a thing with a five-seat majority. I think Democrats are going to do a lot. No, sorry, there's one more thing I have to mention, which is that Joe Sudbay, who is a frequent guest host here on The Downballot and regular host on SiriusXM Progress, I went on the radio with him late on Tuesday night. He pointed out, he said he felt that Youngkin had been protected for the last two years by the fact that the state House was in Republican hands. So the legislature never put forth any progressive bills, popular progressive bills that he then had to veto. That's about to change. With the legislature being fully in Democratic hands, they are going to put bills on his desk that are going to make him squirm, and I really look forward to that.

Beard: Yeah, and my suspicion is that he'll probably veto them, making himself a worse future candidate in Virginia, but continuing this crazy dream of someday being the Republican presidential nominee.

Nir: Yep.

Beard: Obviously, that's not going to be the case in 2024, but clearly both Youngkin and some sort of cadre of Youngkin lovers across the Republican Party's moneyed class think that Youngkin is going to be like a future Republican presidential nominee, which I think there's no way he would ever get through-

Nir: No.

Beard: ... a primary. If you remember, of course, he only got the nomination because it was a convention in Virginia for the governor nominee in 2021, not a primary. So the idea that he's going to go off and win an Iowa caucus or some other primary in one of these more conservative states is just laughable. But I do think it's going to, unfortunately for Virginia, result in a lot of vetoed progressive legislation over the next two years.

Nir: Well, Democrats will have the chance to flip the Virginia governorship in 2025. Youngkin, of course, is term-limited because Virginia is the only state in the nation that limits its governors to just a single four-year term. But it is time we move on to the next big state, and that, of course, is the jumbo swing state of Pennsylvania.

Beard: Yes, Pennsylvania, where once again, abortion was a major factor in the biggest race of the night, Democrat Dan McCaffery won a vacant state Supreme Court seat 53-47. That restores the Democrats’ 5-2 majority that they had lost when one of the members had passed away, resulting in a temporary 4-2 majority. Had we lost this race, obviously it would've gone to 4-3, still a Democratic majority, but a lot more vulnerable. We'd also seen one of the Democratic judges side with the Republicans on a couple of mail ballot decisions. So having a 5-2 majority really stabilizes that. Of course, like we've seen in other states, abortion was one of the key issues that came up in this race around the Supreme Court ruling on that.

Nir: Yeah, the Republican, Carolyn Carluccio, she was super, super anti-abortion in the primary. She talked on her website about protecting all life, and she just had no answer for questions about abortion. On Tuesday night, a reporter asked her about the role that abortion had played in the race, and she said it played, quote, ""way too much of a role."" Well, dude, you could have taken it off the table, but of course, she was incapable. We talked about this on the show recently, but she's running for state Supreme Court, and that's a position that I think most voters take pretty seriously. They want someone even-keeled and even-handed, and Carluccio really came off as looking anything but that.

Beard, you were talking about some of the recent election law cases that the state Supreme Court has handled. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court played a really big role in just putting a dead stop to Trump's scheme to steal the state's electoral votes. And in the Trump indictments, Pennsylvania's mentioned all over the place, it was central to his attempt to subvert the election and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court simply said no. Carluccio, the Republican, was definitely very sympathetic to Trump's point of view about the election having been stolen. She said recently in an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer that she had ""no idea who had won the 2020 presidential election."" I mean, like get the fuck out of here, and this is who could have been on the court and thankfully that's not going to happen. And I think any Republican fantasies of succeeding on the legal level, at least in Pennsylvania, where they failed in 2020, are just absolutely dead in the water at this point.

Beard: Yeah, and this race reminded me more of any other on Tuesday of last year's election races where Republicans so often either nominated a crazy person, or they nominated a candidate that had to swerve so far into the crazy lane to get nominated that it was essentially the same result where everyone was like, ""Oh, you seem kind of crazy by the end of it."" Because Carluccio was the more moderate ""candidate"" because there was a real crazy in the primary that she had to beat, which is why-

Nir: And yet.

Beard: And yet. I know. I know. ""Moderate."" You can't see my air quotes over the podcast I know, but trust me, they're there. So she swerved into this crazy lane so that she could win the nomination and get to the general election. But of course, it's easier said than done to then just try to present yourself as this sort of establishment moderate Republican after you've said all those things. And also you sort of learned how to do the crazy campaigning.

We see these Republicans make these errors during the general election, I think because they get so used to campaigning around a lot of these very hardcore Republican voters, and so they just say things they think are normal responses about Biden not winning the election, and then everybody else is like, ""What?"" Are you in reality?"" And they're like, ""Oh-""

Nir: Yeah, right.

Beard: ""... Oh, right, I'm not with team crazy anymore. I have to present a different front to everybody else."" And by then it's too late.

Nir: That's so perfect. The candidate in a way that she reminds me the most of was actually a 2023 candidate Dan Kelly in Wisconsin in the Supreme Court race there. He was even more extreme than Carluccio, but I think you're absolutely right. They get so deeply embedded in their own Fox News bubble or these days it's the Newsmax bubble and they just can't talk to normal people anymore. Yeah, Republicans for the most part did okay with candidate recruitment in this odd-numbered year, but also there are so many fewer races. I mean, there were still a ton of races, but there are so many fewer candidates, and I think we're going to get right back in 2024 to seeing the nut bars rule the roost because I think they got maybe a little bit lucky in the odd year.

Beard: Yeah, yeah. No, I think there will be plenty of crazies for us to talk about next year once we have races all across the country again.

Nir: Pennsylvania also had a lot of downballot races at the county level for some really important offices. In particular, these county commissions in Pennsylvania are generally responsible for running many aspects of elections, including whether or not to offer drop boxes and how many and where to place them. As a result of a number of these Democratic victories throughout counties in Pennsylvania, voting is simply going to be easier in 2024 and that can make a big difference in close races, whether we're talking about at the presidential level, the Senate race, of course, Bob Casey running for reelection, or a number of races for the US House and the state legislature as well, where half of the state Senate is up and the full House is going to be up. But there's one county in particular that we need to highlight, and that's Dauphin County, which is where the capital of Harrisburg is located.

Democrats took a majority on the county Board of Commissioners for the first time in history on Tuesday night. This had never happened before. And not only that, this county is in a potentially competitive congressional district, the 10th district, which is represented by Republican Scott Perry, who's one of the top insurrectionists in Congress. He's almost certainly going to face a difficult reelection next year. This is great news because it just means there's probably going to be higher turnout than there otherwise would've been in Dauphin County, and we can be sure that the folks who are going to be responsible for running the election are going to do so fairly and make it as accessible as possible.

Beard: This is a district for a number of years that's sort of been right on the edge of competitiveness, inching towards Democrats, but never really becoming the top tier. I think obviously this election result is a great sign for future Democratic performance, but also, like you said, making sure that people have every opportunity to vote next year and what will hopefully be a competitive race to try to take down Scott Perry.

Nir: Now, it wasn't a perfect election night. I mean, come on. There's no such thing. It's too big of a country, there are way too many races and some of them are going to be on inhospitable turf for Democrats no matter what. The highest profile place where Democrats came up short was the Mississippi Governor's race, where Republican governor Tate Reeves defeated Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley by a 52-47 margin. But we’ve got to remember, this is freaking Mississippi here. This was a five-point race. Republicans seriously sweated it. They put in a lot of money.

Now, Democrats certainly did as well, but man, I mean, if you're having to fight really hard to protect Mississippi, and if you're going to election night not being sure whether you're actually going to win or whether there might be a runoff, I don't want to find myself in that position. That would suck. I mean, you know what that felt maybe a little bit like the New York Governor's race in 2022. It was like, I don't really think Lee Zeldin is going to win, but I hate having to worry about that. That's where Republicans were, I think with Mississippi on Tuesday night.

Beard: I think Tate Reeves might've been constructed in a laboratory to see if they could create the Republican so bad while still getting 51% of the vote in Mississippi because he's so awful, but the state is just so inelastic. There are just so many people who are going to vote for Republicans no matter what, that he can just be so bad and still get 51% of the vote, which I'm sure is extremely frustrating, obviously, for the many Democrats in Mississippi, but I don't think is very reflective of broader trends like the rest of the night was.

The reality is it's just so hard for Democrats to get from that mid-forties position to 50% of the vote in Mississippi. The voting is so racially polarized that the hill is so much higher to climb than a state like — New Hampshire is obviously the classic, very elastic state where there are just a ton of voters who are swing voters who are willing to vote for Democrats or Republicans depending on the candidate or the year and all of that. And the vast majority of voters in Mississippi, they just go tick the Republican box or the Democratic box, and it's so, so hard to get there. Reeves did everything he could to help get Democrats there, but we still didn't get there even with every scandal in the world.

Nir: That has to be the most disgusting laboratory in the world.

Beard: Yeah, I wouldn't want to visit it.

Nir: Oh God. Well, it's high time that we wrap up, but I think there's one other theme to the night that we have to discuss before we sign off.

Beard: Yeah, and we've touched on this a little bit — but I think it's really important, particularly as we've looked in the past few years of politics in America, and as we look to 2024 — and that's the continued evolution of suburbia really across the country. We've seen that suburban areas are in different places along this path in different parts. In some states, suburban areas are very reliably blue at this point. In some states, suburban areas are still fairly red and just starting to inch their way toward Democrats, but the trend is just so consistent all across the country.

You can see that Beshear improved his margins the most in suburban Louisville and in suburban Cincinnati. In these three counties in northern Kentucky that border Cincinnati, Beshear made some real improvements there. We saw a lot of really good results in Ohio in these suburban counties around Columbus and around Cincinnati that are traditionally pretty red, that still voted to enshrine abortion rights in the Constitution and voted for marijuana legalization. We saw, as I mentioned, in Virginia, these suburban areas of Washington DC, of Richmond, really helped solidify a small but durable Democratic majority. In Pennsylvania, we saw Democrats do really well at the local level in these southeastern Pennsylvania counties around Philadelphia. We saw them do well across the suburbs in that Supreme Court race. And I think this is a trend that's pretty durable at this point, and we should expect to see continue into 2024 with democratic strength in the suburbs.

Nir: Yeah, there's one particularly interesting suburban county that's more in the outer reaches of the suburbs in the eastern part of the state, and that's Berks County, B-E-R-K-S. Not to be confused with Bucks County. Berks County had really remained Republican for a long time, even though it is fairly suburban. Trump won it by eight points in 2020, but McCaffrey won it by two points on Tuesday night. That's a 10-point swing, and it at least is a sign that maybe Democratic fortunes are improving ever further out into the Pennsylvania suburbs. If that's so, that is going to pose a huge problem for Republicans because they pretty much have to win back Pennsylvania in order to win the White House in 2024. I mean, maybe there are other paths, but if not Pennsylvania, then states very much like Pennsylvania and areas very much like the kind that we're talking about. If these are actually, Beard, like you were saying, durable changes, then they have a serious problem.

Beard: Yeah, and we saw throughout particularly the latter years of the Obama presidency, rural areas just like going away from Democrats, and it just kept happening and everyone kept wanting to do something about it, but these trends are sometimes not so easy to change. That trend continued, even though in a lot of places we're so far down in rural areas that there's not too much further to go. Those trends of those voters we lost during the Obama era, they haven't come back. What we did was we started gaining suburban voters, and so Republicans are probably going to have to deal with the fact that these suburban voters are by and large not coming back, and they're going to have to look to how they win elections in other ways.

Nir: Once again, they can point to all of the polls that they want, but election results are a different beast entirely, and there is simply no arguing with the fact that Democrats had an exceptional night on Tuesday night.

Dec 13 2023,The Supreme Court will hear its biggest abortion case since it overruled Roe v. Wade,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/12/13/23992173/supreme-court-abortion-ban-mifepristone-danco-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine,"The Supreme Court announced on Wednesday that it will give a full hearing to a long-simmering dispute over whether far-right federal courts may ban the abortion drug mifepristone.

Mifepristone is part of a two-drug treatment that causes the uterus to expel pregnancy tissue. This two-drug regime, which may be taken up to the 70th day of a pregnancy, is often a safer alternative than surgical abortion — and it is also a less invasive procedure. More than half of all US abortions are medication abortions, which use mifepristone.

The Court’s decision to hear two consolidated cases, known as FDA v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine and Danco Laboratories v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, is unsurprising, as it has already weighed in on this case once. And the Court’s previous actions suggest that most of the justices are unlikely to allow a court-imposed mifepristone ban to stand.

But while the Court seems likely to decide that judges shouldn’t be allowed to upend the nationwide availability of a common drug, the fact that these cases are once again before the Court is a reminder of just how broken the federal judiciary is.

In April 2023, federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk — a Trump appointee closely affiliated with the Christian right and a longtime crusader against abortion, birth control, and many forms of human sexuality — attempted to ban mifepristone by suspending its regulatory approval. The Supreme Court halted Kacsmaryk’s order and determined that the medication, which has been legal in the United States since 2000, should remain lawful while this case worked its way through the appellate process.

Nevertheless, Kacsmaryk’s decision was appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a far-right court dominated by MAGA stalwarts, and a panel of that court also voted to heavily restrict mifepristone in August 2023 (though that decision never took effect because of the Supreme Court’s previous intervention in this case).

The Supreme Court is back for a new term. Ian Millhiser is here to explain the stakes. The 2023–2024 SCOTUS term features a growing list of cases that could transform the US, its government, and our right to free speech and public safety. We’re tracking them here. Ian has covered the Supreme Court extensively as a senior correspondent for Vox. Read more of his reporting here.

Technically, the Fifth Circuit’s decision did not ban mifepristone outright — it merely required the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to unravel several changes the FDA made to the protocol health providers must use when prescribing the drug, which rolled out in 2016. As a practical matter, however, requiring health providers to return to pre-2016 protocols would prevent them from prescribing mifepristone for at least several months, because the drug’s manufacturer would need to revise its labels, recertify providers on the new, court-imposed protocol, and take other steps that cannot be completed quickly.

As the conservative Supreme Court’s April order suggests, the legal arguments against mifepristone are exceedingly weak. No federal court, including Kacsmaryk’s court, had jurisdiction to hear this case in the first place. And the law gives the FDA, and not judges, the power to decide which drugs should be available in the US.

It does so, moreover, for a very good reason. The FDA is made up of scientists and other experts in drug safety and efficacy, while the courts are made up of lawyers who rarely know anything about these subjects.

One other sign that the justices probably aren’t going to ban mifepristone is that, at the same time that the Court announced it would hear the two Alliance cases, it also denied a request by the anti-abortion plaintiffs in those cases. Those plaintiffs asked the justices to consider reinstating Kacsmaryk’s sweeping ban on mifepristone. In refusing to even consider that option, the Court effectively takes it off the table — at least for now.

Yet, while the law is clear, the stakes in the Alliance cases are exceedingly high. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (2022), the Court’s decision overruling Roe v. Wade, the five justices in the majority pledged to stay out of national abortion policy — announcing that “it is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.”

The Alliance cases will tell us if that was all a big lie, and if the same justices are willing to rely on the flimsiest of pretexts to ban a medication used in most US abortions.

The plaintiffs’ legal arguments in Alliance are absurdly weak

It’s hard to overstate how clear-cut of a case this should be for defenders of mifepristone. As Adam Unikowsky, a former law clerk to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, wrote in a lengthy takedown of the mifepristone litigation, “If the subject matter of this case were anything other than abortion, the plaintiffs would have no chance of succeeding in the Supreme Court.”

For starters, no federal court should have heard this case in the first place. That’s because the Constitution requires plaintiffs in federal lawsuits to have “standing,” which means that a plaintiff challenging a federal policy must show that they’ve been injured in some way by that policy. And none of the plaintiffs in the Alliance cases are harmed in any legally significant way by the fact that mifepristone has been legal for nearly a quarter of a century.

The Alliance plaintiffs are doctors who oppose abortion, and organizations representing doctors who oppose abortion. They claim that they are injured by the fact that mifepristone is legal because a patient who takes that drug might experience a complication that might require follow-up treatment (serious complications from mifepristone are quite rare).

Rather then returning to their abortion provider for follow-up care, this patient then might seek care instead from one of the plaintiff doctors or a member of one of the plaintiff organizations. That might require that doctor to divert attention from other patients. Or the plaintiff doctor might have to provide care to this patient that the doctor finds morally objectionable.

That’s a whole lot of mights. And it is far too many mights to allow this lawsuit to proceed. The Supreme Court held in Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA (2013) that a plaintiff can sometimes file a federal lawsuit because they fear they will experience some kind of injury in the future, but only if “the threatened injury is certainly impending.” But there is no certainty here, just a long chain of speculative events that could, possibly, lead to some unidentified doctor doing something they find objectionable at some point in the future.

Meanwhile, even if Kacsmaryk or the Fifth Circuit were permitted to hear this lawsuit, they are not permitted to second-guess the FDA’s scientific judgments about which drugs are sufficiently safe and effective to be prescribed in the US.

As the Supreme Court held in FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project (2021), when a federal agency exercises the authority granted to it by Congress — and there’s no question that the FDA has the authority to decide which drugs are safe and effective — “a court may not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.” Rather, the judiciary’s job is simply to determine that the FDA has “reasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision” to authorize a particular drug.

There’s no serious question that the FDA cleared this low bar — which is intentionally set very low because, again, scientists working at the FDA know a whole lot more than judges do about drug safety, and are more likely to make sensible decisions than black-robed lawyers.

When the FDA first approved mifepristone in 2000, it had already been legal in France for 12 years, so the FDA was able to rely on a dozen years of data showing that the two-drug medication abortion protocol, which uses another drug called misoprostol in sequence with mifepristone, effectively terminated pregnancies in at least 95 percent of cases, and that the side effects were typically mild.

Subsequent studies, which the FDA also considered in its 2016 decision to relax restrictions previously imposed on mifepristone, confirmed that the drug is safe and effective. A 2013 report, for example, looked at 87 different studies, which included data from about 45,000 different patients who had medication abortions. It confirmed that the two-drug protocol effectively ends pregnancy in 95 percent of cases, and that serious complications such as vaginal bleeding or infection occurred in only 3 out of 1,000 patients.

This is more than enough evidence to justify the FDA’s decision to approve, and later to relax restrictions, on mifepristone. And the judges who have second-guessed these decisions have done so based on uninformed speculation about what else the FDA could have done to ensure that the drug is safe.

The Fifth Circuit, for example, struck down the FDA’s decision to relax several restrictions on mifepristone at once in 2016 because, while the FDA did consider studies justifying each of these changes, “none of the studies it relied on examined the effect of implementing all those changes together.”

But, again, the law does not require the FDA to conduct, or to get someone else to conduct, a single study that confirms the conclusion that FDA was able to reach by looking at multiple studies in conjunction. All that it requires is that the FDA reasonably considers the case for and against approving a particular drug protocol, and that it reasonably explains why it reached a particular conclusion.

The federal judiciary’s process for filtering out meritless cases is broken

The federal judiciary is a three-tiered system. Most cases are initially filed in a federal district court, where a single trial judge presides over the case and eventually reaches a decision. That decision can then be appealed to an intermediate federal appeals court, where it is normally heard by a panel of three judges.

Parties that lose in a federal court of appeal can then seek review from the Supreme Court, but such review is rarely granted. The Supreme Court typically hears about 60-80 of the over 8,000 cases annually brought by petitioners asking the Court to give their case a full review.

One reason why the justices hear so few cases is that the lower courts are supposed to act as filters, weeding out relatively easy cases where the law decidedly favors one party or the other, and leaving the hardest cases — typically, the ones that are sufficiently difficult that they divide lower court judges — for the nation’s highest Court.

But this system has broken down, and it is particularly broken in Texas’s federal courts. Those courts frequently allow plaintiffs to choose which trial judge will hear their case by filing the lawsuit in a geographic region that has only one federal judge. One hundred percent of all cases filed in Amarillo, Texas, are assigned to Kacsmaryk, for example; a fact that has led legions of religious conservatives to file their cases in Amarillo. Then, once Kacsmaryk gets his hands on these cases, he generally responds with dubiously reasoned opinions attacking abortion, birth control, and LGBTQ people.

After such a litigant obtains a court order from their hand-picked Texas judge, that decision appeals to the Fifth Circuit, with its array of MAGA judges. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit routinely hands down decisions so extreme, even compared to the preferences of the current, GOP-dominated Supreme Court, that a significant percentage of the Court’s merits docket is now consumed by Fifth Circuit decisions seeking to sabotage the Biden administration or implement a Republican policy.

This term, for example, the justices are expected to reverse a Fifth Circuit decision that declared an entire federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, unconstitutional. The Court is expected to reverse the Fifth Circuit’s decision that people subject to domestic violence restraining orders have a constitutional right to own a gun. And the Court appears likely to limit, if not reverse in its entirety, a Fifth Circuit decision that would have destroyed the federal government’s ability to enforce the laws protecting investors from fraud.

When all is said and done, the Supreme Court is also likely to reverse the Fifth Circuit’s decision in the Alliance cases and reaffirm the rule that experts in the FDA, and not black-robed lawyers who know nothing about medicine or biology, should decide which medications may be prescribed in the United States.

But the fact that the federal judiciary’s process for filtering out meritless cases has broken down places an unfortunate burden on the justices themselves, and it places an unconscionable burden on litigants. The makers of mifepristone have now had to deal with the uncertainty and the expense of litigating this completely meritless case for more than a year. They had to do so, moreover, in three different courts — including two separate trips to the Supreme Court.

And the only reason this case wasn’t dismissed months ago is because the plaintiffs were able to hand-pick a judge who appears incapable of distinguishing between what the law actually says, and what a fringe group of religious conservatives wish that it said."
Dec 06 2023,Wisconsin judge rules that 19th century state law doesn't ban abortion,Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/government/courts-law/wisconsin-judge-rules-19th-century-state-law-doesnt-ban-abortion,"Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper on Tuesday determined that an 1849 Wisconsin law does not ban abortion, reaffirming her own ruling from earlier this year.

Schlipper found that the law, which states that ""any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child is guilty of a Class H felony,"" would not apply to ""consensual abortions, but to feticide,"" according to The Hill.

The 1849 law became the subject of legal dispute after the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to abortion set in the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent, raising questions as to the enforcement of the state law. The case will likely reach the state Supreme Court, which has a liberal majority.

Oct 11 2023,Voting begins in Ohio with abortion rights on the line,San Jose Mercury News,left,https://mercurynews.com/2023/10/11/voting-begins-in-ohio-with-abortion-rights-on-the-line,"By Julie Carr Smyth | Associated Press

COLUMBUS, Ohio — In-person voting for a November ballot measure over abortion rights began Wednesday in Ohio, the latest state where voters will decide the issue after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a nationwide right to the procedure last year.

Ohio is the only state to put an abortion rights question before voters this fall, making it a testing ground for messaging ahead of the 2024 elections when it’s expected to be on the ballot in more states and a major factor in races up and down the ballot.

Election officials throughout the state are generally predicting heavier-than-normal turnout for an off-year vote because of the high-profile campaigning over Issue 1, a constitutional amendment that seeks to enshrine abortion rights.

Mary Weiss was among the voters who entered an early voting center in Toledo during the first day of early in-person voting ahead of Election Day on Nov. 7.

“Women should have total control over their own bodies,” said Weiss, who lives in the Toledo suburb of Sylvania. “No one should be making those decisions for us.”

Initial early voting numbers won’t be available from the secretary of state’s office until next week, but absentee ballot requests in Ohio’s three most populous counties — home to about a third of the state’s total population — have been far greater this year than in Ohio’s last off-year election in November 2021.

The voting beginning this week follows a heavy-turnout special election over the summer, when voters defeated an attempt by Republican lawmakers to make it much harder to pass constitutional amendments. Republicans and anti-abortion groups had hoped to pass that measure ahead of the fall vote on abortion rights.

AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal.

Several vote centers visited Wednesday had no lines but a steady trickle of voters. Among them was Jonathan Griffiths from the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek. A Republican, Griffiths said he voted yes on the constitutional amendment to protect abortion rights.

“I’m fairly conservative, but I’m also married and have daughters and granddaughters,” he said. “Women’s body, women’s choice.”

Ohio’s proposed constitutional amendment would give every person “the right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” The effort comes on the heels of a string of victories for abortion rights supporters around the country who have been winning in both Democratic and heavily Republican states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which had legalized abortion nationwide for half a century.

Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and first lady Fran DeWine, who cast votes against Issue 1 in rural Xenia on Wednesday, urged Ohioans to oppose the measure. The governor said it “goes too far for Ohio.”

“If we’re able to defeat this, then I think we can come together as a state and find a place where a majority of Ohioans can, in fact, agree,” he said.

Shari Moore, a retired banker from suburban Toledo who voted against the amendment along with her husband, said it was a decision rooted in their Christian beliefs.

“Abortion is murder,” she said. “It’s a dangerous thing for Ohio and for the whole country.”

Linda Debard, 73, a retired French teacher from Columbus, said she would be voting yes on the amendment “because I believe firmly that it’s nobody’s business but the family’s what decisions you make with women’s health care. No. Keep the government, politicians out of it.”

Supporters’ ads say abortion-related decisions should be kept between a woman and her family, doctor and faith leaders, not regulated by government.

The opposition campaign, Protect Women Ohio, has zeroed in on questions raised by Issue 1’s broad wording, citing legal theories — as yet, untested — that passing the amendment would jeopardize Ohio’s parental consent requirements for minors receiving abortions and other types of medical care.

Opponents also have campaigned heavily on the idea that the amendment would allow abortions to happen in the final stages of pregnancy, despite such procedures being rare and generally involving life-threatening situations. Misinformation has also swirled around the campaign.

Sam Zern, a regional field organizer for Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights and a graduate student at Kent State University, said the organization has seen “an inspiring amount of energy on college campuses” around the state.

Protect Women Ohio spokesperson Amy Natoce said the group has seen strong turnout at its events, including a March for Life last Friday at the state capital. She said it’s placing “a huge emphasis on people getting out and banking their vote before Nov. 7.”

A second question on Ohio’s November ballot asks whether Ohioans want to legalize recreational marijuana. If passed, it would make Ohio the 24th state to legalize cannabis for adult use.

Nov 28 2023,Texas Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Key Abortion Ban Case,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/texas-supreme-court-hears-oral-arguments-in-key-abortion-ban-case-5537287,"The Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that claims the state’s abortion laws are too restrictive.

The Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Nov. 28 in a case that claims the state’s abortion laws are too restrictive and harm women because doctors fearful of losing their licenses refuse to perform the procedure in nearly all circumstances.

The laws in question, adopted after the landmark 2021 U.S. Supreme Court overturning of Roe v. Wade, prohibit and criminalize abortions in all cases except when the mother’s life is in danger under a “medical emergency” exception.

Pro-abortion rights groups have argued that Texas’ abortion bans contain non-medical terminology and conflicting language that make it unclear when doctors are allowed to perform abortions under the laws’ “medical emergency” exception, stoking fear and confusion among doctors.

Physicians who violate the state’s abortion laws face revocation of their state medical licenses, fines of at least $100,000, and up to 99 years in prison, with pro-abortion rights groups arguing that the legal risks combined with the laws’ unclear language deter doctors from performing abortions even in cases where the mother’s life is in danger. Key Arguments During the Nov. 28 oral arguments before the Texas Supreme Court, attorneys on behalf of the State of Texas argued that the “medical emergency” exception is clear and that the plaintiffs’ battle should take place not before the court but at the state legislature to get the laws changed.

State attorney Beth Klusmann argued that the plaintiffs want the high court to effectively overturn the will of Texans as expressed through the legislative process and make it “so that there really will never be a circumstance in which a woman is unable to obtain an abortion.”

Ms. Klusmann argued that the law allows physicians to use their professional judgment to decide when the law allows for an abortion.

Attorney Molly Duane, arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs, called the last two years an “aberration” from a long practice in Texas that allowed physicians “broad discretion” to provide abortions when they deemed it “necessary” to preserve the lives of their patients.

Ms. Duane argued that, even though the law technically has medical exceptions to the bans, “no one knows what it means, and the State won’t tell us.”

Asked by a judge on the high bench why the plaintiffs weren’t seeking a declaration of the abortion laws’ unconstitutionality based on the “vagueness” doctrine, Ms. Duane replied that this would have meant that the entire law could be struck down, which is not the wish or intent of the plaintiffs. Instead, she said they’re seeking additional “clarification” about what the “medical emergency” exception really means.

In closing arguments, Ms. Klusmann contended that the case is really about medical malpractice in specific instances where the plaintiffs—women who said they were denied abortions despite facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications that threatened their health and lives—may have been given inadequate medical treatment by physicians.

“If, as she said, a woman is bleeding or has amniotic fluid running down her legs, the problem is not with the law, it’s with the doctors,” she said. “That woman would clearly qualify for the medical emergency exception, and so if she has to come to court to make that happen, then that is not the state’s fault.”

“What the legislature has done is chosen to value unborn life and prohibit abortion in all circumstances unless that life is going to conflict with the life of the mother,” she said.

“We’re just trying to identify when it’s appropriate to end the life of an unborn child and the legislature has set the bar high but there’s nothing unconstitutional with their decision to do so,” she added.

Arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs, Ms. Duane said that the women don’t want to sue the doctors because they don’t see them as having done anything wrong except following a law that is too vague and overly restrictive.

“As all of our patient plaintiffs have testified to, their doctors didn’t know what to do, their hands were tied by the law,” she said. “The state’s own expert acknowledges that physicians should not be waiting until death is imminent, yet they are, in her words, ‘providing substandard care’ because of the lack of clarity in the law.”

Background A group of five women who say they were denied abortions despite facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications that threatened their health and lives, Following closing arguments, the court adjourned in the case, which is known as Zurawski v. State of Texas.A group of five women who say they were denied abortions despite facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications that threatened their health and lives, sued Texas in March 2023 over the abortion laws.

The women, who are being represented in the case by the Center for Reproductive Rights, were joined in the lawsuit by two Texas obstetrician-gynecologists, while an amended complaint filed in May 2023 added more plaintiffs to the case and asked a state court to grant a temporary injunction to block the abortion bans while the case proceeds.

The state of Texas, meanwhile, called to dismiss the case, arguing that the laws were clear enough about what constitutes a “medical emergency” exception. State attorneys previously said that the lawsuit was brought because the 13 women were not satisfied with the medical care they received. The state argued that what happened to the women was the responsibility of their doctors, not Texas abortion laws.

“The plaintiffs simply do not like Texas’ restrictions on abortion. This court well knows the purpose of this court is not to legislate or to issue advisory opinions. In fact, the Texas Supreme Court has upheld that courts are prohibited from doing so,” Assistant Texas Attorney General Amy Pletscher told the judge in July.

Then, in August 2023, a Texas district judge in August 2023 issued an injunction temporarily blocking the state’s abortion bans and allowing doctors to perform the procedure on women who have what she called “emergent medical conditions.”

Travis County District Court Judge Jessica Mangrum defined “emergent medical conditions” as physical complications or infections that make pregnancy unsafe, exacerbated medical conditions that cannot be treated during pregnancy, and fetal conditions where survival is unlikely after birth.

She also ruled that any state official who seeks to enforce Texas’s abortion bans against a doctor who provides the procedure after the doctor had determined that the pregnant mother has a “physical emergent medical condition” would be exceeding their legal authority.

The state of Texas immediately appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court, blocking the injunction from taking effect."
Nov 08 2023,Ohio's abortion constitutional amendment: Questions in the wake of Issue 1 passage,WKRC 12,center,https://local12.com/news/local/issue-1-abortion-rights-pro-choice-life-doctor-planned-parenthood-ohio-healthcare-laws-gop-democrat-court-roe-wade-abortions-center-christian-virtue-issues-one-ballot-vote-cincinnati-ohio,"CINCINNATI (WKRC) - Despite voters approving Issue 1, the abortion issue is far from settled in Ohio. The constitutional amendment codifies an Ohioan’s right to an abortion, but there are many questions remaining.



The first is timing. When will the constitutional amendment go into effect? That's the easiest and quickest answer, which is 30 days.

The other questions take a little more explanation. Like, what will the new constitutional amendment do?



Abortion up to viability will be legal. A woman's doctor will determine, on a case-by-case basis, viability. They will be able to grant exceptions at any stage of pregnancy to protect the health or life of the mother.

“This is a historic victory for Ohio and for the country,” said Lauren Blauvelt, Executive Director of Planned Parenthood of Ohio, during a virtual press conference Wednesday morning.

Aaron Baer, the president of the Center for Christian Virtue, spoke to Local 12 one-on-one.

“It’s devastating,” he said of the passage of Issue 1. “The realities of abortion are brutal. So, we mourn today. There’s no other way around it.”

Local 12 asked the anti-abortion and abortion rights advocates about the next steps in the wake of the Issue 1 decision.

Like, what will happen to all of the current abortion laws on the books?

“We have had over 31 abortion bans and restrictions passed since 2011,” said Blauvelt. “So, there’s a lot of work to be done to undo those restrictions and ensure that Ohioans get the access to abortion care and reproductive healthcare that they deserve.”

“We’re preparing to fight this out in court, and fight this out in the general assembly to protect as many lives and women as we can,” said Baer. “Things like 24-hour waiting periods, parental consent laws,” he continued. “A woman has the right to see an ultrasound before getting an abortion, things that require abortion clinics to be regulated by the same standards as other surgical centers.”

As the court battles begin, will the state legislature try to enact new laws that restrict abortion?

“We’re prepared for all eventualities and to be in the fight,” said Blauvelt.

“Because of the broad nature of the language of Issue 1,” said Baer, “A lot of those laws are at risk right now, and we’re going to do everything we can right now to protect them.”

Are there other options besides the courts and the legislature to restrict abortion in Ohio?

Local 12 asked Baer, “You’re saying you might try to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot in the future to undo this constitutional amendment?”

He replied, “At some point we’re going to want to do everything we can to protect every life in Ohio. And if that means have another constitutional amendment, that’s what it would be.”

So, where do we stand today regarding abortion in Ohio? Abortion is legal in Ohio up to viability, that's generally 22 weeks, or five months. And along with all the ancillary laws that exist (such as parental consent, etc.) it is where things will stand until the courts determine whether the laws violate the new constitutional amendment.

As previously mentioned, new laws are on the way.

Ohio House Democrats plan to hold a news conference Thursday to introduce the Reproductive Care Act. It will repeal existing abortion statutes and add protections for patients and providers that align with the new constitutional amendment. Republicans in the state legislature have indicated they plan to try to get a measure on the ballot that would repeal Issue 1."

Nov 28 2023,Arkansas AG Rejects Proposed Ballot Language To Enshrine Abortion In State Constitution,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/28/arkansas-ag-rejects-proposed-ballot-language-abortion-state-constitution,"Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin of Arkansas rejected language for a proposed abortion amendment in a letter Tuesday, saying that it was “internally inconsistent” and did not properly define the terms “health” and “access.”

The language for “The Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment” was submitted to Griffin’s office on Nov. 9 by Arkansans for Limited Government, according to the Arkansas Democrat Gazette. Griffin noted in his letter that his decision to reject the proposed language was not influenced by personal feelings on the issue but rather by multiple inconsistencies and unclear language. (RELATED: Swing State Judge Dismisses ‘Misleading’ Bid To Make Abortion A Constitutional Right)

“Having reviewed the text of your proposed constitutional amendment, as well as your proposed popular name and ballot title, I must reject your popular name and ballot title due to ambiguities in the text of your proposed measure that prevent me from ensuring that the ballot title you have submitted, or any ballot title I would substitute, is not misleading,” Griffin explained. “The following quotes are taken from the relevant sections of your proposed text.”

We are proud to announce the formation of Arkansans for Limited Government, a ballot question committee dedicated to restoring the freedom to make personal healthcare decisions in Arkansas. pic.twitter.com/Qxt1Vcpq7g — For AR People (@ForARPeople1) November 27, 2023

Griffin took issue with the way the language used the terms “access” and “health,” according to the letter. The former, Griffin said, could “be read in two different ways depending on how the phrase” is used.

“Is your intent to limit government action regarding abortion itself or regarding access to abortion? Under the Arkansas Supreme Court’s caselaw, the ballot title would need to describe the nature of the restriction you intend to propose. Because of this lack of clarity, I am unable to say that your ballot title is not misleading.”

He also argued that the definition of “health” was not clear enough for voters and depending on the meaning could “give voters ‘serious ground for reflection,'” according to the letter.

”Is the term intended to cover physical health only, or also mental health?” Griffin asked. “If the term is limited to physical health, is that intended to be restricted to emergent medical conditions? Or does the term also extend to pregnancies that increase the risk of certain medical complications?”

Griffin concluded the letter by explaining that AGL should “redesign” the amendment’s title and text before filing again.

ALG told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a prepared statement that they appreciated Griffin’s “thorough review of and impartial response to the amendment’s language.” The group said that they “will begin work immediately” to update the language.

Arkansas law currently prohibits abortion in all cases, except in the event that a doctor determines it is necessary to save the life of the mother, according to the text. The law went into effect following the Supreme Court’s decision in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Nov 28 2023,Arkansas attorney general rejects ballot language for abortion access constitutional amendment,KTVE,center,https://myarklamiss.com/news/arkansas-news/arkansas-attorney-general-rejects-ballot-language-for-abortion-access-constitutional-amendment,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Attorney General Tim Griffin has rejected the ballot title and language for a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would restore abortion access in Arkansas.

An opinion issued by Griffin’s office Tuesday found fault with the language and technical details of the ballot proposal, which backers said would make reproductive health decisions private up to the 18th week of pregnancy part of the state constitution.

The opinion cited “ambiguities” in the proposal that prevented him from approving it, including its use of the words “access” and “health” in several places, which the opinion stated lacked clarity in the way the words were used.

A second component of the ballot title that was intended to restrict the state legislature in passing laws restricting abortion access was also unclear, the opinion stated.

The “18th week” was also an issue because, per the opinion, it was based on 18 weeks after conception, but the legal standard for fetus age is gestational age, which begins at the date of the woman’s last menstrual cycle.

“When counting from the more standard starting point, the reference to ‘18 weeks’ is closer to ‘20 weeks,’” the opinion stated.

The opinion also claimed the popular name of the proposal, “The Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment,” is “tinged with partisan coloring.”

Another reason for rejection stated in the opinion was a failure by the ballot language to describe its impact on existing laws, including Constitutional Amendment 68.

Amendment 68 was created in 1988 and states that “The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.”

The group that submitted the proposal may now resubmit one that addresses the issues found in the AG opinion."

Oct 26 2023,Four Texas Counties Now Ban Travel for Abortions,The Texas Observer,not-yet-rated,https://texasobserver.org/four-texas-counties-now-ban-travel-for-abortions,"Originally published by Truthout. Subscribe to their newsletter here.

Lubbock County, Texas, is now the fourth and largest county in the state to pass an anti-abortion ordinance that would bar pregnant Texans from traveling to access an out-of-state abortion.

Lubbock now joins three other Texas counties—Goliad, Mitchell and Cochran—that have passed similar anti-abortion travel ordinances.

Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the country, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Many Texans are forced to travel out of state—or even out of country—to access an abortion; it is estimated that Texans seeking an abortion have to travel an average of 240 miles each way to access care.

Abortion travel bans are enforced through private civil lawsuits filed against people who “knowingly transport any individual for the purpose of providing or obtaining an elective abortion, regardless of where the elective abortion will occur.” While the pregnant people themselves do not face legal liability, people who help them obtain an abortion could face a civil lawsuit for doing so. Anti-abortion activists have dubbed these ordinances anti-“abortion trafficking” laws.

These ordinances were drafted by ant-abortion extremist Mark Lee Dickson and former solicitor general of Texas Jonathan F. Mitchell, the architect of Texas’s “bounty hunter” abortion ban who recently demanded patient information from several Texas abortion funds. Attorney Lisa Needham has written that “Mitchell is much more than the man who helped make it legal for anti-choicers to moonlight as bounty hunters … If a culture war is going on, Mitchell is in the thick of it, representing people who used to be relegated to the legal fringes, but are now engaged in a concerted effort to move the law much further to the right.”

Dickson has also spent the last year lobbying for the passage of anti-abortion travel ordinances across the state. “Guys, I long for the day [when], coast to coast, abortion is considered a great moral, social and political wrong and is outlawed in every single state,” Dickson told the Lubbock commission.

On Tuesday, the Texas city of Amarillo, in Potter and Randall counties, held a long public hearing to consider a similar abortion travel ban that would apply to roads that lead to New Mexico and Colorado, abortion safe haven states that have seen a large uptick in patients from Texas over the past year. The Amarillo city council decided not to immediately vote on the ordinance. “These abortion trafficking ordinances really are the next stage in an abortion-free America,” said Dickson, who also made an appearance at the hearing.

Legal scholars have asserted that Dickson and Mitchell specifically crafted the ordinances to be enforced by private citizens—rather than police, sheriffs or other county officers—as a way to reduce the likelihood of an immediate court challenge, as such ordinances are likely unconstitutional.

Lubbock County Commissioner and County Judge Curtis Parrish appeared to support the sentiment of the ordinance, but was concerned that the law may not survive judicial scrutiny if it is challenged in court. “The issue isn’t whether we should stand up for the rights of the unborn or the safety of the pregnant mother, but how do we make this ordinance stand up to the scrutiny of state and federal appellate courts,” Parrish said. In the end, he abstained from voting on the measure.

Even far right Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in his concurring opinion in Dobbs, the case that overturned Roe v. Wade, wrote that, “May a state bar a resident of that state from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.”

Even if these ordinances are more like ceremonial declarations than legally binding laws, abortion travel bans will harm Texans in Lubbock and surrounding communities who want to access an out-of-state abortion.

“Texans already live under some of the most restrictive and dangerous abortion bans in the country yet anti-abortion extremists continue to push additional unnecessary, confusing and fear-inducing barriers to essential health care,” said Autumn Keiser, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas."
Oct 26 2023,Texas' abortion travel bans face a constitutional challenge,The Week - News,left,https://theweek.com/politics/texas-abortion-travel-bans-face-a-constitutional-challenge,"It is no longer legal to drive through some parts of Texas on the way to an out-of-state abortion.

The Guardian reported that commissioners in Lubbock County on Monday approved a measure ""to ban people from transporting others along local roads for abortions."" (Abortion, of course, is already illegal in the state .) Supporters of the effort say that such journeys amount to ""abortion trafficking."" ""This ordinance fully supports the belief that unborn children are human beings and that they deserve the right to life,"" said lawyer Jonathan Mitchell, who helped devise the ordinance.

Lubbock County is just the biggest — and latest — Texas community to put a travel ban in place. The Associated Press reported the campaign has been underway since 2019, with critics painting the bans as ""an effort to intimidate women from seeking abortions in places where it remains legal."" The measures ostensibly penalize only people providing transportation, not pregnant women, but it remains a real question whether the new laws are actually enforceable. ""We haven't had this kind of issue tested,"" said one law professor.

Expect challenges. ""People have a right to travel — like, for any reason,"" Charlie Hughes of the Texas Equal Access Fund told the Dallas Observer . (Indeed, abortion rates are still rising nationally despite widespread abortion bans in red states since the end of Roe v. Wade last year.) For some critics, the new measures conjure up startling possibilities: ""Instead of 'stop and frisk,' are police going to direct cars with fertile-looking passengers to pull over for a 'pee to flee'?""

'Effectively take someone hostage'

Advocates for the travel ban say it's not actually a travel ban. Another ordinance — this one in Cochran County — ""does not interfere with the right to travel,"" Mark Dickson of Right to Life East Texas told Texas Scorecard, a conservative website. It merely imposes penalties on those who ""traffic pregnant mothers across state lines for the purpose of an abortion."" The ordinance is patterned after the federal Mann Act, a 20th-century law used to prosecute the sexual trafficking of minors.

The new laws are ""unconstitutional,"" Ian Milhiser argued at Vox. The Supreme Court has long held that states ""may not impose even fairly insignificant barriers on U.S. citizens who wish to travel outside that state."" It thus follows that Texas communities ""may not effectively take someone hostage for months"" during their pregnancy. As for the Mann Act comparisons: ""The Constitution gives Congress, and not state or local governments, exclusive authority over interstate commerce.""

Not so fast, countered Hannah Rahim, writing for The Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law. There are some precedents that suggest the Constitution ""does not clearly prohibit"" states from banning abortion travel. Relying on a right to travel is ""problematic."" Texas isn't keeping anybody from leaving the state: It's just requiring them to ""still abide by the home state's restrictions on abortion"" when they go on the road. That doesn't mean such laws are wise, though. ""There are powerful normative reasons for prohibiting states from banning abortion travel.""

'A deep breath'

There are some skeptics of the new ordinances in the anti-abortion movement. World, a conservative Christian news site, reported that one doubter is Paul Linton, special counsel for Texas Alliance for Life. He said a travel ban ""in large ­measure, is unconstitutional"" because of the right to travel. Then again, it's not clear whom pro-choice groups might sue in order to overturn the ordinances: Like the state's abortion ban, the travel bans are designed to be enforced not by government officials but by private individuals suing in civil courts.

Another set of skeptics: The leaders of Amarillo, another ""majority conservative"" community in the northern part of the state. The Texas Tribune reported that the Amarillo City Council on Tuesday ""took a deep breath"" and put the brakes on a proposed abortion travel ban in that community. One resident, Keely Wilson, told the council the ban would scare people away from the city. ""If people believe they can be targeted, harassed, investigated or sued by Amarillo residents,"" she said, ""they will be much less likely to drive through or stop here."""

Nov 08 2023,Abortion is now a constitutional right in Ohio. But the work isn't done.,Ohio Capital Journal,left,https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/11/08/abortion-is-now-a-constitutional-right-in-ohio-but-the-work-isnt-done,"The celebration of the passage of Issue 1 in Ohio went long into the night, but Wednesday morning, abortion rights advocates were back at work on next steps.

Issue 1 passed with 56.62% of the vote on Tuesday in unofficial results from the Ohio Secretary of State’s office. Of the 3.86 million votes cast across Ohio, the “yes” vote made up more than 2.1 million.

The newest amendment to the Ohio Constitution, which allows the right to abortion up to fetal viability and puts medical decisions in the hands of doctors and patients, will take effect 30 days after Election Day.

In the meantime, those who supported the amendment are working through court cases regarding abortion that were started before the amendment was put to voters.

“All of us who have been continuing to fight litigation will continue to work together to ensure that restrictions and bans that are currently in place are no longer in place,” said Lauren Blauvelt, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, a coalition who led the amendment campaign.

While Blauvelt said the group was not yet revealing their legal strategy as they move forward, she acknowledged that previous lawsuits regarding the six-week abortion ban would have to be resolved.

That could mean a motion to dismiss the Hamilton County case in which the injunction was set for the six-week ban, or some other legal maneuver to deem the case moot based on the amendment’s passage.

Jessie Hill, an attorney and Case Western Reserve University law professor who presented the case against lifting a pause on the six-week ban to the Ohio Supreme Court in September, said the state could agree that the six-week ban law is now unenforceable, but she is prepared for the alternative.

“This gives us a new claim we can add into our pending litigation, and we can fight it out from there if the state insists on trying to defend its laws,” Hill told the OCJ. “But we are now in a very strong position based on the new amendment.”

Supporters also know state legislative leaders won’t go quietly after the defeat of an opposition campaign which featured Gov. Mike DeWine in anti-Issue 1 ads, and included a separate effort led by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to raise the threshold to approve a constitutional amendment, specifically meant to impact the abortion amendment vote.

DeWine has yet to comment on the passage of Issue 1, but back in August when the measure to raise the approval threshold was rejected by 57% of voters – a less than 1% difference from Tuesday night’s numbers – he said that issue was “settled.”

“And I think the people spoke – they have spoken. And so I would not look for this to come up in, certainly not in the immediate future,” DeWine told reporters at the time.

Senate President Matt Huffman told reporters on Tuesday night that the abortion fight would come back again, with promises of efforts to repeal and replace the amendment.

Historically, multiple efforts to pass a proposed amendment, right, or law have been seen, but more often than not those cases happen when an issue has failed, rather than after voters overwhelmingly pass the measure.

Tracy Thomas, director of the Center for Constitutional Law at the University of Akron, said Prohibition and women’s right to vote were examples when Americans saw multiple votes over one issue, a back-and-forth as to where the issues would land.

Legislative efforts also abounded over those issues, but the true motivation for a ballot initiative came from the people being unsatisfied with legislative efforts, so they decided for themselves.

“The point of the initiative … is meant to be responsive to the populace,” Thomas said.

Going forward, the legislature could put forth a new constitutional amendment meant to repeal or replace the reproductive rights amendment, but Thomas also said movement at the federal level for a 15-week abortion ban, or legal decisions at the U.S. Supreme Court level could complicate things, and create the question of whether the state issue can stand on its own.

“(Issue 1) is a win, but it’s just the nature of the process, it’s the best we can do at the state level,” Thomas said.

The fact that governmental leaders might continue to take a swipe at the rights voted on this past election doesn’t seem to come as a surprise to advocates, or even those who worked toward the success of Issue 1.

For Marla Zwinggi, organizing a team of 50 to collect all of the signatures obtained in Geauga County was just another step in fighting for the Ohio that she and her late mother, who was the first to sign the petition before she passed away, envision.

“We can’t just say, ‘okay, we’re fine now,’ because as soon as you let your foot off the gas, that’s when stuff happens, and the rug gets pulled out from under you,” Zwinggi said, amid Tuesday night celebrations of the amendment’s passage.

Under current law, abortion is legal up to 22 weeks in Ohio."
Nov 08 2023,The false premise at the heart of Sean Hannity’s GOP abortion strategy,Media Matters,left,https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/false-premise-heart-sean-hannitys-gop-abortion-strategy,"Sean Hannity is a Republican Party operative with close ties to Donald Trump and other Republican leaders, and with the approval of the network’s executives, he explicitly uses his Fox News show as a platform to help its candidates win elections. So his Tuesday night meltdown, in which he blamed the GOP’s string of defeats that day to its unpopular opposition to abortion rights, bears careful scrutiny.

Hannity put his finger on what he considered the problem as results rolled in showing a series of Democratic victories.

“Democrats are trying to scare women into thinking Republicans don't want abortion legal under any circumstances,” he said.

The host and his guests urged Republicans to coalesce around banning abortion beginning at 15 weeks, which Hannity argued would be less risky politically, and focusing attention on right-wing lies about the purportedly extreme positions of Democrats.

Hannity, who says he is “pro-life,” has repeatedly sought to limit the political damage caused to the Republican Party when its Supreme Court nominees overturned the protections for abortion rights that had been enshrined in Roe v. Wade in their 2022 decision. He instructed Republican Senate candidates to dodge questions about the subject during the 2022 cycle, only for his hand-picked nominees to falter. Hannity carefully led newly minted House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) to say that he didn’t intend for Congress to take action on abortion this term during Johnson’s first interview in that role last month, and the issue didn’t come up at all during Hannity’s on-air pep rally for House Republicans last week.

Hannity’s reticence is relatively canny — abortion rights played a major role in GOP defeats across the country on Tuesday, and if Republicans can’t somehow defuse the issue, it threatens the party’s political success in the 2024 elections. A new Navigator Survey poll shows Democrats in a dominant position in battleground districts, with majorities saying that the GOP position is “too extreme” and would lead to national abortion restrictions, that the Democratic position is not extreme, and that voters want abortion to be legal in all or most circumstances.

Hannity is an influential figure within the GOP, and it’s possible that Republicans will try to publicly position themselves in line with his suggested remedy. But his proposed cure for the party’s ills is nonsensical — indeed, as Hannity was speaking, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s identical plan to use a 15-week ban to hold the state House and take over the state Senate was going up in flames.

Voters have not been somehow fooled by Democrats into believing that Republicans support banning abortion. Voters rightfully don’t trust Republican intentions because Republicans say they want to ban abortion, and they generally use whatever political power they obtain to prevent as many abortions as they can.

The text of the party’s most recent platform claims that “the unborn child has a fundamental right to life which cannot be infringed” and calls for a constitutional amendment that would ban all abortions by granting 14th Amendment rights to fetuses.

Johnson says that “life begins at conception” and called abortion a “holocaust,” and he has sponsored national abortion bans beginning as early as six weeks. Anti-abortion activists are gleeful at the prospect of his leadership if the party regains the Senate and the White House.

But Republicans at the state level do not generally stop with 15-week abortion bans — they push the envelope as far as their legislative majorities allow. That has meant a total abortion ban in 13 states, nine caused via “trigger” laws which took effect immediately after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In Florida, Republican state legislators passed and Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a 15-week abortion ban in 2022. Then, after DeSantis won reelection and Republicans increased their majorities, they went back and established a six-week ban. And in addition to making abortion illegal within their states, far-right legislators have enacted laws which create bounties for private citizens who file lawsuits against anyone who knowingly “aids or abets” an abortion and ban helping a minor leave the state to obtain abortion care. There are countless stories about the devastating impacts these laws have already had on women and girls placed in dire situations.

Nor do Republicans confine their efforts to states where they win majorities. The right-wing movement’s lawyers, with the help of Trump-appointed judges, are currently trying to overturn the Food and Drug Administration’s approval of the abortion medication mifepristone, which would effectively institute a nationwide ban on a drug currently used in more than half of U.S. abortions. If their effort succeeds, they will likely deploy a similar strategy against an alternative drug, misoprostol. Meanwhile, in Congress, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-MS) is blocking hundreds of military promotions — to cheers from the right — in hopes of forcing the Biden administration to end a policy that reimburses service members for out-of-state travel to receive abortions.

And of course, the reason Republican legislators have been able to pass state-level abortion bans and threaten to pass national ones is that Trump and a Republican Senate added the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe in the first place.

The good news for Republicans is that Trump, the party’s likely presidential nominee, has very few genuine policy convictions, and recognizes that the issue poses a danger to his prospects in a general election. He was noticeably cagey in a September interview when asked about what type of abortion legislation he’d support, stating vaguely that he “would sit down with both sides and I'd negotiate something, and we'll end up with peace on that issue for the first time in 52 years,” and criticized his rival DeSantis’ six-week ban.

But that led to a chorus of criticism from Trump’s primary opponents, anti-abortion groups, and right-wing pundits, to which Trump later responded by crowing, “I was able to kill Roe v. Wade.” And there are signs that a Hannity-esque strategy of downplaying the party’s unpopular abortion stance could face fury from right-wing media figures who make their money by loudly proclaiming stands that appeal to a tiny, fervent minority.

If interviewers and debate moderators do their jobs, Trump should face a slew of questions between now and next year’s election where the desired answers of right-wing anti-abortion activists and average Americans diverge. Journalists have a responsibility to try to elicit a clearer position not only about what type of abortion bans he’d sign or veto, but about what he would do on federal regulatory issues like the availability of abortion medications.

“Polls are now closed in several key states, where close races could serve as maybe a small preview of coming attractions for the 2024 election,” Hannity said last night, before the carnage for the GOP became apparent. That’s true, and support for abortion rights is a big part of the reason why."
Nov 28 2023,Texas justices hear a case about the state's three overlapping bans on abortion,NPR Fact Check,left,https://npr.org/2023/11/28/1215697564/texas-justices-hear-a-case-about-the-states-three-overlapping-bans-on-abortion,"Texas justices hear a case about the state's three overlapping bans on abortion

The Texas Supreme Court held a hearing on the state's medical exception to its abortion bans. Plaintiffs including women and doctors say the law is endangering lives in complicated wanted pregnancies.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

At a hearing in Austin today, the justices of the Texas Supreme Court heard a case about the state's abortion ban - specifically about whether the medical exemption in the bans are too narrowing and confusing. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has been following this case closely and is here to tell us more. Hi, there.

SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.

SUMMERS: All right. So Selena, before we dig into what happened today, lay out the case for us. Who is suing, and what are they asking for?

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So this case was brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights, and they're representing 20 patients who had serious pregnancy complications but were denied abortions or faced delays and also two OB-GYNs who say they can't practice medicine properly because the abortion bans are unclear. And if they interpret them incorrectly, they could face life in prison and the loss of their medical license. So they're asking the court to clarify the medical exception so that doctors have more leeway to use their judgment to provide abortions when they consider it medically necessary.

SUMMERS: And what is it about the abortion law in the state of Texas that they say is not clear?

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: So there are currently three overlapping abortion bans. Abortion is illegal in the state from the moment pregnancy begins. There is a medical exception that says abortions are allowed if the life of the patient or a, quote, ""major bodily function"" are in jeopardy. And the state has been fiercely defensive about the law. And they say - attorneys for the state say the language of the medical exception is clear and sufficient, and they suggest that doctors are responsible for any harms that the patients claim in this case.

SUMMERS: Huh. OK, so what happened today? Give us some of the highlights.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, right off the bat, the justices asked about this question of clarity. This is Beth Klusmann. She was arguing for the Texas attorney general's office. She only made it less than a minute into her opening statement when she was interrupted by Justice Debra Lehrmann.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DEBRA LEHRMANN: Can you give us a - just a bright-line rule about what medical emergency means?

BETH KLUSMANN: Your Honor, I can only point the court to what the legislature has said that the - what the medical emergency exception means - the life-threatening, physical condition that's caused or aggravated by a pregnancy that puts a woman at risk of death or substantial risk of serious impairment of a major bodily function.

LEHRMANN: And you acknowledge that that puts medical professionals in a really bad situation?

KLUSMANN: No, Your Honor, I don't think it does.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: This was a theme of the hearing. Is that language unclear? And if it is, what's the role of the state Supreme Court to clarify the statute? The justices really seemed to wrestle with this question. And another big theme was standing. So Texas has argued that none of the patients have standing to sue because they were harmed in the past, and any future harm is theoretical. Here is how the Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Molly Duane responded to that argument in the courtroom today. And just a warning - her comments are fairly graphic.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MOLLY DUANE: Then the court would be saying that a patient needs to have blood or amniotic fluid dripping down their leg before they can come to court. And quite obviously, patients in those situations are much more concerned with getting proper medical care and saving their lives, their fertility and their families than they are with finding a lawyer and coming to court.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Several of the justices seemed, to me, to agree that at least some of the plaintiffs do have standing and that there is confusion among doctors and that the lack of clarity in the law as it stands is problematic.

SUMMERS: OK. And Selena, what does this mean for abortion in the state of Texas? What comes next?

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, for now, abortions are still banned in Texas. What is next is the Texas Supreme Court will have to decide if the medical exception should change temporarily as the case continues through the legal system. The decision could come in the next few weeks, but the timing isn't easy to predict. That's what Professor Liz Sepper of Texas Law in Austin told me.

LIZ SEPPER: It will depend a great deal on getting agreement. This case, I think, became more tangled the more that the justices pulled on the thread.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She also said that, watching the hearing today, it was hard to get a read on the whole court, but she does think there's a good chance this case will proceed to trial, which is scheduled for next April. And the hearing on the injunction was - in the district court last July - was really dramatic. You had four patients testifying about their sagas with serious complications, doctors not even willing to say the word abortion to them. Some had to travel to other states. Two plaintiffs developed sepsis while waiting for Texas hospitals to provide abortion. So if the trial does go ahead in the spring, it will definitely be one to watch.

SUMMERS: NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. Thank you.

SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Thank you.

Nov 08 2023,"Ohio voters reject Republican tactics, back abortion rights",MSNBC,left,https://msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ohio-voters-reject-republican-tactics-back-abortion-rights-rcna124151,"When it came to defeating a proposed state constitutional amendment on abortion rights, Ohio Republicans tried everything they could think of to win.

They tried to force proponents to get 60% of the vote. They tried purging registered Ohioans from the voter rolls. They added needlessly provocative “unborn child” phrasing to the literal wording of the initiative as it appeared on the ballot. GOP leaders in the state even lied to the public about the implications of the measure.

The party and its allies thought it’d be enough, especially in Ohio, which has become a reliably “red” state. They thought wrong. NBC News reported that the state’s voters have added the right to access abortion care to the state’s constitution.

The passage of the Issue 1 ballot measure inserts language in the state constitution guaranteeing every person in Ohio the right “to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion,” and barring the state from “burdening, penalizing or prohibiting” those rights — though it specifies that abortion will remain prohibited after the point a doctor judges a fetus would most likely survive birth, with exceptions to protect the woman’s life or health.

It wasn’t especially close: With nearly all of the votes counted, proponents of reproductive rights appear to have prevailed by more than 13 points.

I’m reminded of a line The Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne wrote in a column published over the summer: “When you do everything you can to rig an election and still lose, you have a problem.”

NBC News’ report added that the success of Issue 1 “will effectively counteract the state’s ‘heartbeat bill,’ which took effect immediately after the Dobbs decision and banned most abortions — with exceptions for the health of the pregnant woman and ectopic pregnancies — but remains temporarily blocked by a state judge.”

A Washington Post analysis added that Ohio has become “the seventh state to vote to protect access to abortion in a statewide initiative since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court last year. Four of those initiatives were on the ballot in states that Joe Biden lost in the 2020 election; in all seven, the abortion-access position outperformed Biden’s support in the state.”

Since the demise of Roe, how many statewide votes on abortion have Republicans won? Literally none."

Nov 07 2023,Ohio voters approve abortion rights amendment to state constitution,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/ohio-voters-approve-abortion-rights-amendment-to-state-constitution,"Ohioans voted on Tuesday to adopt abortion and reproductive health rights into their state constitution, with a majority voting yes on Issue 1.

The amendment takes effect immediately to enshrine the right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” which includes fertility treatments, miscarriage care, contraception, and abortions, into the state constitution.

THESE FOUR ‘SQUAD’ DEMOCRATS FACE BRUTAL PRIMARY CHALLENGERS

Pro-abortion rights groups initiated the ballot measure in response to the six-week abortion ban that was passed and signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019. At that time, the law was blocked by the courts due to federal protections for abortion in the first trimester under Roe v. Wade.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe in June 2022, the six-week abortion ban has been under legal review by the state’s courts.

“The aftermath of the gutting of Roe v. Wade last year has moved public opinion vehemently away from extremist bans and restrictions and toward reproductive freedom,” said Rachel O’Leary Carmona, executive director of Women’s March.

Anti-abortion advocates campaigned ardently against the amendment’s prohibition of state actions that “directly or indirectly [to] burden, penalize, or interfere with or discriminate against” a citizen’s reproductive choices, saying this would nullify existing state laws regulating the controversial procedure.

“Issue One is not a resurrection of the status quo [under Roe v. Wade],” May Mailman, the vice president for legal, strategy and communications at RITE, told reporters ahead of Tuesday’s vote.

“Because constitutional language supersedes regular statutes, Issue One would upend long-standing Ohio laws governing the abortion process, including laws governing late-term or particularly unethical abortion practices and laws governing parental notification,” Mailman said.

Advocates of the amendment say that pro-abortion rights groups will not push against existing parental consent laws in Ohio, but Mailman said these laws could reasonably be interpreted as interference against children’s rights if taken to court in the future.

DeWine has been an outspoken critic of the amendment in recent weeks, calling it too extreme for the Buckeye State.

“If you look at Issue 1, it’s a radical proposal, and whether you’re pro-choice or pro-life, it just goes much, much too far,” DeWine said on CBS News’s Face the Nation on Sunday.

In previous statements, DeWine has said that although the legislature can regulate abortion after the point of fetal viability, which is when the child can survive outside of the womb, the amendment allows a mother’s physician to perform an abortion if carrying the pregnancy to completion would jeopardize her health.

“There is a wide exception written into this law, which talks about the health of the mother,” DeWine said. “The Supreme Court, the United States has defined this extremely broadly — [it] can mean health, can mean something having to do with her income, it can have something to do with how many children she has, and again, it is the person performing the abortion in the clinic who’s going to make that determination, and there’s no review of [that].”

President Joe Biden said in response to the vote that Ohioans “rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans” that are “out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.”

“Decisions around pregnancy, including abortion, birth control, and miscarriage care, are personal and private and should be left up to women and their families,” the leading pro-abortion rights group in the state, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, said. “This amendment is about who makes personal decisions for yourself and your family — you or the government.”

Several states, including Florida, South Dakota, and Arizona, will be weighing similar abortion rights amendments in 2024.

“We have no doubt that the winning streak will continue in every state where abortion rights are up for a vote, and that the electorate’s rejection of radical anti-choice bans will carry into the 2024 election,” said O’Leary Carmona.

The GAO report was first requested in early 2022 by 142 congressional members led by Republican Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who underscored their concerns that taxpayer dollars are being used to fund abortion services. The report revealed that Planned Parenthood received approximately $1.78 billion in taxpayer funding from 2019 to 2021 and is receiving increased federal support under the current Biden administration. (RELATED: Your Credit Card Company Might Be Bankrolling Left-Wing Activism)

“It is appalling that big abortion providers are continuing to receive billions of dollars in federal taxpayer funding,” Blackburn told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. “The American people want their tax dollars spent responsibly and in line with our nation’s values — not on the Left’s abortion-on-demand agenda. I will never stop fighting to protect the unborn and end taxpayer-funded support for the abortion industry.”

“Federal taxpayer dollars should not be funneled to big abortion corporations like Planned Parenthood, which has killed over 9.3 million unborn children since 1970, including 1.11 million between 2019-2021,” Smith told the DCNF in a statement. “This money would have been better spent helping the businesses that were forced to close or providing comprehensive medical support for both women and children.”

.@PPFA thinks any reason is the right reason for an abortion up until birth. These are the radicals, not pro-life advocates. https://t.co/NvODSkTEcI — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) June 1, 2023

Planned Parenthood was granted approximately $90 million in forgiven loans during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the GAO report. These loans were meant to be provided to small businesses with 500 employees or less, but Planned Parenthood has over 16,000 employees through affiliates worldwide and still took the funding.

“Planned Parenthood illegally siphoned over $90 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, specifically designed to help our mom-and-pop shops keep their doors open,” Blackburn told the DCNF.

The Biden administration increased funding obligations to Planned Parenthood from approximately $5.7 million to $27 million between 2021 to 2022, a total 373% increase, according to the GAO report. The Biden administration also revoked a Trump administration rule in January 2021 that prevented funding from being used by foreign organizations to provide abortion services.

Aside from Planned Parenthood, five other abortion providers, including MSI Reproductive Choices, received over $100 million in taxpayer funding, according to the GAO report.

Approximately 60% percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer funding to pay for abortion services, according to a 2023 Marist poll, while 78% of Americans oppose taxpayer funding being used for abortion services in other countries.

The Marist poll was conducted from Jan. 6 to Jan. 9 with 1,025 respondents from both political parties. The margin of error was within ±3.5 percentage points.

Dec 05 2023,Tuberville ends blockade of most military promotions after months-long abortion fight,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/tuberville-ends-blockade-most-military-promotions-months-long-abortion-fight,"Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., announced on Tuesday he is finally backing down from his hold on hundreds of military promotions to protest the Pentagon's abortion policy.

Tuberville told reporters he would release all holds except for four-star generals after a nine-month long protest that angered several of his colleagues, including Republicans who feared the stalled promotions would impact military readiness.

The former college football coach claimed he could not continue his hold after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ""changed the rules"" in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), an annual must-pass defense spending bill.

""I'd love to have had five downs in football instead of four, but you can't do it. It's got to be fair for everybody,"" Tuberville said. ""So that being said, I'm not going to hold the promotions of these people any longer. We just released them.""

TUBERVILLE NOT BUDGING ON MILITARY HOLDS OVER ABORTION POLICY AS DEMS EYE RULES CHANGE

Tuberville began blocking President Biden's military nominations in February over what he said was the Pentagon's ""illegal"" policy of providing travel expense reimbursement to service members who seek an abortion. The Biden administration adopted the policy last year in response to the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and held the U.S. Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.

Almost 400 military nominations have since been in limbo due to Tuberville’s blanket hold on confirmations and promotions for senior military officers. It’s a Tuberville's opponents say has left key national security positions unfilled and military families with an uncertain path forward.

PENTAGON ASKS FOR $114m TO SPEND ON DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION AND ACCESSIBILITY IN 2024

In October, a bipartisan group of lawmakers planned to maneuver around Tuberville's hold by introducing a rules change in the Senate Rules Committee that would allow them to approve a batch of nominees through 2024.

Majority Leader Schumer last week said he would bring a resolution to the Senate floor that would adopt the rules change and circumvent Tuberville.

DEFENSE SECRETARY AUSTIN VISITS UKRAINE AS PENTAGON URGES CONGRESS TO PASS ADDITIONAL AID TO FIGHT RUSSIA

After Tuberville's announcement, Schumer spoke at a press conference and said that lawmakers would move the delayed military promotions as soon as Tuesday afternoon.

""I want to say, in regarding Senator Tuberville, in regards to Tuberville finally lifting his unnecessary and harmful holds on our nation's military officials, I'm happy that we can finally move forward and give these men and women the promotions they deserve. I plan to move these promotions as soon as possible, possibly later this afternoon,"" Schumer said.

He added, ""I hope no one does this again, and I hope they learn the lesson of Senator Tuberville. And that is: He held out for many, many months, hurt our national security, caused discombobulation to so many military families who have been so dedicated to our country and didn't get anything he wanted.

Nov 08 2023,"Abortion, Not Biden, Propels Democrats to Off-Year Election Wins",U.S. News & World Report,left,https://usnews.com/news/elections/articles/2023-11-08/abortion-not-biden-propels-democrats-to-off-year-election-wins,"Another off-year election, another good night for Democrats – a rejoinder to a spate of recent polls showing alarming 2024 prospects for President Joe Biden.

In Election Day’s marquee contests – the Kentucky gubernatorial race, Virginia’s legislative elections and a pro-abortion-rights ballot measure in Ohio – Democrats notched victories. To one degree or another, each hinged on voter support for abortion rights.



In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won a second term by a 5-point margin over Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron. Despite Kentucky’s strong Republican leanings, Beshear benefited from incumbency and strong approval ratings, and he managed to prevent Republicans from painting him as a Biden clone. Beshear also successfully painted Cameron as too conservative on abortion, even in a red state.

In Virginia, GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin lost his high-stakes bid to flip the Democratic-held Senate, which would have enabled him to enact a conservative agenda, including a 15-week abortion ban. Not only did the state Senate remain in Democratic hands, but the GOP also lost its majority in the state House.

And in Ohio, voters by a double-digit margin approved Issue 1, which establishes a state constitutional right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” while essentially reimposing the status quo under Roe v. Wade, which the Supreme Court overturned last year.

Beshear’s reelection in Kentucky had much to do with the difficulty of ousting a reasonably popular incumbent, says Al Cross, director of the University of Kentucky’s Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues.

As the face of natural disaster recovery, Beshear fared especially well in portions of eastern Kentucky that had experienced severe storms during his tenure, Cross noted. In Letcher County (Whitesburg), Beshear was ahead by 5 points after losing the county by 8 in 2019. In Perry County (Hazard), he was leading by 11 after losing it by 9 four years ago. And in Breathitt County (Jackson), he was winning by 22 points in a county he’d only won by 2 points in 2019.

Beyond that, “the real test was Trump’s ability to move voters in a state race,” Cross says. “I’m not sure how much he did, but it was not enough.”

In the Virginia races, Rich Meagher, a Randolph-Macon College political scientist, says Youngkin deserves credit for taking the risk of ""being a real strong party leader. But, boy, did that gamble not pay off. It's hard to imagine a worse outcome for him and his political future.""

One clear indication of the salience of abortion as an issue for voters, the Ohio ballot measure was winning in more than two dozen counties, a far larger number than the Democratic nominee won in Ohio’s 2022 gubernatorial race (three), its 2022 Senate race (eight) or its 2020 presidential race (seven).



The pro-abortion rights vote “was predictably high in urban and suburban areas, but it was surprising how narrow the margins were for ‘no’ in so many rural and small-town counties where Republicans normally run up big numbers,” says Ohio State University political scientist Paul Beck.

Other contests went the Democrats’ way, too.

In Pennsylvania, Democrat Daniel McCaffery defeated Republican Carolyn Carluccio for a seat on the state Supreme Court, which now has a 5-2 Democratic edge heading into a 2024 election, when voting-related litigation is expected in a presidential battleground state. Democrats also appeared to win seats on lower courts.

As with the other headline contests nationally, the issue in the Supreme Court race “was really abortion,” says Larry Ceisler, a Philadelphia-based Democratic consultant. “It sends a good signal for Democrats in Pennsylvania in 2024.”

In neighboring New Jersey, Democrats held on to their existing legislative majorities with ease, even flipping a handful of Republican-held seats. Democrats are on track to maintain their 25-15 edge in the Senate and should add a few seats to the 46-34 edge in the Assembly that they had coming into Election Day.

“I can’t recall another New Jersey cycle in which one party won every one of its top legislative targets and the other party came up short across the state,” says Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics. “Republicans focused on all the wrong things – parental notification and criticisms of wind energy failed to motivate enough of their voters to turn out. Democrats, he says, were well prepared after a closer-than-expected governor's race two years ago, highlighting new property tax rebates as well as social issues.

Liberals scored another victory in Ohio, as Issue 2 – a measure to permit the recreational use of marijuana – passed by a similar margin to the abortion measure.

About the only bright spot for Republicans in a top-tier race was in Mississippi, where Gov. Tate Reeves won a second term – though the race was relatively close for a deep red state.

Democrat Brandon Presley, an elected member of the state Public Service Commission (and a distant relative of Elvis Presley), ran an aggressive campaign against Reeves. But a Democrat hasn’t won an election for Mississippi governor since 1999, and Presley ended up in the same place as another seemingly strong Democratic challenger, then-Attorney General Jim Hood, who lost to Reeves in an open-seat contest four years ago by 5 points.

Reeves prevailed by roughly the same 5-point margin, in a state where voting patterns are highly polarized by race and crossover voting is limited.

“Reeves was effective in branding Presley as a liberal Democrat, which he certainly was not on social issues, and someone who received most of his money from out-of-state liberal funders,” says Steve Rozman, a Tougaloo College political scientist. Donald Trump’s late ads endorsing Reeves “were an added bonus,” Rozman says.



Republicans could also take solace that in both Kentucky and Mississippi, their down-ballot nominees fared significantly better than their gubernatorial candidates did.

In Kentucky’s open-seat race for attorney general, Republican Russell Coleman ran more than 10 points ahead of Cameron in defeating the Democratic nominee, Pamela Stevenson. Republican Secretary of State Michael Adams – who worked with Beshear to negotiate bipartisan electoral reforms during his first term – ran about 13 points ahead of Cameron in his victory over Democrat Buddy Wheatley.

Meanwhile, in Mississippi, Republican Attorney General Lynn Fitch outpaced Reeves by about 7 points in winning a second term against Democrat Greta Kemp Martin. In the secretary of state race, incumbent Michael Watson, a Republican, outran Reeves by more than 8 points in defeating Democrat Ty Pinkins.

Beyond Ohio, a few other states decided ballot measures.

In Maine, voters overwhelmingly rejected Question 3, which would have turned two existing for-profit electric providers in Maine into a single, publicly owned utility called Pine Tree Power. Opponents successfully argued that the acquisition cost could have reached $13.5 billion, putting Pine Tree Power in a debt hole from day one.

Voters simultaneously approved Question 1, which would have required voter approval for certain state entities, including utilities, to incur more than $1 billion in debt. It was widely seen as a backstop for opponents of Pine Tree Power in the event Question 3 had passed.

The utilities “remain deeply unpopular,” says University of Maine political scientist Mark Brewer. “But the public utility plan was half-baked at best and this uncertainty concerned voters. Plus the campaign against it was effective.”

Maine voters did easily approve Question 4, which confirmed that vehicle owners and independent car repair shops could access information, tools and software to repair vehicles, something critics say are sometimes hoarded by auto manufacturers."

Nov 07 2023,Ohio Voters to Decide on Abortion Rights Amendment on Election Day,Christian Headlines,center,https://christianheadlines.com/contributors/milton-quintanilla/ohio-voters-to-decide-on-abortion-rights-amendment-on-election-day.html,"On Tuesday, voters in Ohio will head to the polls to vote for a measure that could establish a constitutional right to an abortion in the state.

The measure titled Issue 1, would establish a constitutional right to an abortion would ""establish in the Constitution of the State of Ohio an individual right to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion"" and ""create legal protections for any person or entity that assists a person with receiving reproductive medical treatment.”

If a “no” vote prevails, then the current restrictions on abortion remain intact, per Fox News.

According to the pro-life group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Ohio is one of 25 states that have implemented pro-life protections after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade last year, returning the issue of abortion up to the states. Although Ohio approved a law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, the measure currently faces litigation, The Christian Post reports.

According to ABC News, Ohio is the only state to tackle a statewide abortion-rights question this year, including funding tens of millions of dollars in campaign spending, rallies in favor or in opposition to the amendment, and months of promotion and messaging across social media platforms.

In 2024, abortion-related measures will be on the ballot for several other states, including Arizona, Missouri, and Florida.

Based on public polling, two-thirds of Americans are in favor of legal abortion during the early stages of pregnancy.

Regarding Ohio Issue 1, a poll conducted by Ohio Northern University found that 60 percent of Ohioans plan to vote on the measure while 40 percent plan to vote against it. Meanwhile, a survey conducted by Baldwin Wallace University found that 58 percent of registered voters expressed support for issue one while 34 percent opposed it.

If voted on, then Ohio becomes the fourth state to have established a constitutional right to an abortion after Roe V. Wade was overturned. Following last year’s election, California, Michigan, and Vermont voted on measures similar to Issue 1.

Late last month, officials with Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America warned that pro-abortion advocacy groups are working to vote on referendums establishing a constitutional right to abortion in states with strong pro-life restrictions, including Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.

Dec 11 2023,Texas woman who appealed to state supreme court to have an abortion goes elsewhere for one,The Daily Herald,center,https://dailyherald.com/news/20231212/texas-woman-who-appealed-to-state-supreme-court-to-have-an-abortion-goes-elsewhere-for-one,"Demonstrators march in Austin, Texas, after Roe was nullified. Associated Press/File 2022

AUSTIN, Texas - A pregnant Texas woman who was seeking court permission for an abortion in an unprecedented challenge to one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. could not wait any longer and went to another state, her attorneys said Monday.

The announcement came as Kate Cox, whose fetus has a fatal condition, was waiting for the Texas Supreme Court to rule whether she could legally receive an abortion. Her baby's diagnosis has low survival rates, and her attorneys said continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.

""Her health is on the line. She's been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn't wait any longer,"" said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was representing Cox.

The organization did not disclose where Cox went. On Monday, she would have been 20 weeks and six days pregnant.

The court, which is made up of nine Republican justices, had given no timetable for a ruling. On Friday night, the court had paused a lower a judge's order that gave Cox permission for an abortion.

Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from Dallas, had been to the emergency room at least four times since becoming pregnant in August, according to her attorneys.

Cox was believed to be the first woman in the U.S. to ask a court for permission for an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. Her lawsuit quickly became a high-profile test of bans in Texas and a dozen other GOP-controlled states, where abortion is prohibited at nearly all stages of pregnancy.

Days after Cox filed her lawsuit, a pregnant woman in Kentucky also asked a court to allow an abortion. There has been no ruling yet in that case.

Earlier Monday, two medical groups in the U.S. urged the Texas Supreme Court to rule in favor of Cox.

Texas' abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger - but not for fetal anomalies.

Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has defended the state's strict anti-abortion laws for nearly a decade, argued that Cox did not demonstrate the pregnancy had put her life in danger.

""The Texas Legislature did not intend for courts to become revolving doors of permission slips to obtain abortions,"" Paxton's office wrote in a filing to the state Supreme Court last week.

Dr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Colorado and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said when lethal fetal anomalies are diagnosed ""there's only risk to that pregnant person and no benefit unfortunately for that innocent child.""

""You are putting your body through risks without any benefit because prolonging the pregnancy doesn't change the survival rate,"" Zahedi-Spung said.

Doctors told Cox her fetus has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth, and low survival rates, according to her lawsuit filed last week in Austin. They also told Cox that inducing labor or carrying the baby to term could jeopardize her ability to have another child.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine say there is no live birth in about 70% of pregnancies involving the diagnosis that proceed past 12 weeks gestational age,

Oct 25 2023,Georgia Supreme Court rejects challenge to abortion law,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/georgia-supreme-court-rejects-challenge-abortion-law,"The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a lower court ruling that the state's restrictive abortion law was invalid, leaving limited access to abortions unchanged for now.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said last November that the ban was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019, when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions well past six weeks. Georgia’s law bans most abortions after roughly six weeks.

The Georgia Supreme Court in a 6-1 decision said McBurney was wrong.

GA SENATE APPROVES BILL TO GIVE CASH TO LOW-INCOME PREGNANT WOMEN

""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court’s new interpretation of the Constitution’s meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia said in a news release the opinion disregards ""long-standing precedent that a law violating either the state or federal Constitution at the time of its enactment is void from the start under the Georgia Constitution.""

The group represented doctors and advocacy groups that had asked McBurney to throw out the law.

The ruling does not change abortion access in Georgia and is not the last word on the state’s ban.

TRUMP FACING MORE HEAT FOR CALLING SIX-WEEK ABORTION BAN 'A TERRIBLE THING' AS BIG NAMES PILE ON

The state Supreme Court had previously allowed enforcement of the ban to resume while it considered an appeal of the lower court decision. The lower court judge has also not ruled on the merits of other arguments in a lawsuit challenging the ban, including that it violates Georgia residents' rights to privacy.

In its ruling on Tuesday, the state Supreme Court sent the case back to McBurney to consider those arguments.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican who signed Georgia's ban, hailed the ruling.

""Today’s victory represents one more step towards ending this litigation and ensuring the lives of Georgians at all ages are protected,"" he said in a statement.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, in a statement late Tuesday, said such bans have had ""dangerous impacts"" on women across the country.

""Women have been denied the medical care they desperately need to preserve their health, including being turned away from emergency rooms, forced to travel hundreds of miles for care and faced complications that make it more difficult to have children in the future,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""It doesn't end there. Republican elected officials are doubling down and calling for a national abortion ban that would criminalize reproductive health care in every state. President Biden and Vice President Harris won't stop fighting until the protections of Roe v. Wade are restored in federal law.""

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, said it would continue the suffering women have faced. SisterSong is one of the plaintiffs challenging Georgia's law.

""This abortion ban has forced Georgians to travel across state lines at great expense or continue the life-altering consequences of pregnancy and childbirth against their wills,"" she said in a statement.

McBurney had said the law was void from the start, and therefore, the measure did not become law when it was enacted and could not become law even after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.

State officials challenging that decision noted the Supreme Court’s finding that Roe v. Wade was an incorrect interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Because the Constitution remained the same, Georgia’s ban was valid when it was enacted, they argued.

In Tuesday's ruling, Colvin said McBurney's decision was based on the ""faulty premise"" that the U.S. Supreme Court changed the meaning of the U.S. Constitution when it overruled Roe.

GEORGIA GOV. BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

The court does not have that power, she said, so the Constitution ""means today what it meant when"" Georgia's ban was enacted in 2019.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Ellington said ""well-settled Georgia law"" establishes that a legislative act that is unconstitutional on the date it is enacted is void ""forever afterward.""

Georgia's law bans most abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many women know they are pregnant.

The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable."
Nov 07 2023,"Virginia's House and Senate are up for grabs, with abortion access at stake",CNBC,center,https://cnbc.com/2023/11/07/virginias-house-and-senate-are-up-for-grabs-with-abortion-access-at-stake-.html,"Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin holds a pair of squash while touring an H Mart supermarket while meeting with Asian community leaders on April 06, 2023 in Fairfax, Virginia. Youngkin spent the morning visiting with constituents across Northern Virginia.

Virginia's narrowly divided legislature is up for grabs Tuesday, as voters head to the polls in an election that could decide the future of abortion in the Old Dominion, and test the political winds in the key swing state ahead of the 2024 presidential contest.

Republicans currently have a narrow 51-to-46 majority in the House of Delegates, while Democrats hold a slim 22-to-18 edge in the state Senate. All 140 state seats are on the ballot Tuesday.

The election is a toss-up, with the likely voter pool evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, according to two recent polls.

Inflation and the economy are the top issues on voters' minds, two areas where polls show Republicans have an advantage. But Tuesday's election also hinges on voter turnout, and here, Democrats have the edge.

If Republican majorities take over both chambers, they will almost certainly enact a controversial 15-week abortion ban proposed by Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. This prospect has made abortion a major issue in the races.

It has also drawn national money into the contests, where Democratic candidates have raised more overall than the Republicans, according to an analysis by the Virginia Public Access Project.

In the Senate, Democrats have pulled in $12.7 million in contributions, compared with the $10.6 million Republicans have raised. In the House, Democrats booked $14.2 million, compared with the Republicans' $8.4 million.

Tuesday's legislative races are the first statewide elections in Virginia since Republicans broke unified Democratic control of the Old Dominion in 2021. That year, Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe to become governor, and the GOP swept into the majority in the House of Delegates.

The Republican victory suggested Virginia voters were shifting to the right, just a year after Joe Biden trounced Donald Trump in the state in 2020. Youngkin remains popular in Virginia, with a 54% approval rating, while Biden is a burden for Democrats in the state, with an approval rating hovering just above 40%."

The proposal would enshrine the right to abortion up to 24 weeks in the state constitution, allowing only abortions deemed “necessary” by a doctor after that point. The state’s current law allows abortions up to 24 weeks, with exceptions to protect the life of the mother or if the fetus receives a fatal diagnosis.

CONCORD, N.H. — State lawmakers are fighting a proposal that would ban abortions in New Hampshire after 15 days gestation, and said Monday they plan to introduce a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion in the Granite State.

“While abortion is currently safe and legal in New Hampshire, to date, New Hampshire lawmakers have refused to make abortion an explicit right,” said Representative Amanda Elizabeth Toll, a Keene Democrat sponsoring the legislation, in a written statement. “Right now that means that we have zero state or federal protections in place that safeguard the right to an abortion.”

Debate over state law governing abortion has intensified after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court last summer, putting the power of regulating abortions in the hands of state lawmakers.

A constitutional amendment requires a three-fifths vote from both the House and the Senate before it’s put to New Hampshire voters during the November 2024 election. Two-thirds of those voting on the measure must support it for it to pass.

Two Republican representatives joined the 11 Democrats sponsoring the legislation: Susan Vandecasteele of Salem and Brandon Phinney of Rochester.

Asked if he would support the effort, a spokesperson for Governor Chris Sununu referred the Globe to a statement he made last summer.

“I have made clear I support codifying Roe v. Wade into law, and stand ready to sign a bill once it reaches my desk,” he said.

Sununu describes himself as pro-choice, although abortion rights advocates have criticized that description since he signed a 24-week abortion ban into law in 2021.

But Sununu was quick to dismiss the bill sponsored by four House Republicans that emerged last week, prohibiting abortion other than for a medical emergency after 15 days of gestation, at which point the embryo is about the size of a poppy seed and most women do not yet know they are pregnant. It would amount to an outright ban on abortion, which is unlikely to pass in New Hampshire.

“I think it’s safe to say we are putting this one in the crazy pile,” Sununu said in a written statement. Other members of Republican House leadership dismissed the proposed ban, noting it would not gain the support required to become law.

Senator Carrie Gendreau, whose extremely conservative Christian views sparked controversy in Littleton after she spoke against LGBTQ+ artwork, is among the lawmakers supporting the 15-day ban.

“I don’t see this bill going anyplace,” Republican House Speaker Sherman Packard said on WFEA Radio last week.

“We’re happy with what we have, with the ban at 24 weeks,” he said.

One Republican representative who had initially signed on in support of the measure withdrew her support days after the proposal became public.

“HB 1248 does not represent the voice of my constituents. I have withdrawn my name as a co-sponsor,” said Kristine Perez, a Londonderry Republican, in a Facebook post. Perez said she was told the bill would be a 15-week ban and that she didn’t review the proposal before granting her support. Gendreau and Representatives Dave Testerman and John Sellers are still listed as sponsors of the legislation.

“This was my mistake and admittedly a grave one,” Perez said. “I trusted but did not verify but this is not being offered as an excuse.”

She said multiple constituents voiced support for a 15-week limit and apologized for supporting the 15-day ban.

“Although I am pro-life, I have said since first announcing my run for Representative that I would not have a personal agenda but instead be your voice,” she said. “I am truly sorry that I potentially misrepresented your voice.”

The bill did not garner the support of Cornerstone Action, an anti-abortion Christian advocacy group that criticized both the bill and its prime sponsor.

“Chief sponsor Rep. Dave Testerman has a long track record last year of not even showing up for the hearings on his own frivolous bills,” the advocacy group said in a social media post. The post said the group will focus on protecting the current 24-week ban “from continual attacks by state Democrats and the abortion lobby to return our state to unlimited abortion up to birth.”

Reproductive health care providers and reproductive health advocates praised Monday’s proposal to put protections for abortion access into New Hampshire’s constitution.

“At a time when access to abortion is increasingly under threat, this constitutional amendment is an important and a necessary step to safeguard reproductive rights in New Hampshire and to put the decision in the hands of patients and health care providers — not politicians,” Montgomery said in a written statement, noting that 22 states have banned abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

She urged lawmakers to pass the constitutional amendment, as did leadership from two medical centers that provide abortions: Lovering Health Center in Greenland and Equality Health Center in Concord.

This past year, at least two efforts to enshrine abortion rights in New Hampshire state law failed, including House Bill 88, which was rejected on a 14-10 party-line vote in the Senate, and CACR 2, a constitutional amendment that received a 193-191 vote in the House, falling short of the three-fifths required to advance.

Oct 24 2023,"In Texas, local governments are banning travel aid for abortions",Los Angeles Times,left,https://latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-10-24/in-texas-local-governments-are-banning-travel-aid-for-abortions,"Abortion rights demonstrators attend a rally at the Texas Capitol in Austin last year. Lubbock County commissioners have voted to ban drivers from transporting a person seeking an abortion.

A Texas county near New Mexico — where abortion is legal — has banned helping people traveling to get an abortion in one of the newest strategies conservatives are trying to restrict abortion access since the fall of Roe vs. Wade.

Lubbock County is the largest of four Texas counties that have now adopted a version of the measure, which would be enforced through lawsuits filed by private citizens against people who help women obtain abortions.

It is the same legal mechanism Texas used to enact a strict abortion law in 2021 before the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the state last year to ban nearly all abortions entirely.

Commissioners in the west Texas county adopted the measure 3 to 0 at a meeting Monday, rejecting some requests to postpone the vote.

The ordinance “has many legal problems,” said Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish, the county’s top elected official. “This ordinance, however, does not have a problem with its intent or the intent of those who are passionate about this.”

The measures expand on city ordinances rural Texas cities began passing in 2019 to ban abortion within their boundaries, even if the cities did not have a clinic performing abortions. Critics have attacked the campaign as an effort to intimidate women from seeking abortions in places where it remains legal.

Mark Lee Dickson, a Texas pastor who has led the efforts, praised the vote.

“Guys, I long for the day [when], coast to coast, abortion is considered a great moral, social and political wrong and is outlawed in every single state,” Dickson told commissioners.

“Texans already live under some of the most restrictive and dangerous abortion bans in the country, yet antiabortion extremists continue to push additional unnecessary, confusing and fear-inducing barriers to essential healthcare,” said Autumn Keiser, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.

Texas is one of 13 states that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In August, a Texas judge ruled that the state’s ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications. But that ruling was swiftly put on hold following an appeal by the state.

The Texas law was passed prior to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that allowed abortions nationwide.

No violations of the travel prohibition have been reported in the counties with similar measures already on the books. The measures would not punish women who are seeking abortions but would present legal risks to people who help transport them to get the procedure.

Legal experts have questioned whether the ordinances could be enforced.

“We haven’t had this kind of issue tested, so it’s really kind of a case of first impression,” said Seema Mohapatra, a health law expert and law professor at Southern Methodist University.

Lubbock County has about 317,000 residents and far outnumbers the population of the three other Texas counties — Mitchell, Goliad and Cochran — that have approved similar ordinances in recent months, with each county’s population counting fewer than 10,000 residents. Highways through Lubbock County run to New Mexico, which has seen an influx of patients since Roe was overturned.

The ban does not apply to cities within Lubbock County, including the city of Lubbock, which has about 264,000 of the county’s residents. Lubbock voters in 2021 adopted a similar measure."
Oct 24 2023,Texas counties ban traveling to obtain abortion care,KXAN News,not-yet-rated,https://kxan.com/news/texas-politics/texas-counties-ban-traveling-to-obtain-abortion-care,"AUSTIN (Nexstar) — After Texas outlawed nearly all abortions after the end of Roe v. Wade, some conservative local governments want to go further — banning their residents from traveling to obtain an abortion anywhere.

On Monday, Lubbock County passed an ordinance that prohibits assisting a county resident to obtain an abortion “regardless of the location of the abortion.” It also prohibits driving through the unincorporated areas of Lubbock County on the way to receive an abortion.

The measure significantly expands the scope of Texas’ statewide abortion ban — expanding the prohibition to Texas residents, not just Texas borders.

Mark Lee Dickson, a pastor and influential anti-abortion advocate, says the law is aimed at what he calls “abortion trafficking.”

“Even though abortion is outlawed in the state of Texas, we still have… abortion states,” Dickson said. “Just like we saw in years past during the times of slavery, there were free states and there were slave states. We’re seeing this problem that we have abortion states in America, and we need to see an America where unborn children are treated with the dignity and respect…

The ordinance, however, does not solely apply to those who “traffic” a woman against her will. Husbands, boyfriends, friends, and family members of a woman would be subject to civil liability if they drive her to receive an abortion in New Mexico, for example.

Lubbock County’s ordinance enforces the restrictions solely through private civil lawsuits, providing a cause of action to private citizens who know of someone who has helped transport a woman to receive an abortion. They expressly prohibit law enforcement from enforcing the ban.

Legal experts say the ordinance is both unconstitutional and unenforceable. Put simply, Texas cannot dictate the behavior of its residents outside of Texas — in the same way Texans can travel to Las Vegas to gamble and Colorado to purchase cannabis.

“There’s a laundry list of legal issues… they just do not have that authority,” senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas David Donatti said. “If a person travels to New Mexico, for example, Amarillo can’t use a backdoor way of prohibiting healthcare access in New Mexico because that is an extraterritorial prohibition on conduct, which local governments are expressly forbidden from doing under the Texas Local Government Code.”

The day after Mark Lee Dickson advocated for Lubbock County’s ordinance, he drove up the Panhandle to Amarillo, where the city council considered a similar ordinance Tuesday.

They are considering joining at least four localities that preceded Lubbock in passing a similar ban — including Cochran, Mitchell, and Goliad counties, as well as the City of Odessa.

“Hopefully, we’ll see by the end of the year the city of Amarillo become a sanctuary for the unborn,” Dickson said. “Until abortion is outlawed from coast to coast, we’ve got a lot of work to do.”"
Nov 07 2023,Voting is underway in Ohio with voters weighing abortion rights and marijuana,Ohio Capital Journal,left,https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/briefs/voting-is-underway-in-ohio-with-voters-weighing-abortion-rights-and-marijuana,"Ohioans got a mild, sunny Election Day to weigh in on two major statewide ballot measures as well as local offices. But while rain and snow aren’t going to deter voters this year, voting rights advocates described a handful of challenges Tuesday morning.

What’s on the ballot?

Around the state, voters will decide whether to protect reproductive rights with a constitutional amendment (Issue 1) and whether state law should allow recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older (Issue 2).

Regionally, voters in Cincinnati will decide whether to approve the sale of a city-owned railway to Norfolk Southern (Issue 22). Columbus voters will consider levies for the school district (Issue 11) and local libraries (Issue 16). In Cleveland, the so-called people’s budget initiative asks voters whether to set aside 2% of the annual budget for resident-proposed projects (Issue 38).

Hiccups

In a press conference Tuesday morning, a coalition of voting rights groups highlighted hurdles some voters were facing. Nazek Hapasha from the League of Women Voters brought up absentee ballots. “Especially a particularly high number of students that never received their mail ballot,” she explained.

“I have the names of at least two out of state students that just haven’t been able to vote in this election although they did everything correctly, because they’re not able to get home to vote,” she explained. “I know someone drove up from the University of Cincinnati, all the way to Upper Arlington to cast their ballot because they never got their ballot at the University of Cincinnati.”

If you didn't receive your absentee ballot, you can vote with a provisional ballot at your polling place on Election Day! Bring a photo ID. Polls are open 11/7 6:30am-7:30pm https://t.co/30LTBfVVzI You vote will count once your BOE verifies you did not return an absentee ballot pic.twitter.com/iclhzcvjTh — Ohio Voter Rights Coalition (@votercoalition) November 6, 2023

Voters who never received an absentee ballot can still vote provisionally on Election Day. The board will count that vote once they verify the voter didn’t send in the absentee ballot. Voters who got their ballot but missed the Monday postmark deadline, can also vote provisionally at their polling place or hand-deliver the ballot to the county board of elections.

Importantly, voters cannot drop off absentee ballots at their polling location.

Looking ahead, Collin Marozzi explained the four-day cure period falls on Veterans Day. Some provisional voters, for instance those without photo ID, have to bring proof of identity to the county board within that timeframe to validate their ballot.

“County boards of election must be open for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week, however, they need to post a sign on their property saying that their offices will be closed in observance of Veterans Day on Saturday,” he explained. “That kicks the fourth and final day of our cure period to actually Monday, November 13, and that is actually the last day that mail in ballots as well can be received by the board of elections.”

Kayla Griffin from All Voting is Local described a ballot scanner going down in Shaker Heights Tuesday morning, but she said a technician responded quickly and the polling place still had one scanner working.

The polls close at 7:30 Tuesday night. So long as voters are in line by then, they have the right to vote.

Dec 11 2023,"Texas woman who sought court permission for abortion leaves state for the procedure, attorneys say",Arizona's Family,center,https://azfamily.com/2023/12/11/attorneys-pregnant-texas-woman-who-challenged-states-abortion-ban-has-left-her-state-get-procedure,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal condition left the state to get an abortion elsewhere before the state Supreme Court on Monday rejected her unprecedented challenge of one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S.

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had spent nearly a week seeking court permission in Texas to end her pregnancy, but her attorneys said she could not wait any longer and left the state. Her baby has a condition known as trisomy 18, which has low survival rates, and her lawsuit argued that continuing the pregnancy jeopardized both her health and ability to have more children.

Texas’ abortion ban makes narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger but not for fetal anomalies. Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton argued that Cox had not shown that any of the complications in her pregnancy rose to the level of threatening her life.

“Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which was representing Cox.

The organization did not disclose where Cox went. On Monday, she would have been 20 weeks and six days pregnant.

Hours after Cox’s attorneys announced she had left Texas, the state Supreme Court issued its decision that ruled against Cox. It came three days after the court temporarily halted a lower judge’s ruling that gave Cox permission to get an abortion.

“No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn child’s trisomy 18 diagnosis,” the court wrote. “Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses.”

Cox, who lives in the Dallas area, was believed to be the first woman in the U.S. to ask a court for permission for an abortion since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. Her lawsuit quickly became a high-profile test of bans in Texas and a dozen other GOP-controlled states, where abortion is prohibited at nearly all stages of pregnancy.

Days after Cox filed her lawsuit, a pregnant woman in Kentucky also asked a court to allow an abortion. There has been no ruling yet in that case.

In Texas, Paxton mounted an aggressive defense to try to prevent Cox from having an abortion. He sent three Houston hospitals letters warning of legal consequences — both criminal and civil — if they allowed Cox’s physician to provide the procedure. He also argued that Cox had not demonstrated that her life was at imminent risk, including noting that she was sent home after her multiple visits to emergency rooms.

Cox had cesarean surgeries during her first two pregnancies. Her lawsuit argued that inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior C-sections, and that another one at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child. But Paxton contended those arguments still fell short.

“Rather, the only question is whether Ms. Cox’s condition meets the exception, regardless of how long the child is expected to live,” Paxton’s office told the court in a filing over the weekend.

Dr. Leilah Zahedi-Spung, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Colorado and a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health, said when lethal fetal anomalies are diagnosed “there’s only risk to that pregnant person and no benefit unfortunately for that innocent child.”

“You are putting your body through risks without any benefit because prolonging the pregnancy doesn’t change the survival rate,” Zahedi-Spung said.

Doctors told Cox that her fetus has a condition known as trisomy 18, which is when a baby has an extra copy of chromosome 18. The diagnosis has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth, and low survival rate. Doctors told Cox that inducing labor or carrying the baby to term could jeopardize her ability to have another child.

Trisomy 18 occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 diagnosed pregnancies, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. There is no live birth in about 70% of pregnancies involving the diagnosis that proceed past 12 weeks gestational age, according to a legal filing that the two groups submitted to the court.

The termination of pregnancies because of fetal anomalies or other often-fatal medical problems is seldom discussed in national debates over abortion. There are no recent statistics on the frequency of terminations for fetal anomalies in the U.S. but experts say it’s a small percentage of total procedures.

Texas has long been at the forefront of strict abortion laws in the U.S., and even now, there are ongoing efforts to make it harder for pregnant women to leave Texas for states where the procedure is legal. This year, a federal judge in Texas ruled that the bans do not apply to helping women get abortions out of state.

Under Texas’ bans, doctors who provide an abortion can face criminal charges that carry punishments of up to life in prison. They could also face lawsuits from private citizens, who are empowered to sue a person who helps a woman obtain an abortion, such as the doctor’s staff. The laws do not threaten the mother with any legal consequences.

Dr. Christina Bourne, medical director for abortion provider Trust Women, which provides abortion care in Wichita, Kansas, and also has a clinic in Oklahoma City, said that whether someone’s life is at risk can be subjective.

Doctors are now operating in a confusing atmosphere, Bourne said,

“If you are a pregnant person in a legally restrictive state, I am concerned about your health outcomes,” she said.

Dec 11 2023,Kate Cox goes out of state for abortion after Texas AG blocks medical exception,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/2023/12/11/kate-cox-texas-abortion-out-of-state,"A Texas woman whose emergency exception for an abortion was blocked by the state’s attorney general has left the state to undergo the procedure legally.

Kate Cox, a mother of two from the Dallas area who is roughly 20 weeks pregnant, learned late last month that her fetus has trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition that causes severe abnormalities and organ defects. The disorder, also called Edwards Syndrome, is often fatal before birth or within the first year of life.

Cox and her husband sought a court order to end the unviable pregnancy, which her doctors recommended to protect her current health and future fertility. A district judge granted the request on Thursday but state attorney general Ken Paxton immediately appealed to the state supreme court and argued her situation did not meet the criteria for a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban. The state supreme court paused the district court’s ruling on Friday

Texas bans abortion except in limited circumstances, such as if the mother’s life is threatened.

While trisomy 18 poses health risks and complications to a pregnant person, Paxton claimed Cox had not sufficiently argued she would suffer “immediate and irreparable injury” without an abortion, according to NBC News.

Cox’s doctors said inducing labor or carrying the baby to term may jeopardize her ability to get pregnant in the future.

However, the family plans to press their case in Texas with the state’s highest court and could take their appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, with no guarantee they would take the case.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate. Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said.

“She desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family,” Northup said. “While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”"
Dec 11 2023,"Pregnant Texas woman at the center of a legal battle leaves the state to obtain an abortion, attorneys say",CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/12/11/us/pregnant-texas-woman-at-the-center-of-a-legal-battle-leaves-the-state-to-obtain-an-abortion-attorneys-say/index.html,"CNN —

The Texas Supreme Court on Monday reversed a lower court’s ruling that would have allowed a woman to obtain an abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception, though the woman’s attorneys hours earlier said she had left the state to have the procedure.

Kate Cox sought the abortion after learning her fetus has a fatal condition and doctors told her she could risk her future fertility if she doesn’t get the procedure. A state judge last week ruled Cox, who is 21 weeks pregnant, could terminate her pregnancy — but the Texas Supreme Court temporarily put that ruling on hold late Friday.

On Monday, the Center for Reproductive Rights announced the 31-year-old mother had left Texas to get health care elsewhere following what the group that represents Cox described as “a week of legal whiplash.”

Then, hours later, the state’s high court ruled against her.

The ruling calls into question whether the decision could deter women in similar situations from seeking a court-authorized abortion. Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by a person seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.

While the center did not disclose more details of Cox’s plans, she had received “offers to help her access abortion elsewhere, from Kansas to Colorado to Canada,” its statement said.

Cox wants her care “the fastest way” possible, her attorney said.

The ‘medical emergency’ exception

On Thursday, a state district court judge sided with Cox and granted a temporary restraining order against the state so she could legally have an abortion under the state’s “medical emergency” exception. Texas has a near-complete abortion ban with narrow exceptions.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, quickly threatened criminal prosecution against doctors or hospitals who would help facilitate the abortion, saying they could face charges even after the 14-day temporary restraining order. CNN has reached out to Paxton’s office for comment.

Late Friday night, the state’s high court temporarily blocked Cox from obtaining an abortion while it reviewed the case.

In its ruling late Monday, the Texas Supreme Court – comprised of nine Republicans – called on the state’s medical board to provide more guidance on the “medical emergency” exception at the heart of Cox’s case.

The high court also released an opinion, saying Cox’s doctor did not establish or attest that Cox’s symptoms were life-threatening and noting it should be up to doctors – not judges – to decide whether to provide an abortion.

“No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn (fatal condition) diagnosis. Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” the opinion states.

“The exception requires a doctor to decide whether Ms. Cox’s difficulties pose such risks,” the ruling continues. “(A doctor) asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”

A separate case pending before the Texas Supreme Court seeks clarity on the “medical emergency” exception. Notably, in its opinion, the court called on the Texas Medical Board to provide further guidance on the law.

“The courts cannot go further by entering into the medical-judgment arena. The Texas Medical Board, however, can do more to provide guidance in response to any confusion that currently prevails,” the opinion states. “Each of the three branches of government has a distinct role, and while the judiciary cannot compel executive branch entities to do their part, it is obvious that the legal process works more smoothly when they do.”

Fears for woman’s health and future fertility

For Cox, “this past week of legal limbo has been hellish,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. “Her health is on the line. She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.

“This is why judges and politicians should not be making health care decisions for pregnant people – they are not doctors.”

Texas’ “medical emergency” exception allows for an abortion if the mother has a “life-threatening” physical condition while pregnant or has “a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”

Critics argue the statute is too vague and has a chilling effect on doctors who fear criminal prosecution.

The same legal group representing Cox – the Center for Reproductive Rights – is also representing a group of women and physicians before the Texas Supreme Court in the lawsuit seeking clarity. The state argues the law is adequate.

Cox has been to the emergency room four times in the last month due to symptoms like severe cramping, diarrhea, leaking of fluid and elevated vital signs, her attorney said. And because she’s already delivered two children via C-section, her physicians have warned she is at high risk for complications, including possible uterine rupture in future pregnancies.

This pregnancy would need to be delivered via another C-section, which Cox fears could jeopardize her health and future fertility, her attorneys said.

Additionally, the fetus has trisomy 18, a fatal genetic condition sometimes called Edwards syndrome that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In at least 95% of cases, the fetus doesn’t survive full-term and the pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Paxton argued Cox has not established her symptoms as to meet the “life-threatening” criteria in the law.

The filing from his office stated Cox inquired about getting an abortion only after learning her fetus might not survive the pregnancy or long afterward and already knew she might need another C-section before her current pregnancy.

“Plaintiffs plead no facts linking Ms. Cox’s physical condition related to the birth of this child to the loss of fertility. Instead, it appears she will face the same risks regarding the birth of any future child,” the filing states.

State says doctor’s opinion ‘is not enough’

As his office has done in the broader case on this issue before the state Supreme Court, Paxton’s attorneys also argued “a fatal fetal condition does not meet the medical exception,” adding the exception applies only to the mother’s condition.

Paxton’s office also said none of the physicians who have treated Cox in the Dallas-Fort Worth area have recommended an abortion.

Dr. Damla Karsan, a Houston-based physician – and a plaintiff in the other case – is cited in legal filings as having reviewed Cox’s medical records, recommended the abortion and agreed to provide the medical care.

The state wrote in the filing Karsan’s recommendation “is not enough.”

“What he’s (Paxton) saying is that physicians in Texas shouldn’t be practicing medicine,” said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Ken Paxton is practicing medicine – because that’s what he wants – he wants to review her medical records. He wants to decide if he thinks she’s sick enough.

“When people tout the medical exceptions to abortion bans as meaning that the abortion bans are OK, and that people who really need care are still getting it, that’s a lie.”

The case shows why “it is completely untenable for patients to have to come to court and ask for court authorization for lifesaving medical care,” she said. “It’s simply outrageous and people should be outraged but what is happening in Texas right now.”

UPDATE, 12/11/23 at 2:15 p.m.: A week after Texas resident Kate Cox filed a petition seeking an emergency abortion due to a severe fetal condition, the Center for Reproductive Rights confirmed on Monday afternoon that the mother of two is now being forced to travel out-of-state for care. A lower court judge initially offered Cox a temporary restraining order from Texas’ total abortion ban on Thursday, but by Friday evening, the Texas Supreme Court blocked this temporary restraining order. Now, 20 weeks into her pregnancy, Cox must seek care elsewhere.

“This past week of legal limbo has been hellish for Kate,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO at the Center, said in a statement. “She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer.” Northrup traced Texas’ brutal mistreatment of Cox to the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade: “This is the result of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe: women are forced to beg for urgent healthcare in court. Kate’s case has shown the world that abortion bans are dangerous for pregnant people, and exceptions don’t work.”

Northrup continued, “[Cox] desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family. While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”

Last week, Kate Cox, a mother of two in Texas, filed an emergency lawsuit to access urgent abortion care 20 weeks into her pregnancy due to a fetal diagnosis that threatens her life and her future fertility. Travis County Judge Maya Guerra Gamble heard Cox’s story and, through tears, granted Cox’s request for a temporary restraining order from Texas’ abortion ban that would allow health care providers to offer her an emergency abortion, without the threat of jail or fines. But late Friday night, Texas did what it does best: endanger pregnant people’s lives and reject their pleas for life-saving, basic care. The state is holding Cox’s health, safety, and fertility hostage for political theater.

“In this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights representing Cox, said in a statement following the Texas Supreme Court’s decision to temporarily halt the judge’s ruling. “We are talking about urgent medical care. Kate is already 20 weeks pregnant. This is why people should not need to beg for healthcare in a court of law.”

Cox’s suit specifically asks that the court allow her OB/GYN, Dr. Damla Karsan, to provide her with an abortion without facing the threat of prosecution. (Karsan is a plaintiff in a separate ongoing lawsuit also filed by the Center asking Texas to clarify the medical emergency exception of the state’s abortion ban.) It also marks the first time an individual’s had to sue for the right to an abortion since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973.

The 31-year-old has already been rushed to the ER four times, according to her attorneys, but doctors kept saying their hands were tied due to Texas’ stringent abortion ban, and sent her home. Under current law, health care providers in Texas face the threat of life in prison, a $100,000 fine, and loss of their medical license if they provide an abortion that appears to run afoul of the state’s dangerously ambiguous guidelines. On Thursday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatened to unleash all of these penalties against any doctor who helped Cox.

“Fearmongering has been Ken Paxton’s main tactic in enforcing these abortion bans,” Duane wrote in a statement shared with Jezebel last Thursday. She further accused Paxton of “misrepresenting the court’s order” and “trying to bulldoze the legal system to make sure Kate and pregnant women like her continue to suffer.”

Friday’s late-night action came after Paxton warned three different hospitals in Cox’s community that the state would take legal action—including fines and prosecution—if any of them offered Cox emergency care. It’s also worth noting that, in 2012, one of the state’s Supreme Court judges, Justice John Devine, boasted about being arrested 37 times for protesting and blocking abortion clinics.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Gamble said in her opinion. Per Cox’s lawsuit, she recently received confirmation that her baby has Trisomy 18, a condition where the fetus has almost no chance of survival, and places Cox at risk of severe health complications, death, and infertility. Cox’s options were to continue her pregnancy until she gives birth to a baby that could live only minutes, while jeopardizing her own health, or travel out-of-state for the procedure.

“It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when. I’m trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer,” Cox said in a press release shared with Jezebel after filing the emergency lawsuit. “I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy. I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy. I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer. I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health and a future pregnancy.”

Despite the urgency of Cox’s situation, and Duane’s assertion at the Thursday hearing that “no one knows” what the Texas abortion ban’s medical exception entails and that “the state won’t tell us,” an attorney representing the state responded with shocking cruelty. Johnathan Stone, a lawyer with the Texas attorney general’s office, said that because Cox would not suffer “immediate and irreparable injury,” she doesn’t qualify. Stone inexplicably argued that “the only party that’s going to suffer an immediate and irreparable harm,” should Cox get an abortion, is “the state [Texas].” After the hearing, Duane called Stone’s arguments “stunning.”

“They have… revealed their true position all along: Only when a woman is about to die—or even when it’s too late—can abortion be allowed in the state of Texas,” Duane said. “In other words, these medical exceptions are no real exception at all.”

Cox’s lawsuit places front and center the brutality of Texas’ laws, and demonstrates how abortion bans compound the physical and emotional trauma of nonviable, life-threatening pregnancies by forcing people to essentially beg for life-saving care—then tell them no. Unsurprisingly, this isn’t even the only lawsuit against Texas’ abortion ban, as the Texas Supreme Court prepares to rule on Zurawski v. Texas, the aforementioned suit filed by the Center on behalf of 20 women who were denied emergency abortions for life-threatening, nonviable pregnancies. Their suit asks the state to clarify the ban’s exception which supposedly allows someone to receive abortion care when their life is at risk, but hasn’t helped women in practice. Cox contacted the Center shortly after learning about the women’s lawsuit.

“Every day, people like Kate are suffering under these dangerous bans and the state of Texas is choosing to let it happen,” Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center, said in a statement. “Women like Kate should not be forced to go to court to protect her health and preserve her future fertility.”"

That means most abortions will continue to be banned once a doctor can detect fetal cardiac activity, typically around six weeks of pregnancy and before many know they are pregnant, while the Fulton County Superior Court considers other arguments made by abortion advocates and providers about why the restrictions should be lifted, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Dec 11 2023,Whitmer nixes extra insurance coverage for abortions 10 years after GOP passed mandate,Detroit News,center,https://detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/11/gretchen-whitmer-nixes-rape-insurance-rider-mandate-abortion-10-years-republican-michigan-law/71877632007,"Lansing — Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation Monday on the Senate floor removing restrictions on health insurance coverage of abortion exactly ten years to the day after she railed against the Republicans-authored restrictions as Senate minority leader.

Whitmer's speech in 2013 opposing the legislation requiring women to pay for an additional insurance rider for abortion coverage gained widespread attention as she shared her story of being raped in college publicly for the first time.

The assault did not result in a pregnancy, but the East Lansing Democrat said the law left other rape survivors who became pregnant potentially without insurance coverage to terminate the pregnancy.

During her December 11, 2013 speech, Whitmer said the law effectively required to women to purchase ""rape insurance"" to cover an abortion in the event they were sexually assaulted.

Requiring women to purchase extra health insurance coverage for abortions, Whitmer said Monday, was ""a dangerous and preposterous bill and they knew it.""

""While this isn't about me, it is personal to me and so many Michigan women,"" Whitmer said.

Whitmer signed the repeal of the law she railed against ten years ago on the Senate floor inside the Senate's chamber, an unusual place for a governor to sign legislation.

Rep. Laurie Pohutsky, a Livonia Democrat who was a lead sponsor on the package of abortion-related bills, said the signing of the legislation underscores Michigan's commitment to bodily autonomy.

""We are saying definitively that Michigan is a state that values and protects the right of every person to determine their own reproductive future,"" Pohutsky said.

Pohutsky said Monday ""the work isn't over"" and that there are other abortion measures unable to move through the Legislature in recent months that could see further legislative debate or litigation.

The Michigan Catholic Conference criticized the signing of the legislation, arguing the measures go beyond what the status quo voters were promised when they supported a year ago with the passage of Proposal 3, which enshrined abortion rights into the state constitution.

""While voters were told they would only be protecting the legality of abortion as it had been regulated under Roe v. Wade, the abortion lobby has leveraged passage of the new constitutional amendment to make Michigan an extreme outlier on abortion policy, far beyond what was status quo under Roe,"" said Rebecca Mastee, policy advocate for the Michigan Catholic Conference.

The bill signed Monday is the flagship legislation in a nine-bill package that removes several regulations on abortion in the wake of voters' passage of a ballot initiative last year that enshrined abortion in the state constitution.

The bill puts the language of the Reproductive Freedom for All constitutional amendment, Proposal 3, into state law and makes several additional repeals and changes to existing state law. It is tie-barred to eight separate bills that were signed into law last month.

Advocates of the legislation argue it codifies the changes introduced through the proposal. But opponents said it repeals common sense restrictions that ensure the health of women, such as surgical center mandates and a state-level partial birth abortion ban. A federal ban on partial birth abortion remains in place.

The bills signed last month largely repealed requirements for abortion clinics to be licensed as freestanding surgical centers in Michigan. Supporters of the repeal say they put unecessary and onerous building code restrictions on abortion clinics. The laws have been referred to as ""TRAP laws,"" which stands for targeted restrictions on abortion providers.

The bill signed Monday inserts the language of the constitutional amendment into state law, repeals Michigan's partial birth abortion ban in full and voids a 92-year-old law that criminalizes the abortion of a ""quick child"" or a child that has started moving in the womb. The bill also nixes laws that require insurance providers to make customers pay for an additional rider for abortion coverage.

Supporters of the legislation were not able to get the full suite of repeals they wanted, in part due to at least one Democratic lawmaker who felt some of the measures went too far. Those repeals that aren't in the package include a repeal of a ban on Medicaid funding for abortions, a repeal of mandatory screening for coercion and and a repeal of the state's 24-hour waiting period ahead of an abortion.

The package of bills also did not include a repeal of the state's parental consent requirements for an abortion being sought by a minor, though prior versions of the legislation included it.

Pohutsky said those measures could see new life in the form of further legislative debate or litigation in the coming year. The prospect of litigation has been the subject of some controversy, as supporters of Proposal 3 last November dismissed concerns from opponents that the absolute constitutional right to abortion would nullify many Michigan's abortion regulations, such as the parental consent law.

Pohutsky, when asked whether the constitutional amendment conflicts with some of those laws, responded that there's a ""solid argument to be made.""

""A right is not actually a right if it is not accessible,"" Pohutsky told reporters. ""There are still laws that are unfortunately on the books that do inhibit that right for people. I think that that's a solid argument to be made.""

Oct 24 2023,Reactions to Georgia Supreme Court's ruling on abortion ban,Fox 5 Atlanta,center,https://fox5atlanta.com/news/reactions-to-georgia-supreme-courts-ruling-on-abortion-ban,"The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a lower court ruling that the state's restrictive abortion law was invalid, leaving limited access to abortions unchanged for now.

Several reactions to that ruling have been released or posted on social media:

Gov. Brian Kemp released the following statement:

""I applaud Justice Colvin and the Georgia Supreme Court for ruling today that our written Constitution controls over judge-made law. Today’s victory represents one more step towards ending this litigation and ensuring the lives of Georgians at all ages are protected.""

SisterSong, which is the organization that filed the challenge, had this to say:

U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff issued the following statement:

""The State of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban — one of the most extreme in the nation — strips women of autonomy in the most personal health decisions.

""More than half of Georgia counties have no OB/GYN, and we have one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.

""Georgia’s extreme abortion ban risks worsening our state’s women’s health crisis.

""I again call on Georgia’s state legislature and the Governor to repeal this extreme abortion ban.""

National Right to Life sent the following statement:

""We are forever thankful for the political will shown by Georgia’s pro-life elected officials including Governor Brian Kemp, Senator Ed Setzler, Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson, and Senator Renee Unterman (ret.) who all fought for the LIFE Act’s passage in 2019,"" stated Claire Bartlett, executive director of Georgia Life Alliance.

Congresswoman Nikema Williams (GA-05), vice-chair of the Democratic Women’s Caucus and a member of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus said:

""Today’s decision to allow the extreme Republican abortion ban to stand harms Georgians, but it isn’t the last word. I am fighting in Congress every day to protect our reproductive freedom because abortion is essential healthcare. It is time to ensure abortion access is codified into federal law and affordable for all–no matter their ZIP Code, no matter their bank account.""

Nov 16 2023,Nebraska group launches ballot initiative to enshrine abortion in state constitution,ABC 8 KLKN,center,https://klkntv.com/nebraska-group-launches-ballot-initiative-to-enshrine-abortion-in-state-constitution,"Group launches ballot initiative to enshrine abortion rights in Nebraska Constitution

LINCOLN, Neb. (KLKN) – Earlier this month, voters in Ohio added a right to abortion to their state’s constitution.

Now that fight comes to Nebraska.

On Thursday, the group Protect our Rights held a rally in Omaha to launch the campaign for a similar 2024 ballot initiative.

“Personal health care decisions should always be made with the patient and that individual in consulting with their doctor, not the government,” said Ashlei Spivey, executive director of I Be Black Girl. “This campaign is about giving Nebraskans the power to make those decisions.”

The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the patient.

Under the proposal, the patient’s health care practitioner would determine fetal viability, which is usually around 23 to 24 weeks.

Sandy Danek, president and executive director of Nebraska Right to Life, said that language is vague.

“The concern with that is that the courts have defined health so broadly that basically any reason can be acceptable,” she said. “And most concerning is it’s left to the discretion of the person who’s performing the procedure.”

Advocates of the amendment say states with stricter abortion laws have a hard time recruiting health care professionals.

“Nebraska is already facing an OBGYN shortage,” supporter Mary Kinyoun said. “Reproductive health care deserts are growing in this state, while counties with OBGYNs are shrinking.”

The petition will need 125,000 valid signatures before it can go on the ballot in 2024.

In May, the Nebraska Legislature approved a 12-week abortion ban, which was quickly signed by Gov. Jim Pillen.

The governor said Wednesday that the 12-week ban was “common sense.”

“This petition has no place in Nebraska, and we will fight it with everything we have,” he said."
Nov 16 2023,Nebraska abortion rights advocates launch petition drive for 2024 ballot,Omaha World-Herald,center,https://omaha.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/nebraska-abortion-rights-advocates-launch-petition-drive-for-2024-ballot/article_2f80db5a-84a0-11ee-abe8-4732bf1a9395.html,"Thirteen weeks into her second pregnancy, Abby Waller of Omaha found out that a tumor and a heart defect meant that her child likely wouldn’t survive to term.

Since this happened in 2020, Waller said she was able to have an abortion. But because of a new Nebraska law that bans abortions after 12 weeks based on gestational age, without an exception for fetal anomalies, Waller said she would not have that same option today.

“This shouldn’t be the government’s decision to make,” Waller said.

Waller is one of several supporters of a new ballot initiative effort to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution. She, along with other advocates with the Protect Our Rights coalition, spoke about the initiative at an event Thursday kicking off its petition drive.

The initiative proposes a constitutional amendment that would protect legal abortion care until “fetal viability,” which differs with each pregnancy but is generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks gestational age. If the petition garners roughly 122,000 valid signatures — including 5% of registered voters in at least 38 counties — by July 2024, the question will be added to the 2024 general election ballot.

“It’s going to take a lot of work for us to get this on the ballot,” said Andi Curry Grubb, state executive director of Planned Parenthood of North Central States. “And we are absolutely ready to meet that challenge.”

The proposed policy language does not set a specific timeline for when abortion would be illegal under the amendment, but defines fetal viability as “the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.”

The amendment would also ensure abortions are available “when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions.”

This language immediately spurred criticism from anti-abortion groups and state officials, including State Sen. Joni Albrecht of Thurston — who has proposed abortion bans in the last two years — and Gov. Jim Pillen. In a written statement, Pillen said the initiative would “radically expand abortion” in Nebraska, up until 39 weeks of pregnancy.

“There’s no Nebraskans that are going to support that petition, and we’re going to make sure that they understand the truth of the language in there,” Pillen said at a Wednesday press conference.

Curry Grubb accused Pillen and other opponents of spreading lies about the campaign. She described the initiative as narrowly tailored and an effort to restore in Nebraska the same abortion rights that existed before the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.

Dr. Mary Kinyoun, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Omaha, added that abortions don’t happen in Nebraska at 39 weeks and wouldn’t even be considered an abortion at that stage.

“That is not an abortion, sir, that’s called a delivery,” she said.

In recent weeks, hundreds of volunteers signed on to aid the initiative, said Ashlei Spivey, executive director of I Be Black Girl. This indicates to her that — despite Pillen’s assertions — the campaign’s message falls in line with what many Nebraskans want. She said the campaign plans to start circulating petitions as early as next week.

Earlier this year, lawmakers passed a bill that tightened the state’s abortion restrictions from 20 weeks post-fertilization to 12 weeks based on gestational age. Since then, Pillen and other officials have signaled their intent to push for further restrictions, potentially up to a full ban.

This year’s bill took effect immediately upon Pillen’s signature. It has been challenged in court because the law affected both abortions and gender-affirming care options for individuals under 19. The legal challenge — currently pending in the State Supreme Court — claims the law violated the Nebraska Constitution’s single-subject rule.

Spivey said measuring abortion restrictions by weeks — whether 12 or 20 — is arbitrary and doesn’t recognize the nuances that exist in every pregnancy. This was a primary reason why the coalition framed its ballot language around fetal viability.

“Every patient, and every pregnancy is different,” Kinyoun said.

The proposed Nebraska petition uses language that is similar to the constitutional amendment that Ohio voters supported last week, though Spivey said Nebraska’s initiative wasn’t copied from that measure nor any other state’s successful ballot initiative.

After Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, voters in California, Michigan and Vermont passed ballot measures protecting abortion rights in their state constitutions. In Kentucky, Kansas and Montana, voters rejected measures that would have made it easier for lawmakers to increase abortion restrictions.

Following those elections, Nebraska abortion rights advocates have suggested that Nebraska voters might follow suit if they had a vote on abortion, and State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston cited the outcome of the Kansas initiative as a reason for casting the deciding vote to block a bill that would have banned abortions at six weeks gestation.

LOUIS (AP) — Missouri lawmakers intended to “impose their religious beliefs on everyone” in the state when they passed a restrictive abortion ban, lawyers for a group of religious leaders who support abortion rights said at a court hearing Thursday.

But attorneys for the state countered that just because some supporters of the law oppose abortion on religious grounds doesn’t mean that the law forces their beliefs on anyone else.

Thirteen Christian, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist leaders filed suit in January seeking a permanent injunction barring Missouri from enforcing its abortion law and a declaration that provisions violate the Missouri Constitution. Thursday’s hearing in St. Louis concerned the state’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. Judge Jason Sengheiser said he’ll likely rule in January.

The Missouri lawsuit is one of 38 filed in 23 states challenging restrictive abortion laws enacted after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The landmark ruling left abortion rights up to each state to decide.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the faith leaders by Americans United for Separation of Church & State and the National Women’s Law Center, said sponsors and supporters of the Missouri measure “repeatedly emphasized their religious intent in enacting the legislation.”

The lawsuit quotes the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Nick Schroer, as saying that “as a Catholic I do believe life begins at conception and that is built into our legislative findings.” A co-sponsor, Republican state Rep. Barry Hovis, said he was motivated “from the Biblical side of it,” according to the lawsuit.

“We know this has a religious purpose because when the lawmakers passed the law 2019, they told us that,” said K.M. Bell, an attorney for the plaintiffs.

But Maria Lanahan, Missouri’s deputy solicitor general, told the judge that lawmakers had varying reasons for supporting the law. She said that while the abortion ban “was in harmony” with the religious beliefs of some members of the Legislature, no one was “compelled to support any system of worship.”

Within minutes of last year’s Supreme Court decision, then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Gov. Mike Parson, both Republicans, filed paperwork to immediately enact a 2019 law prohibiting abortions “except in cases of medical emergency.” That law contained a provision making it effective only if Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The law makes it a felony punishable by five to 15 years in prison to perform or induce an abortion. Medical professionals who do so also could lose their licenses. The law says that women who undergo abortions cannot be prosecuted.

Missouri already had some of the nation’s more restrictive abortion laws and had seen a significant decline in the number of abortions performed, with residents instead traveling to clinics just across the state line in Illinois and Kansas.

Lawsuits in other states have taken similar approaches.

In Indiana, lawyers for five anonymous women — who are Jewish, Muslim and spiritual — and advocacy group Hoosier Jews for Choice argued that state’s ban infringes on their beliefs. Their lawsuit specifically highlights the Jewish teaching that a fetus becomes a living person at birth and that Jewish law prioritizes the mother’s life and health. A state appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments Dec. 6.

In Kentucky, three Jewish women sued, claiming the state’s ban violates their religious rights under the state’s constitution and religious freedom law. They allege that Kentucky’s Republican-dominated legislature “imposed sectarian theology” by prohibiting nearly all abortions.

Oct 06 2023,Anti-abortion advocates rally in downtown Columbus,NBC 4 WCMH,center,https://nbc4i.com/news/local-news/columbus/anti-abortion-advocates-rally-in-downtown-columbus,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – On Wednesday Ohioans will start heading to the polls for early voting in this November’s election.

Issue 1, this fall, is about reproductive rights and drew hundreds to the streets of Columbus on Friday.

Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted (R-Ohio) said the proposal is “too radical” for Ohio.

“There’s a lot of enthusiasm on the ground and the more people learn about Issue 1, the more they understand its dangers and why they need to vote ‘no,’” Press Secretary for Protect Women Ohio Amy Natoce said.

Issue 1 is a proposed constitutional amendment that would codify the right to abortion, up to the point of fetal viability in the state constitution.

“Right now, the issue is whether this is the right policy and I think that most people think this is the wrong policy,” Husted said.

The amendment would protect other reproductive healthcare rights too, like the right to contraception.

“We’re once again standing with Ohioans to tell out-of-touch politicians coming for our rights and freedoms that ‘we won’t go back,’” Chair of the Ohio Democratic Party Liz Walters said.

As campaigns ramp up, the “vote yes” side also said they have a lot of energy behind their message. But the “vote no” side says the proposed amendment is too broad — and some said they worry about how the law could be interpreted.

“It is true that this eliminates parental consent for your daughters and allows for late term abortions,” Husted said.

Abortions in Ohio are still legal as if we were still under Roe V. Wade. But Ohio does have a six-week abortion ban — called the Heartbeat Law — on the books. The law bans abortion at about six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. That law has been halted, though, and in court for nearly one year.

Most recently, the Ohio Supreme Court heard arguments about the hold on the law one week ago.

“One of the things about the constitutional amendment is it can only address one issue, so it does not address gender-affirming care, it does not address parental consent,” Representative Anita Somani (D-Dublin) said. “There are no late term abortions or partial birth abortions. Those are talking points on the right.”

But the “vote no” side said it’s important to keep having the debate about the right law in Ohio.

“If issue one passes, we will no longer be having debates about abortion law in Ohio. This will be codified in our constitution,” Natoce said. “Let’s defeat Issue 1 and let’s continue to have these hard conversations.”

Walters said voting yes on Issue 1 in November is about protecting women’s freedoms.

“What this does is establish a clear right for Ohio women to not have their rights threatened in any way,” Walter said.

If the amendment does pass in November, the state legislature will not be able to reverse it. The last day to register to vote is Oct. 10."
Dec 15 2023,"Kate Cox is one of hundreds in Texas denied abortions despite serious health risks, data show",STAT,center,https://www.statnews.com/2023/12/15/abortion-kate-cox-texas-health-risks-trisomy-18/,"A Texas woman’s unsuccessful legal fight for an abortion on medical emergency grounds drew nationwide headlines in recent days, but her plight is hardly a rare occurrence amid vague and highly restrictive state laws in the post-Roe era. Kate Cox is likely one of hundreds, if not thousands, of Texans who’ve faced a similar struggle this year to get an abortion for medical reasons, according to a STAT review of studies and abortion data from other states.

Over the first six months of this year, there were 34 legal abortions recorded in Texas, all of which were categorized as both “medical emergencies” and to “preserve the health of the woman,” in a state where abortions are only permitted under such circumstances. That figure, said physicians and researchers, is far below the number of patients who would typically need abortions to protect the health of the mother, suggesting many women have been forced to continue pregnancies despite the risks, or to travel out of state for abortions.

Just next door, the state of Oklahoma provides a benchmark: State data show 324 abortions were performed there because the physical health of the mother was at risk in 2021, the year before Oklahoma enacted its own abortion ban. The line between risk and crisis is blurred in the official statistics, but 59 abortions that year were necessary to avert the death of the mother, which is the narrowest possible interpretation of an emergency. Applying that rate to Texas, with a population more than seven times larger, the number of women facing death who needed abortions would exceed 400 a year, while close to 2,400 would likely face physical health risks.

Risks don’t always become imminently life-threatening, but strict definitions that separate the two are not easily applicable in health care. “Medicine is not black and white, there’s a lot of gray,” said Daniel Grossman, director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), a research group at the University of California, San Francisco. “Pregnancy itself is very dangerous and medical conditions can progress quickly during pregnancy in a way that’s very different from a non-pregnant state. There isn’t a moment necessarily where it’s clear the patient’s risk of dying is so high, it’s much more of a subjective assessment.”

Meanwhile, some 394 abortions in Oklahoma in 2021 were due to a possible problem with the health of the fetus, a concern shared by Cox, whose fetus carried a genetic disorder, trisomy 18, with an extremely low chance of survival.

Another indicator of the need for medically necessary abortions is a 2013 study of 954 abortions at 30 U.S. abortion facilities, which found some 6% were performed out of concern for the patient’s own health. In Texas, where 32,988 abortions were performed in the first six months of 2018 (before the state adopted a “heartbeat” law in 2019 that effectively banned abortion after six weeks of pregnancy), that would be equivalent to nearly 4,000 abortions a year.

“We can logically assume there are hundreds, if not thousands, of cases [of pregnancies that need to be terminated for health emergencies] in a state like Texas every year,” said Gretchen Ely, professor of social work at the University of Tennessee who studies reproductive health and health disparities.

The state, though, only started tracking reasons for abortions in September 2021, coinciding with its adoption of laws that permit abortion only in vaguely defined medical emergencies.

Erinma Ukoha, a maternal fetal medicine fellow at a New York hospital and a fellow with the advocacy group Physicians for Reproductive Health who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, said she discusses abortion as a possible treatment option with patients who have pregnancy-related health issues on a daily basis. “Pregnancy emergencies arise all the time,” she said.

The 34 Texas abortions in the first half of 2023, she said, don’t reflect the true number of pregnancies that needed to be terminated for medical reasons. Instead, she added, Texas has created a legal prohibition that often overrides physicians’ interpretation of emergency, as demonstrated by Cox’s recent lawsuit.

Continuing her pregnancy was potentially life-threatening, according to the suit, and risked making Cox permanently infertile, which Cox and her physician argued met the Texas definition of allowing abortion in cases where pregnancy will create “substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” While a lower court sided with her initially, the Texas Supreme Court refused to allow her to have an abortion, though it was deemed necessary by her doctor. She ended up traveling out of state to end the pregnancy.

“Even in cases where a physician believes there’s a medical indication, as we’ve seen in the case of Kate Cox, there’s so much uncertainty around what will retrospectively be perceived by the medical system as necessary,” said Deepshikha Ashana, medical professor at Duke University specializing in critical care.

Grossman recently published a report on reproductive care after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. He highlighted several cases of patients who faced immense medical risk but couldn’t get appropriate care in states with abortion restrictions.

Those who develop preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) in the second trimester, which happens in 0.4% to 0.7% of pregnancies, would have been offered abortions pre-Dobbs, because the fetus is unlikely to survive and the patient is at risk of infection. Now in these states, Grossman highlighted instances where physicians sent patients home, waiting for them to develop an infection which, in several cases, became severe and required ICU treatment.

In addition to PPROM, pregnancy also comes with risks including hemorrhaging, pre-eclampsia, and liver dysfunction, all of which can rapidly go from distressing to a life-or-death emergency.

Waiting for the threat of death to worsen is precarious for both doctors and patients, and emergency care typically works to prevent crises, said Hayley Gershengorn, an intensivist and health services researcher at the University of Miami. “If we’re waiting for people to be on the foothold of death, our ability is lessened.” Rather than wait for care, others with PPROM noted in Grossman’s report had to drive for several hours to receive treatment out of state. Such journeys are becoming increasingly common. Around half of abortions performed in Oklahoma in 2022 were for Texas residents, while others travel further.

Gershengorn said the journey significantly increases risk. ”To say they can just go somewhere else — it is not the case,” she said. “Forget financial resources and the logistics, which is a whole other story. To travel 500 miles when you’re on the verge of critical illness is risky, and people don’t always tolerate that.”

Both the need for travel and delays accessing care significantly exacerbate risks, said Andréa Becker, a postdoctoral research fellow at the ANSIRH research group, who’s published research showing maternal mortality is significantly worse in states with abortion restrictions and exacerbated for Black patients.

The lack of certainty around what constitutes enough risk to perform an abortion is, she said, a way to further deter abortions. “There’s a lot of ambiguity in the laws that were passed post-Dobbs and within this ambiguity doctors aren’t able to provide the standard of care,” she said. “There’s a chilling effect.”

Nov 15 2023,U.S. bishops approve voting guide that calls abortion ‘preeminent priority’,Catholic News Agency,right,https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/256025/us-bishops-approve-voting-guide-that-calls-abortion-preeminent-priority,"At last year’s fall assembly, however, the bishops voted to postpone a full revision until after the 2024 election, opting instead to limit revisions in 2023 to the guide’s introduction and “supplemental inserts” disseminated in parish bulletins nationwide.

“I think the underlying document has served us very, very well,” Lori said Wednesday. “It’s based on Catholic social teaching. It’s not based on one’s favorite political ideology. It’s rooted very much in the tradition of the Church.”

“I think it is important to recall the purpose of this, which is to help first and foremost individual members of the Church to form their consciences. Not simply to ask themselves, ‘Who’s my favorite candidate? Who do I like? What kind of ideology attracts me?’ But rather to step back and say, ‘What does my Church say? What does our tradition say about the public order and what is good and true and right and just?’”

“In these materials,” he emphasized, “the bishops do not tell Catholics for whom to vote or against whom to vote. Rather, we seek first and foremost to help Catholics to form their consciences through prayer, study, reflection, and dialogue so that they can discern with prudence their decisions about public life.”

Lori said the bishops made a “very deliberate decision” to “rewrite” the guide after the 2024 elections through what he described as a “very thought-through, detailed, consultative process,” adding that “one might even say it will be synodal,” a reference to Pope Francis’ call for a synodal Church characterized by greater dialogue, inclusion, and openness.

One of the newly approved bulletin inserts addresses the Church’s opposition to gender ideology. “We support the dignity of the human person, created male or female,” it reads, “therefore, we oppose a gender ideology that fails to recognize the difference and reciprocity between man and woman.”

Another bulletin insert, adopting language used in the bishops’ existing guide, stresses that “family — based on marriage between a man and a woman — is the first and most fundamental unit of society: a sanctuary for the creation and nurturing of children.” The insert goes on to say that traditional marriage “should be defended and strengthened, not redefined, undermined, or further distorted.”

‘A planet for people’

The bishops’ nearly unanimous approval of the revised introduction (93% voted to approve it) underscored both the gravity of abortion in the eyes of the Catholic Church and the powerful influence the issue continues to exert on American political life. Some Church observers expected more debate and a closer vote.

In his remarks to the media, Lori pushed back on the suggestion that the bishops’ revisions fail to place enough emphasis on climate change, an issue Pope Francis has highlighted in his encyclical Laudato Si’ and this year’s apostolic exhortation Laudato Deum.

“First, I would remind you that the vote was 225 to 11,” Lori said, referring to the vote on the new introduction.

(Story continues below)

“No. 2, if you look at Laudato Si’ and when [the pope] talks about integral human ecology, the earth is our common home, but it is the home of people. And certainly in our midst, there are people who are vulnerable for many, many different reasons. The reason we focus on the unborn as we do is because they are utterly voiceless and defenseless. And abortion is a direct taking of human life,” he said.

“I would also say that if you go to read what Pope Francis has said about abortion, it is said in far more stark terms that we have said it, and he would identify abortion as a primary instance of the throwaway culture. And so I think we have done our level best to reflect fully, fairly, and lovingly the magisterium of Pope Francis, to whom we are most, most grateful.”"

Daily Caller News Foundation

The Texas Supreme Court enjoined a decision by a lower court on Friday that would have permitted a woman to abort a pregnancy in violation of state law, according to court documents.

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old woman and mother of two children, sought and obtained a temporary injunction against the State of Texas for the enforcement of the Texas Heartbeat Act against her, with the law banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is usually at six weeks. The state Supreme Court stayed the temporary injunction on Friday pending a review of the merits of the case, according to the order.

“Without regard to the merits, the Court administratively stays the district court’s December 7, 2023 order,” the one-page order reads. “The petition for mandamus and motion for temporary relief remain pending before the Court.”

Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, had sought to obtain an abortion due to health complications, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR), which filed the case on Cox’s behalf. Cox’s “pregnancy had Trisomy 18—a condition causing multiple structural abnormalities—and had no chance of survival,” according to CRR, and “continuing to carry the pregnancy to term could jeopardize her health and future fertility.”

“Cox has already undergone two C-sections. If she was forced to stay pregnant, she would likely need a third, placing her at high risk for multiple serious medical conditions such as uterine rupture and hysterectomy,” CRR noted. “She and her husband wish to have more children, and undergoing another C-section to deliver this pregnancy would lessen the likelihood that she’d be able to safely have more children in the future.”

In the temporary injunction, Democratic Presiding Judge Maya Guerra Gamble of the District Court of Travis County, who was elected to her office, ruled that Cox’s “life, health, and fertility are currently at serious risk and she needs a dilation and evacuation (“D&E”) abortion immediately … The longer Ms. Cox stays pregnant, the greater the risks to her life.”

Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton of Texas, who is named as a defendant in the case, issued a press release on Thursday warning physicians that, were they to perform the abortion, they would risk both “civil and criminal liability,” including fines of up to $100,000 and first-degree felony prosecutions. His office also sent a letter to Houston-area hospitals where Karson works to warn them of such penalties if the abortion occurred at their facilities.

The Texas Supreme Court is currently considering another case, Zurawski v. State of Texas, regarding the scope of medical emergency exceptions to the state’s ban on abortions. The case was submitted to the court after oral arguments on Nov. 28, and a ruling is pending.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO WND READERS: Shortly after Hamas terrorists fired over 5,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel on Oct. 7 and then proceeded to attack the Jewish state by land, sea and air – torturing, burning, beheading and murdering well over a thousand people, including women, children and infants, and wounding and abducting hundreds more – world reaction was, in its own way, almost equally shocking.

For after the biggest one-day mass slaughter of Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, what followed was an outpouring of celebratory demonstrations, unbridled Jew-hatred, deliriously gleeful support for Hamas and bitter condemnation of the nation of Israel. Not just in the Arab-Muslim world, but throughout the Western world as well, including all across America.

Why? What is behind the explosion of anti-Israel, anti-Jewish, pro-terror sentiment in the United States, where Israel has long been one of America's closest friends and allies? Why are hordes of young ""woke"" LGBT demonstrators marching in support of Hamas – when Hamas wouldn't think twice about binding and blindfolding them and throwing them off the roof of a tall building – as they routinely do in the Muslim world?

It turns out there's one area of agreement that is so powerful, deep-seated and all-consuming that the vast differences between the deranged left and the murderous jihadists melt away into Kumbaya harmony.

All of this and much more is completely exposed in November's issue of WND's critically acclaimed monthly Whistleblower magazine, titled ISRAEL VS. GLOBAL JIHAD: How Jew-hatred, radical Islam and Leftism are pushing us toward World War III. Beyond a deeply insightful dive into why leftists are surging toward radical Islam – which hates and dreams of raping and butchering them – this Whistleblower issue includes fantastic articles by everyone from top Israeli analyst (and former Israel Defense Forces officer) Caroline Glick to Harvest Christian Fellowship's Pastor Greg Laurie on the current war in Israel and biblical prophecies regarding the End Times … which he says are now upon us.

Nov 24 2023,Swing State Judge Dismisses ‘Misleading’ Bid To Make Abortion A Constitutional Right,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/24/nevada-judge-dismisses-abortion-amendment,"A Nevada judge ruled against a “misleading” petition to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution Wednesday, claiming that it violates the “single subject rule.”

In October, the Coalition for Parents and Children (CPC) PAC filed a lawsuit against a petition by Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom (NRF) to put an amendment on the ballot that protects access to abortion and birth control, and prenatal and postpartum care, according to The Hill. Carson City District Court Judge James Russell said that he was dismissing the petition because it did not focus on just abortion and, therefore, violated the “single subject rule,” according to the ruling. (RELATED: Red State Supreme Court Deals Blow To Republicans In Crucial Abortion Ballot Case)

“This Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Petition embraces a multitude of subjects that amount to logrolling,” Russell wrote. “Subsection 1, alone, embraces the following subjects: prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage, and infertility care … Thus, it is improper to characterize these broad categories as a ‘single subject’ because there is no explanation as to how these provisions are functionally related.”

Abortion is currently legal in Nevada up to 24 weeks unless a doctor determines that it would be necessary to preserve the “life or health of the pregnant person,” according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services. Several states have introduced language for abortion amendments following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Nevada’s petition, however, would have barred the state from banning abortion until after viability but could not prevent doctors from performing an abortion after that point if they believed it would “protect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant individual.” NRF’s petition also states that the state has no right to interfere with “all matters relating to pregnancy, including, without limitation, prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, vasectomy, tubal ligation, abortion, abortion care, management of a miscarriage and infertility care.”

CPC argued in its lawsuit that including all of these rights and not focusing on just abortion was a direct violation of Nevada’s ballot requirements to keep petitions limited to one subject, according to court documents.

“This is the first successful legal challenge of this type of initiative in the country,” Jason Guinasso, attorney for CPC, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “The initiative violates Nevada law because it encompasses more than a single subject, is grossly misleading due, in part, to the ambiguity of what ‘reproductive freedom’ is purported to be and the abyss of subjects this proposed right encompasses.”

Russell further noted that the petition was misleading because the defendants did not clearly explain the legal meaning of “equality,” which was also listed as a supposed right.

“While the right to ‘equal protection’ is well established in American jurisprudence, it is unclear what the term ‘equality’ means legally,” Russell wrote, according to court documents. “Given the breadth of this petition, it is unclear how the Intervenor-Defendants could describe it accurately in 200 words, which further supports this Court’s conclusion that the Petition fails to embrace a single subject.”

NRF’s attorneys did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

Dec 08 2023,Texas AG Ken Paxton files petition aiming to block Kate Cox abortion authorization,Austin American-Statesman,center,https://statesman.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/12/08/texas-abortion-lawsuit-ken-paxton-files-petition-to-block-kate-cox-abortion-ruling/71854434007,"Less than 48 hours after a Travis County district judge issued a temporary restraining order on the state's abortion ban and authorized a woman with a fatal fetal diagnosis, Kate Cox, to terminate her pregnancy, the Texas Supreme Court put the ruling on hold.

The Supreme Court's administrative stay, issued late Friday night, temporarily blocks the lower court's Thursday order pending further review. The justices intend to consider Attorney General Ken Paxton's petition for writ of mandamus, filed late Thursday night, to reverse the district court's decision.

In his petition, Paxton argued the state would suffer an ""irreparable loss"" should Cox terminate her pregnancy.

""Because the life of an unborn child is at stake, the Court should require a faithful application of Texas statutes prior to determining that an abortion is permitted,"" Paxton's request reads.

Cox's attorney, Molly Duane, said the temporary hold keeps Cox from accessing urgently needed medical care.

“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement Friday night.

Cox was 20 weeks and three days pregnant as of Friday afternoon, according to her attorneys' response to Paxton's appeal. The attorney general's petition could have been deemed moot if Cox had obtained the abortion while the restraining order was still in effect, but that would have depended on interpretation, said Seema Mohapatra, a Southern Methodist University professor of health law.

Paxton's appeal could allow him to test his arguments against the restraining order when the Supreme Court takes up his petition. Those arguments were central to an advisory letter he sent Thursday to three Houston hospitals where Cox’s OB-GYN holds privileges, claiming that the judge's temporary restraining order would not shield the plaintiffs or the hospitals from criminal charges or fines.

“The TRO will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws, including first-degree felony prosecutions … and civil penalties of not less than $100,000 for each violation,” he wrote in the letter, which his office published in a news release Thursday afternoon.

Travis County state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, a Democrat, issued the temporary restraining order Thursday morning, and it explicitly bars the defendants in the case, including Paxton and the Texas Medical Board, and anyone “in active concert and participation” with them from enforcing Texas’s abortion bans and laws “as applied to Ms. Cox’s current pregnancy.”

Cox's fetus has trisomy 18, a deadly genetic condition. The Dallas-area mother of two has been admitted to emergency rooms four times in the past month — including one visit since the case was filed — after experiencing severe cramping and fluid leaks, attorney Molly Duane told the court Thursday. Several doctors have advised Cox that there is ""virtually no chance"" her baby will survive and that carrying the pregnancy to term would make it less likely that she will be able to carry another child in the future, according to the complaint.

In the letter to the Houston hospitals, Paxton argued that private residents could still sue the plaintiffs as allowed by Senate Bill 8, and civil or district attorneys could still enforce Texas' pre-Roe v. Wade abortion bans, also known as the ""1925 laws.""

He also stated that the restraining order would expire “long before the statute of limitations for Texas’ abortion laws expires,” seeming to imply that he could prosecute the plaintiffs retrospectively.

But there are holes in this argument, and Paxton isn’t the final authority on this issue, said Southern Methodist University law professor Joanna Grossman.

""Paxton doesn't decide what the TRO protects them from or doesn't protect them,"" Grossman, the Ellen K. Solender Endowed Chair in Women and the Law, told the American-Statesman. ""His M.O. is to make threats and be a bully and hope people are afraid that he actually is crazy enough to try to go after them. ... I don't think (his statement) is going to have that impact.""

In a response to Paxton's Thursday letter, an attorney for Cox said the attorney general was trying to circumvent the legal process through intimidation.

“Fearmongering has been Ken Paxton's main tactic in enforcing these abortion bans,” said Marc Hearron, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “Rather than respect the judiciary, he is misrepresenting the court’s order. He attacks the judge who rules against him as an 'activist judge.' He is trying to bulldoze the legal system to make sure Kate (Cox) and pregnant women like her continue to suffer.”

As discussed during the Thursday court hearing, the judge's order is a temporary measure that offers Cox and the other plaintiffs immediate relief in a situation that can’t wait for a more thorough, longer-term evidentiary hearing.

The Texas Supreme Court is currently weighing the broader questions raised in Cox's case in Zurawski v. Texas, a lawsuit the court heard Nov. 28. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the suit on behalf of 20 women who were denied abortions amid severe pregnancy complications, including several women whose babies, like Cox's, were diagnosed with lethal fetal conditions. Dr. Damla Karsan, Cox's OB-GYN, is also a plaintiff in that case.

That case is stayed pending the court's decision, which could take until the end of June.

In an interview with ""NBC Nightly News"" on Thursday, Cox said she was ""hopeful"" about the court's decision in her favor but that her family will be grieving over their unborn child's fatal diagnosis regardless.

""Even with being hopeful with the decision that came from the hearing (on Thursday), there’s still — we’re going through the loss of a child,"" Cox said. ""There’s no outcome here that I take home my healthy baby girl. So it’s hard.""

Kate Cox is a 31-year-old mother of two who was initially excited to discover she was pregnant with her third child. Several weeks into her pregnancy, Cox’s doctors informed her that the fetus had full trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition linked to abnormalities in many parts of the body. Not only does this create a high risk of either stillbirth or miscarriage, but continuing the pregnancy places Cox at high risk of a uterine rupture. This is a serious threat to her health and would imperil her ability to carry another child in the future.

Under Texas’ draconian abortion ban, even someone facing such extreme circumstances as Cox has few options. However, she went to court to seek relief, and as The Texas Tribune reports, Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble handed down a temporary restraining order that would allow Cox to obtain an abortion. However, Paxton wrote to three Houston-area hospitals within hours, threatening any facility or doctor who provides Cox with medical relief.

Under the current Texas abortion ban, abortions are permissible after six weeks of gestation only if the life of the mother is threatened. In Cox’s case, there is a possibility she could die as a result of continuing the pregnancy. However, the greater threat is to her long-term health.

Even if there are no further complications, the child will either be stillborn or suffer extensive abnormalities leading to rapid death. There is also a high likelihood of a miscarriage. Because Cox's previous two children were delivered via cesarean, a miscarriage at this point in her pregnancy creates a threat of uterine rupture, which would harm her future fertility.

In her ruling, Gamble wrote, “The Court finds that Ms. Cox’s life, health, and fertility are currently at serious risk. The longer Ms. Cox stays pregnant, the greater the risks to her life.”

In Paxton’s letter to three Houston-area hospitals, he calls Gamble an “activist” judge and claims she is unqualified to determine whether Cox faces a life-threatening situation. Paxton tells the hospitals that the temporary restraining order issued by Gamble “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws, including first degree felony prosecutions.”

Additional threats are aimed specifically at Dr. Damla Karsan, who has been identified as the doctor offering to perform the abortion procedure. “We remind you that the [temporary restraining order] will expire long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas’ abortion laws expires,” Paxton writes.

In September, despite clear evidence of his guilt, Paxton was acquitted in an impeachment trial before the Texas Senate. He still faces a federal investigation into the corruption charges at the heart of that impeachment.

According to the Texas Tribune, Cox burst into tears as Judge Gamble handed down her decision on Thursday. Cox issued a statement, saying, “It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when. I’m trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer.”

Paxton is doing everything in his power to make sure that suffering continues."
Dec 07 2023,"Texas judge approves abortion of nonviable fetus, drawing threat from Texas attorney general",The Week - News,left,https://theweek.com/law/texas-judge-approves-abortion-nonviable-pregnancy,"A Texas district judge on Thursday issued an emergency order authorizing a Dallas mother of two to obtain an abortion, ruling she qualified under a narrow exception to the state's near-total abortion ban. It is believed to be the first court-approved abortion since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022 and, The Texas Tribune reported, the first time in 50 years ""a judge has intervened to allow an adult woman to terminate her pregnancy.""

Kate Cox, 31, applied for emergency intervention on Tuesday after learning her 20-week fetus has trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition that almost always results in miscarriage, stillbirth or death soon after birth. Her doctors said continuing the nonviable pregnancy also threatened her own health and could force a hysterectomy, preventing future pregnancies.

“The court finds that Ms. Cox's life, health and fertility are currently at serious risk,"" Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said upon approving a 14-day temporary restraining order. ""The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be a parent and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice.""

Gamble's order shields Cox's health care providers from prosecution under Texas law, which threatens doctors who perform abortions with steep fines and up to 99 years in prison.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned a trio of Houston hospitals Thursday night that Gamble's order ""will not insulate you, or anyone else,"" from civil or criminal prosecution, and will expire ""long before the statute of limitations for violating Texas' abortion laws."" Paxton cannot directly appeal a temporary restraining order, the Tribune said, but he can file a writ of mandamus asking higher courts to ""take the extraordinary measure of overturning the emergency order.""

Paxton is ""overstating his case,"" South Texas College of Law professor Charles ""Rocky"" Rhodes told the Tribune, but there's too much ambiguity in the laws to rule out ""retroaction liability"" against the hospitals. Paxton's ""apparent zeal"" to enforce Texas abortion laws is also a risk factor, University of Houston law professor Seth Chandler told The Associated Press. ""If I were one of the doctors involved here, I would not sleep easy performing that abortion.""

The Texas Supreme Court is considering a separate lawsuit by five women seeking to clarify and expand the exceptions for endangered pregnant women under state law."
Dec 01 2023,"Fact-checking Newsom-DeSantis debate: Immigration, abortion, book bans and a poop map",PolitiFact,left,https://www.politifact.com/article/2023/dec/01/fact-checking-newsom-desantis-debate-migration-boo/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged each other’s records on immigration, crime, COVID-19 lockdowns, the economy and social issues in a rowdy Fox News matchup billed as ""The Great Red versus Blue State Debate.""

DeSantis is among the Republicans running behind former President Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination. Newsom, a Democrat, is not running for president — though he could be a future contender — and defended President Joe Biden’s record.

The governors in the debate, held in Alpharetta, Georgia, cherry-picked favorable data and talked over each other as moderator Sean Hannity flipped through topics. Newsom was telling ""a lot of whoppers,"" said DeSantis, whose props included a purported map of feces in San Francisco. (We fact-checked it at the end.)

""I can’t wait to get all the PolitiFacts tonight,"" Newsom said as they feuded over student learning.

Here are our fact-checks from their showdown.

Migration

DeSantis and Newsom went back and forth discussing their states’ population gains and losses.

""He’s the first governor to ever lose population,"" said DeSantis. ""They actually at one point ran out of U-Hauls in the state of California because so many people were leaving.""

California’s population declined for the first time ever in 2020, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. It’s been declining since then. (Newsom became governor in 2019). After the 2020 Census, California lost a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time in its history.

In January 2022, U-Haul said that it ran out of one-way trucks and trailers in California at the start of 2021. This was a result of the large demand of people moving out of California in 2020, leaving fewer trucks, a U-Haul spokesperson told The Sacramento Bee.

Newsom countered that there have been ""more Floridians coming to California than the other way around in the last two years.""

If measuring per capita, Newsom is right that more Floridians have moved to California than the other way around in the last two years, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. But the difference is so small that experts have questioned whether it is meaningful.

In 2022, 1.32 per 1,000 Floridians moved to California, and 1.31 per 1,000 Californians moved to Florida.

In raw numbers, more Californians moved to Florida than the other way around. But this does not account for California's higher population.

A 2023 poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 45% of Californians who considered moving to another state cited housing costs as a factor.

COVID-19 lockdowns

Newsom borrowed a page from former President Donald Trump’s playbook by misleadingly portraying DeSantis as a lockdown leader. Newsom’s comments focused on DeSantis’ actions in the pandemic’s first few weeks, when nearly all governors operated in lockstep. Newsom omits that DeSantis reopen earlier than most governors in the spring of 2020.

""You passed an emergency declaration before the state of California did,"" Newsom said. ""You closed down your beaches, your bars, your restaurants. It is a fact.""

Many local governments closed beaches for a limited time, but DeSantis did not close them statewide.

DeSantis issued an executive order on March 17, 2020, directing Floridians to ""limit their gatherings"" at beaches to no more than 10 people and to ""support beach closures at the discretion of local authorities.""

He also ordered beaches in Broward and Palm Beach counties to close for 11 days, following recommendations from local officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The governor's refusal to close most beaches to spring break crowds drew heavy criticism and litigation.

Newsom was on firmer ground in his claim about closing bars. DeSantis ordered all bars and nightclubs closed for 30 days. Restaurants did not close. His March 17 order said restaurants were limited to 50% customer capacity and had to separate seating by 6 feet.

Governors nationwide issued multiple orders in March 2020 in response to the pandemic. DeSantis issued an order March 1 to establish COVID-19 response protocol and direct a public health emergency. On March 4, Newsom declared a state of emergency to help California prepare for COVID-19.

Book bans in Florida

When Hannity asked DeSantis about the Florida bill criticized as ""don’t say gay,"" DeSantis held up a page from the graphic memoir ""Gender Queer,"" with black markings over private parts. Many Florida school districts have banned the book.

Newsom said Florida had been on a ""book-banning binge"" under DeSantis: ""One thousand four hundred and six books have been banned just last year under Ron DeSantis’ leadership."" DeSantis replied that it was a ""false narrative.""

This stems from one group’s count and does not represent 1,406 books banned statewide.

PEN America, a group that opposes book bans, recorded 1,406 book ban cases in Florida across about half of the state’s school districts. PEN America’s definition of a ban is more expansive than those of other groups. The organization records a book ban whenever access to a previously available book is removed or restricted — temporarily or permanently — because of parent or community challenges, administrative decisions or direct or threatened action by lawmakers or other governmental officials. Books that are removed temporarily may not return to shelves for months.

New Florida laws made it easier for parents to object to books, resulting in more school districts banning books in the past couple of years.

A September Florida Department of Education report shows 20 of Florida’s 67 school districts and the statewide public Florida Virtual School removed 298 books in the 2022-23 school year. Some of those books were banned in multiple districts. Overall, school district officials received 1,218 objections about books.

Many of the objections were for books containing sexual or LGBTQ+ content and came from a small group of parents, some affiliated with conservative groups, such as Moms for Liberty, a Tampa Bay Times analysis found.

Prompted by Hannity to say whether the bans were state or local, DeSantis said they were ""local."" That disguises state policy’s influence on local choices.

Newsom also said, ""What’s wrong with Amanda Gorman’s poetry?"" suggesting it was banned. A parent at a South Florida school challenged Gorman’s poem ""The Hill We Climb,"" which Gorman performed at Biden’s January 2021 inauguration. After a review, the K-through-eighth grade school moved the book to the library’s middle school section. It was not banned at the school, much less by the district or the state.

Tax policy

The governors sparred about taxes, with DeSantis asking how many people leave Florida for California because that state has a lower tax burden. ""They come to Florida because they pay lower taxes,"" DeSantis said.

But Newsom said Florida ""taxes low-income workers more than we tax millionaires and billionaires in the state of California.""

Newsom has a point, although the two states have such different tax systems that it’s tricky to compare them. For instance, Florida has no income tax, but California does.

Among the 50 states, Florida has the nation’s 11th-lowest overall tax burden, while California has the fifth-highest, according to annual rankings by the Tax Foundation, a think tank that advocates for lower taxes.

But the overall tax burden doesn’t address differences between workers’ share of taxes.

A study by the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy examined whether state tax systems rely on higher-income taxpayers (progressive) or lower-income taxpayers (regressive). Newsom’s office said this is the study he referred to. The data, though, is from 2018.

It found that in California, the top 1% of households for incomes paid 12.4% of their income in state and local taxes. By comparison, in Florida, households in the bottom 20% of incomes paid 12.7% of their income in state and local taxes. By this metric, Newsom is correct.

Comparing the tax burden for the lowest 20% of households in income, California also has lower taxes. In California, households in the bottom 20% paid 10.5% of their income in taxes, compared with Florida’s 12.7%.

Meanwhile, wealthy taxpayers came out ahead in Florida, where the tax burden for the top 1% was 2.3% of income. That’s far lower than the 12.4% rate for California millionaires.

Florida’s crime rate

As DeSantis described a conversation with Newsom’s father-in-law, who moved to Florida, he claimed Florida was experiencing a ""50-year low"" in the crime rate. Newsom said DeSantis’ ""own law enforcement"" said the data shouldn’t be used.

What used to be an easy talking point about Florida’s declining crime became controversial this year after the agency changed how it reported its crime rate.

NBC News reported Sept. 20 that DeSantis’ talking point came from a database with information from law enforcement agencies representing about 57% of Florida’s population. The story quoted three unnamed former Florida Department of Law Enforcement staff members who said they had warned top officials against using the ""50-year low"" claim, because it was impossible to verify.

Florida’s transitioned to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious crimes would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement told PolitiFact in September that the 50-year low statistic still holds after additional agencies submitted data, representing around 75% of the population.

The FBI’s crime reporting database shows that 49 of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. By contrast, in 2022, 367 Florida law enforcement agencies sent in data.

Florida’s abortion limits and DeSantis’ abortion survivor story

As Hannity pressed Newsom on whether he supported any abortion restrictions, Newsom attacked Florida’s abortion laws.

""He signed a bill banning any exceptions for rape and incest,"" Newsom said of DeSantis. ""And then he said it didn't go far enough and decided to sign a six-week ban … that criminalizes women and criminalizes doctors.""

DeSantis signed legislation in 2022 that outlawed abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It does not make exceptions for cases of incest, rape or human trafficking but includes an exception for the mother’s life.

DeSantis signed a stricter bill in April that bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Whether the law takes effect hinges on how the Florida Supreme Court rules in a lawsuit against the current 15-week ban. The 2023 law does contain exceptions, including to save the woman’s life or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Abortions for pregnancies involving rape, incest or human trafficking would be allowed until 15 weeks of pregnancy if a woman has documentation, such as a restraining order, police report or medical record.

The law penalizes physicians, but whether it also criminalizes women is less clear, so we have rated a similar claim Half True. The law says that anyone who ""actively participates in"" an abortion commits a third-degree felony, which opens the door to prosecutors charging women, but we don’t yet know whether they will or how courts would respond to such charges. DeSantis has also said that he doesn’t want women prosecuted, only doctors.

Defending the law, DeSantis repeated an anecdote from the first GOP presidential debate about a Floridian named Penny Hopper. Hopper is a real person, and an anti-abortion activist. Some of the details about her birth story have been called into question.

Hopper said she survived an abortion attempt in Florida in 1955. Her claim has been featured by anti-abortion groups and used to support ""born alive"" bills in state legislatures, which aim to protect infants who survive abortions, even though there are federal laws for that purpose.

In a video and in interviews, Hopper said she had been delivered around 23 weeks gestation after her mother went to a hospital in Wauchula, Florida, while experiencing bleeding. Hopper said the doctor induced labor, and she was born at 1 pound, 11 ounces, and that the doctor told staff to discard her ""dead or alive."" She said her grandmother found her the next day on the hospital porch in a bedpan. Then, Hopper said, a nurse volunteered to take her to a larger hospital that was about 40 miles away.

That a baby born at 23 weeks could survive overnight without medical attention in 1955 is medically dubious, experts said. From the 1950s through 1980, ""newborn death was virtually ensured"" for infants born at or before 24 weeks of gestation, The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology says on its website.

The Washington Post also reported that contemporaneous newspaper accounts offer a different scenario at the hospital, and said the staff spent days keeping her alive before arranging a police escort to rush her to another hospital.

Literacy rates and learning loss

DeSantis and Newsom each said their state handled education better during the pandemic.

DeSantis said that in the most recent results of a widely tracked standardized test, the National Assessment of Educational Progress, ""Florida came in No. 3 for fourth grade reading. California was far, far behind.""

This is accurate. Florida ranked third among states for fourth grade reading, after Massachusetts and Wyoming. California ranked 32nd.

On eighth grade reading, Florida ranked 21st, but still led California, which ranked 29th.

Newsom, meanwhile, said, ""Ron DeSantis had more learning loss during COVID"" in Florida than he had in California.

Measuring learning loss is complicated and varies by academic subject and age. But one study that tried to quantify how much students backslid overall during the pandemic supports Newsom’s statement.

In January 2023, McKinsey & Co., a consulting company, released a study of how National Assessment of Educational Progress results changed in each state from 2019 to 2022.

In the study, a 4-point drop in scores on the test was estimated to have produced 12 weeks of learning delay. Learning loss varied widely by state, with Hawaii and Alabama experiencing four weeks of loss and Delaware experiencing 32 weeks.

The study found that California students lost an average of nine weeks, compared with 12 weeks for Florida. That put California slightly below the 12-week national average and Florida slightly above it.

DeSantis criticized California for having ""one of the lowest literacy rates in the country."" He is correct — but he ignored that Florida’s literacy rate is nearly as low.

The federal Education Department uses a few metrics to measure literacy. The most comprehensive, calculated by modeling several measurements of literacy, has a fairly narrow range, from 252 (the lowest, for Louisiana) to 279 (the highest, for New Hampshire).

California has the sixth-lowest score of any state (257). But Florida has the ninth-lowest score at 259.

Violent crime statistics

Hannity said California’s levels of violent crime are ""way higher than the national average."" He showed a graphic with 2022 violent crime rates, based on FBI data. California had the highest rate, with 499.5 violent crimes per 100,000 people. The national average was 380.7 per 100,000, and Florida’s was 258.9 per 100,000. We checked the numbers in the graphic and found they were accurate.

Newsom pushed back on this narrative by focusing on one category of violent crime: murders. The other types of violent crime include forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

""Seven of the top 10 murder rates in the United States of America are red states,"" Newsom said.

Newsom is right, based on the voting patterns in the 2020 presidential election and 2020 state-by-state homicide rankings, according to an analysis of federal data by Third Way, a center-left policy group.

In descending order, the top 10 states for homicide rates were Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Missouri, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, Illinois, Maryland and Georgia. The first seven on that list all supported Trump in the 2020 election; the final three supported President Joe Biden. The analysis also found that ""solidly red states have dominated the top 10 murder rate states for the past decade"" or more.

Newsom also said that Florida ""has a 66% higher gun death rate than the state of California.""

This is close. According to 2020 federal data, Florida’s gun death rate was 14.1 per 100,000 residents, compared with 9.0 per 100,000 in California. That’s 57% higher for Florida.

However, both governors can point to other statistics to bolster their case as the safer locale.

California’s overall homicide rate of 5.7 per 100,000 people was higher than Florida’s rate of 5.0 per 100,000. Both states rank below the national rate of 6.3.

Florida’s gun homicide rate, 5.87 per 100,000, was higher than California’s, 4.65.

Americans in Israel

DeSantis did not tell the full story of how the Biden administration evacuated Americans from Israel after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

""Biden stranded a lot of American citizens over there who were trying to get home,"" DeSantis said. ""So, I did an executive order in Florida, and we sent planes over Israel right in the aftermath of Oct. 7, and we saved over 700 Americans, mostly Floridians, but not all, because Biden wouldn’t do it.""

About 700 Americans flew to Florida on four flights from Israel, DeSantis’ office said. The flights were free for passengers.

But the Biden administration also brought Americans home. It offered 6,900 seats to Americans in Israel seeking to depart by air, land or sea. As of Oct. 31, about 1,500 U.S. citizens and their family members had departed using federal government transport, a State Department spokesperson previously told PolitiFact.

The first flight landed in Athens, Greece. News reports said that the State Department flew Americans to European cities where they could book flights to the U.S. on commercial airlines. Florida officials offered to transport Americans who were in Athens to the U.S.

Per long-standing federal law and policy, the government seeks reimbursement from citizens for the cost of transportation.

Squabbling over Special Olympics

DeSantis and Newsom sparred over how the other treated the Special Olympics. Newsom said it was ""disgraceful"" that DeSantis threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million.

DeSantis fired back that Newsom ""wanted the athletes marginalized.""

What were they talking about?

In June 2022, ahead of a planned Special Olympics event in Orlando, the Florida Department of Health told the organization that its vaccine requirement conflicted with state law barring any business from asking for proof of COVID-19 vaccination. After Florida threatened to fine the Special Olympics $27 million, the organization eliminated its vaccine requirement.

Florida’s action prompted ""an emotional response"" for Newsom, he told the Sacramento Bee. He tweeted: ""Ron DeSantis’ values on full display: Bullying. The. Special. Olympics.""

In response, DeSantis emphasized how lifting the vaccine requirement enabled some participants to participate in the games even though health concerns prevented them from getting vaccinated. He cited participants such as Isabella Valle, who has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and a shunt in her brain.

Both governors have ties to the Special Olympics. Newsom headed the leadership committee for the Special Olympics’ World Games in Los Angeles in 2015, and his mother helped families adopt children with disabilities, the Bee reported.

DeSantis and his wife, Casey were honorary co-chairs of the 2022 Special Olympics.

Mapping human feces in San Francisco

During a conversation about homelessness, DeSantis pulled out a sheet of paper from his suit jacket and revealed a map of San Francisco filled with brown and black pinpoint icons.

During Red vs. Blue State #debate, @RonDeSantis showed @GavinNewsom our map of human feces all over San Francisco. It's just one of the many ways we track what you get for your tax $! Get the whole story here: https://t.co/XEKr29GXKE #transparencymatters https://t.co/jk47bNwDDE — OpenTheBooks (@open_the_books) December 1, 2023

""Well, this is an app where they plot the human feces that are found on the streets of San Francisco,"" said DeSantis. ""And you see how almost the whole thing is covered? Because that is what has happened in one of the previous greatest cities this country's ever had. Human feces is now a fact of life.""

DeSantis’ map comes from Open the Books, a nonprofit government watchdog. But what DeSantis pointed to isn’t current.

The map plotted public reports of human feces found in San Francisco from 2011 to 2019. (More than 118,000 people reported their findings to San Francisco’s nonemergency line.)

Newsom was San Francisco mayor from 2004 to 2011 and was California’s lieutenant governor from 2011 to 2019.

Open the Books does not seem to have a map of current data. But there is another map created by two Los Angeles teachers, showing reports from July 2019 to July 2020. That map has fewer data points than the visual DeSantis offered.

Dec 07 2023,Texas woman allowed to get abortion despite state’s ban after winning landmark suit,New York Post (News),right,https://nypost.com/2023/12/07/news/texas-judge-grants-pregnant-woman-permission-to-get-an-abortion-despite-states-ban,"AUSTIN, Texas — A Texas judge on Thursday gave a pregnant woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis permission to get an abortion in an unprecedented challenge over bans that more than a dozen states have enacted since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The lawsuit by Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area, is believed to be the first time since the landmark Supreme Court decision last year that a woman anywhere in the country has asked a court to approve an immediate abortion.

It was unclear how quickly or whether Cox would receive the procedure.

State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble, an elected Democrat, said she would grant a temporary restraining order that would allow Cox to have an abortion under what are narrow exceptions to Texas’ ban.

That decision is likely to be appealed by the state, which argued that Cox does not meet the criteria for a medical exception.

In a brief hearing Thursday, her attorneys told Gamble that Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, went to an emergency room this week for a fourth time during her pregnancy.

Cox and her husband both attended the hearing via Zoom but did not address the court.

Doctors have told Cox that if the baby’s heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior cesarean sections and that another C-section at full term would endanger her ability to carry another child.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Gamble said.

The Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox, has said this lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

Since that landmark ruling, Texas and 12 other states rushed to ban abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy.

Opponents have sought to weaken those bans, including an ongoing Texas challenge over whether the state’s law is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications.

“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy or continue to put my body or my mental health through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox wrote in an editorial published in The Dallas Morning News. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”

Although Texas allows exceptions under the ban, doctors and women have argued that the requirements are so vaguely worded that physicians still won’t risk providing abortions, lest they face potential criminal charges or lawsuits.

State officials had asked Gamble to deny the request, arguing that Cox has not shown her life is in imminent danger and that she is therefore unable to qualify for an exception to the ban.

“There are no facts pled which demonstrate that Ms. Cox is at any more of a risk, let alone life-threatening than the countless women who give birth every day with similar medical histories,” the state wrote in court filings ahead of Thursday’s hearing.

Spokespersons for Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton did not immediately return messages addressing whether the state will appeal. Cox’s attorneys have argued that the risks to her health will worsen unless the courts act swiftly.

The decision was handed down just two days after Cox filed the lawsuit, which says doctors told her the baby would likely be stillborn or live for a week at most.

Cox had cesarean sections with her previous pregnancies. She learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit was filed a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the ban is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications.

That case is among the biggest ongoing challenges to abortion bans in the U.S., although a ruling from the all-Republican court may not come for months.

In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions despite their spiraling conditions.

A judge later ruled that Texas’ ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that decision was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.

More than 40 women have received abortions in Texas since the ban took effect, according to state health figures, none of which have resulted in criminal charges.

There were more than 16,000 abortions in Texas in the five months before the ban taking effect last year."
Nov 30 2023,"Gavin Newsom and Ron DeSantis debate abortion, taxes, crime and who's the bigger bully",NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/gavin-newsom-ron-desantis-debate-taxes-crime-rcna126734,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and California Gov. Gavin Newsom duked it out in a roughly two-hour debate Thursday that was heavy on contrasts between their leadership of two of the nation’s largest states but lighter on references to the ongoing presidential primaries — the race one of the men is currently running in.

“There are profound differences tonight,” Newsom said in his opening statement to Fox News host Sean Hannity, who moderated the contest. “And I look forward to engaging [on them]. But there’s one thing in closing that we have in common ... neither of us will be the nominee for our party in 2024.”

It was an assertion that DeSantis, who interjected and pushed back against Newsom throughout the night, didn't counter.

The showdown — dubbed ""The Great Red vs. Blue State Debate"" by Fox News — featured spirited exchanges on tax, education, abortion, energy, immigration, Covid and crime policy, with both DeSantis and Newsom warning that their opponent's models would be disastrous for the country if they were exported nationwide.

""Gavin Newsom was mayor of San Francisco,"" DeSantis said. ""So he took the San Francisco model, turned that into a template for California’s collapse. Now the left wants to take the California model and use that as a template for America’s collapse.""

The two men agreed to debate each other in August, setting up a contest between DeSantis — a current presidential candidate and possibly a future one if he fails to nab the Republican presidential nomination this cycle — and Newsom, a governor who is considered a likely future presidential contender and is serving now as a top surrogate for President Joe Biden.

The debate came with roughly six weeks to go until January's Iowa caucuses, a must-win contest for DeSantis, who trails former President Donald Trump by large margins in both state and national surveys.

Newsom made note of DeSantis' polling deficit at multiple points and repeated attacks that both Trump and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, a fellow contender in the GOP primary, have made against him.

During an exchange on immigration policy, Newsom said DeSantis' strategy was merely ""trolling folks"" and ""trying to find migrants to play political games, trying to get some news and attention so you can out-Trump Trump.""

""And by the way, how’s that going for you, Ron?"" Newsom said. ""You’re down 41 points in your own home state.""

For much of the past two years, DeSantis and Newsom have pointed to each other's governance as a foil for their leadership at home, with both taking each other on on his home turf.

At the forefront for both men were strong differences over Covid and education policy, which were at the center of Thursday's debate.

DeSantis talked up keeping businesses like Walt Disney World open early in the pandemic while blasting Newsom for school and business closings.

""You were not following science,"" DeSantis said. ""You were a lockdown governor. You did a lot of damage to your people.""

Newsom countered that DeSantis had initially closed down businesses at the onset of the outbreak and followed guidance from Dr. Anthony Fauci, then the nation's top infectious diseases expert, whom DeSantis has railed against over the past few years.

""You followed science; you followed Fauci,"" Newsom said, adding that DeSantis had also previously worn a mask and promoted Covid vaccines. ""He decided to fall prey to the fringe of his party, and as a consequence of that, Ron, tens of thousands of people lost their lives.""

DeSantis hit back by talking about California's lengthy public school closings and adding that Newsom acts at the behest of teachers unions, major supporters of the Democratic Party.

""That’s why the kids were locked out of school for so long,"" he said. ""Joe Biden is in the pocket of the teachers union, and so is Kamala Harris.""

Newsom jumped in to correct DeSantis' mispronunciation of Harris' first name. It wasn't the only time the two men sought to correct each other or spoke over each other. Both accused the other of frequently lying about the other's record, with DeSantis calling his California counterpart ""a slick, slippery politician."" At one point, the two men took turns lamenting each other for browbeating others.

“You’re nothing but a bully,"" Newsom said.

“You’re a bully,"" DeSantis responded.

DeSantis, at two points, used props to help back up his assertions. In one instance, he held up a map purporting to show documented instances of human feces that were reported on the streets of San Francisco. At another moment, he held up imagery of cartoon depictions of sex acts from the book ""Gender Queer,"" which was removed from Florida school districts.

Newsom took issue with DeSantis' framing of restrictions on books in public schools and said his education platform was a ""sword"" he used to launch broader attacks on LGBTQ Americans.

""I don’t like the way you demean people,"" Newsom said. ""I don’t like the way you demean the LGBTQ community. I don’t like the way you demean and humiliate people you disagree with, Ron. I really find this fundamentally offensive, and this is a core value that distinguishes the values of my state and, frankly, the vast majority of Americans against the weaponization of education.”

The two battled over the economy, as well, with DeSantis pointing to high prices and the cost of living in California, as well as Newsom's embrace of Biden's economic agenda.

""I'll give Gavin credit, he did at least admit in his first answer he's joined at the hip with Biden and Harris,"" DeSantis said. ""He thinks Biden and Harris have done a great job. He thinks the economy is working because of their policies for Americans, and they are not. And so what California represents is the Biden-Harris agenda on steroids.""

Newsom countered that DeSantis promoted $28 million in investments in semiconductor and chip manufacturing made possible by legislation Biden signed. And, taking issue with how Hannity framed some questions, he said Fox News viewers weren't being presented with positive economic news, including wage growth, cooling inflation and substantial growth in the gross domestic product in the previous quarter.

While the presidential campaign played a secondary role in the debate, both candidates were pressed about whether they felt Biden was up for four more years.

""Yes, he’s in decline,"" DeSantis said. ""Yes, it’s a danger to the country. He has no business running for president. And you know, Gavin Newsom agrees with that. He won’t say that. That’s why he’s running his shadow campaign. [Biden] should not be running. He is not up to the job. and it is dangerous for this country.""

Newsom disagreed that he's running a shadow campaign for president, saying DeSantis was ""making this stuff up."" He said he ""will take Joe Biden at 100 vs. Ron DeSantis any day of the week at any age.""

Biden ""will be our nominee in a matter of weeks,"" Newsom said. ""And in a matter of weeks, Sean, [DeSantis will] be endorsing Donald Trump as the nominee for the Republican Party.""

In closing, Hannity praised both men for taking part in the debate and asked whether they would agree to battle again at some point in the near future.

""Joe Biden should show up to a debate,"" DeSantis said. ""Donald Trump should show up to a debate."""

Dec 07 2023,Texas judge allows abortion for woman whose fetus has fatal disorder trisomy 18,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-ban-kate-cox-emergency-fetus-trisomy-18-judge-maya-guerra-gamble,"Austin, Texas — A judge in Texas on Thursday granted permission for a woman to terminate her pregnancy despite the state's strict abortion ban due to her fetus being diagnosed with what doctors describe as a fatal disorder.

Kate Cox, a 31-year-old Dallas-area mother of two, said she found out last week that her baby suffered from the chromosomal disorder trisomy 18, which usually results in either stillbirth or an early death of an infant. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed an emergency lawsuit Monday on behalf of Cox and her husband.

""The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" Gamble said in the Zoom hearing. ""So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.""

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office issued a statement saying the temporary restraining order ""will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas' abortion laws."" Paxton's office also included a letter sent to several medical centers outlining action it will take against doctors who perform an abortion.

The Center for Reproductive Rights said the state does not have the right to an immediate appeal.

Gamble's decision is believed to be the first time a judge has allowed a woman to legally get an abortion since the decision of Roe v. Wade in 1973, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. The ruling only applies to Cox.

According to the lawsuit, Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, has been to three different emergency rooms in the past month, and her doctors have told her that early screening and ultrasound tests suggested her pregnancy is ""unlikely to end with a healthy baby,"" and due to her two prior cesarean sections, continuing the pregnancy puts her at risk of ""severe complications"" that threaten ""her life and future fertility.""

The lawsuit alleges that due to Texas' strict abortion bans, doctors have told her their ""hands are tied"" and she would have to wait until the fetus dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, when she will have to undergo a third C-section ""only to watch her baby suffer until death.""

On Nov. 28, Cox received the results of an amniocentesis, which confirmed that her fetus suffered from a genetic condition called trisomy 18 — a diagnosis, the lawsuit says, that means her pregnancy may not last until birth and if it does, her baby will be stillborn or survive only for minutes, hours or days.

Cox had already been told by a specialist that her fetus suffered from a ""spinal abnormality"" and over the next five weeks, every ultrasound showed more ""multiple serious conditions,"" the lawsuit says.

The lawsuit was filed as the State Supreme Court is weighing whether the state's strict abortion ban is too restrictive for women who suffer from severe pregnancy complications. An Austin judge ruled earlier this year that women who experience extreme complications could be exempt from the ban, but the ruling is on hold while the all-Republican Supreme Court considers the state's appeal.

In the arguments before the state Supreme Court, the state's lawyers suggested that a woman who is pregnant and receives a fatal fetal diagnosis could bring a ""lawsuit in that specific circumstance.""

Texas' abortion ban

Texas has some of the strictest abortion laws in the country. In 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law SB8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. A ""trigger ban"" also went into effect following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that made it a felony for doctors in the state to perform an abortion unless the life of the patient is in danger.

Earlier this year, several women who were denied abortions despite severe pregnancy complications filed a lawsuit asking the state to clarify the strict abortion ban for medical exemptions. In July, an Austin court heard testimony from four of the women in the lawsuit as well as a Houston OB-GYN representing her patients.

Lead plaintiff Amanda Zurawski, who attended President Biden's State of the Union address this year as a guest of first lady Jill Biden, testified that she was denied an emergency abortion when her water broke when she was just 18 weeks pregnant. She said she suffered from a number of medical complications and knew she would miscarry, but doctors initially told her they could not induce labor because the fetus still had a heartbeat.

After developing sepsis three days later, doctors finally performed an induction abortion. As a result of two bouts of sepsis, she said one of her fallopian tubes has closed permanently, and she has had to undergo several procedures to reconstruct her uterus. She said her doctor told her that the only way she could get pregnant again was through IVF. Since then, Zurawski has undergone three egg retrievals, but she and her husband still have concerns about a future pregnancy.

Another woman, Samantha Casiano, who has four children, was forced to carry her pregnancy to term despite a 100% fatal condition. Casiano became so emotional on the stand while describing carrying a doomed pregnancy to term that she threw up.

Casiano testified that she looked into leaving the state for an abortion, as others had, but she worried about the cost and she feared she and her husband would ""get in trouble.""

""I have children, I can't go to jail,"" she recalled thinking. ""I can't get this fine, how would I pay for that, I can't lose my job. I felt like I had no options.""

Travis County Judge Jessica Mangrum ruled in August that women who experience pregnancy complications are exempt from the state's abortion bans. But the state immediately appealed, putting Mangrum's decision on hold until the state Supreme Court rules.

What is trisomy 18?

According to Cox, her amniocentesis revealed her fetus suffered from trisomy 18, meaning it had three copies of chromosome 18 instead of two. According to the Cleveland Clinic, heart problems are present in 90% of babies born with trisomy 18, as well as kidney disease, breathing abnormalities, gastrointestinal tract and abdominal wall issues, birth defects and spinal problems.

Former Sen. Rick Santorum's 15-year-old daughter was born with trisomy 18."

(Alex Wong/Getty Images)

Idaho’s attorney general’s office filed an emergency petition with the U.S. Supreme Court to permit the enforcement of a statewide abortion law, coming after a lower court ruled the state can partially enforce the ban.

The petition, filed on Nov. 20, comes in response to a Biden administration lawsuit filed last year, and it asks the top court to stay an injunction that prevents the state from issuing penalties to doctors who perform abortions under certain emergency situations.

At issue is the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) which requires hospitals to offer abortions to stabilize a pregnant woman in an emergency situation. The federal government sued Idaho in a federal court and argued that EMTALA prohibits Idaho from enforcing the regulation, which was initially blocked by an Idaho judge, who sided with the Biden administration.

A three-judge panel with the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Idaho judge’s decision in late September, allowing Idaho to enforce its law. The Ninth Circuit in October then temporarily blocked enforcement of the law and granted a Department of Justice request to rehear the case.

Now, Idaho’s motion to the Supreme Court asks the justices to immediately halt the Ninth Circuit’s October ruling.

“The United States’ position conflicts with the universal agreement of federal courts of appeal that EMTALA does not dictate a federal standard of care or displace state medical standards,” Monday’s petition reads. “The district court accepted the United States’ revisionist, post-Dobbs reading of EMTALA and enjoined Idaho’s Defense of Life Act in emergency rooms,” it continued, referring to the Supreme Court’s 2022 landmark ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.

Meanwhile, it added, “The district court’s injunction effectively turns EMTALA’s protection for the uninsured into a federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent, human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply.”

What’s more, according to the Idaho attorney general’s office, EMTALA “is silent” regarding the issue of abortion and instead, “actually requires stabilizing treatment for the unborn children of pregnant women.”

Idaho’s attorney general’s office wrote that “EMTALA does not require any particular form of medical treatment—abortion or otherwise—an Idaho hospital complies with EMTALA by providing a pregnant woman with an emergency medical condition the same care it would give to any similarly situated patient, regardless of ability to pay.”

“That may include medical treatments other than abortion to resolve a pregnant woman’s emergency medical condition,” the petition stated. “In sum, the United States has no legitimate interest in compelling Idaho’s compliance with an implied federal mandate contrary to EMTALA’s text and context.”

Idaho in 2020 passed a so-called “trigger” law that would ban abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that allowed abortions nationwide. Justice Samuel Alito, in overturning the law, essentially turned the issue of abortion back to the states to choose whether they want to enforce it or not, although the ruling has often been mischaracterized by legacy media outlets.

Under Idaho’s law, it allows a doctor who performs an abortion to raise the defense that the procedure is needed to save the life of the mother or if the pregnancy resulted from a reported rape or incest. However, the physician has to carry out the procedure that is likely to save both the life of the child and the mother.

But the Biden administration wrote in its lawsuit last year that could potentially require abortions that would not be included under Idaho’s narrow exception for saving the mother’s life. Idaho-based U.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix agreed and blocked the law from being enforced in cases of abortions needed to avoid putting the patient’s health in “serious jeopardy” or risking “serious impairment to bodily functions.”

But 9th Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke wrote for the panel in September that there was no conflict because EMTALA “does not set standards of care or specifically mandate that certain procedures, such as abortion, be offered.”

The appeals court judge also said that any conflict had been eliminated since Judge Hendrix’s decision because the state legislature had passed an amendment clarifying the law, and the state’s Supreme Court had clarified that the exception applies when a doctor believes, in good faith, that an abortion is necessary to save the mother’s life.

As the lawsuit was filed by the DOJ last year, Attorney General Merrick Garland released a statement arguing that women in Idaho “can obtain the emergency medical treatment to which they are entitled under federal law,” which includes an “abortion when that is the necessary treatment.”

The attorney general also vowed that the DOJ will “continue to use every tool at its disposal” to go after laws that block abortions.

Oct 31 2023,Kansas judge issues statewide pause on medical abortions law,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/kansas-judge-issues-statewide-pause-medical-abortions-law,"A Kansas judge on Monday put a new state law on medication abortions on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies.

The ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in Kansas, where a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram's order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years. The waiting period had been in place since 1997.

""The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue,"" Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. ""Nevertheless, the State’s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights.""

ABORTION ON DEMAND: THESE 6 STATES ALLOW WOMEN TO GET PREGNANCY-ENDING DRUGS BY PHONE OR ONLINE

ABORTION CHATBOT CHARLEY HELPS WOMEN END THEIR PREGNANCIES: 'LET'S GET STARTED'

Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions.

""Each day these restrictions were in effect, we have been forced to turn away patients for reasons that are medically wrong and ethically unjustifiable,"" said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, which operates three Kansas clinics providing abortion services.

The legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion. In August, a judge in Texas ruled that the state's ban was too restrictive, and the Utah Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions.

""These kinds of informed consent laws reflect the long-standing will of the people of Kansas,"" Caleb Dalton, senior counsel for the conservative group Alliance Defending Freedom, which is helping the state defend its anti-abortion laws, said in a statement. ""Kansans are right to want to protect maternal health and safety and the lives of the unborn, and we will continue defending their interests.""

Kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with Republican-controlled legislatures. The state Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a ""fundamental"" right. GOP lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn't grant a right to abortion — and in the August 2022 vote, that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin, upholding abortion rights.

'ABORTION IS OK' HIGHWAY BILLBOARDS ANGER SURVIVORS: 'ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING'

Jayaram concluded that the restrictions now on hold violate a patient's right to bodily autonomy. The judge also ruled that they violate doctors' free speech rights by giving doctors ""no discretion"" to omit any of the material mandated by the state.

""In addition, there is no credible evidence that the mandatory delays imposed by the Act for arbitrary periods of time are likely to, in fact, improve either the consent/decision-making process by pregnant patients or conduct by the medical profession,"" the judge wrote.

Republican lawmakers argued this year that ""reasonable restrictions"" are still fair game. A law that took effect July 1 required abortion providers to tell their patients that a medication abortion can be stopped using a regimen touted by anti-abortion groups. The state agreed not to enforce it until another ruling from Jayaram.

In an August hearing, Jayaram said his reading of medical literature showed that the regimen's effectiveness is not confirmed by any valid studies. Major medical groups consider the regimen ineffective and potentially unsafe.

Providers also attacked existing laws enacted by GOP lawmakers as a way to ensure patients are properly informed before undergoing an abortion. Patients not only must receive medical information 24 hours before the procedure, but that information must also be in writing and in a specific size and style of type. It must include statements drafted by abortion opponents about fetal development and purported abortion risks that major medical groups consider debunked, false or misleading.

In his ruling, Jayaram said that abortion providers had provided ""credible evidence"" that much of the information that doctors are required to provide is medically inaccurate and ""inconsistent with generally accepted science"" for embryonic and fetal development.

FEDERAL APPEALS COURT RESTRICTS ACCESS TO ABORTION PILL MIFEPRISTONE, DRUG REMAINS AVAILABLE

Attorneys for the providers have argued that the growing layers of restrictions created a biased counseling scheme designed to discourage abortion. Kansas doesn't ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy.

The providers also said challenging older restrictions became more compelling as other states banned abortion and out-of-state residents flooded them with requests for appointments. Kansas saw a 57% increase in abortions in 2022, according to state health department data.

Alice Wang, staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, an abortion rights group representing providers, said in a statement that Jayaram's order removed ""paternalistic barriers"" to abortion access.

""These restrictions are especially harmful now that Roe v. Wade was overturned, and Kansas clinics are overwhelmed with patients from neighboring states where abortion is banned,"" she added.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ASKS SUPREME COURT TO TAKE UP MAJOR ABORTION PILL CASE

Abortion opponents argued repeatedly before the August 2022 vote that without a change in the state constitution, all existing abortion restrictions could be at risk. The state Supreme Court is reviewing a 2015 law banning the most common second-trimester procedure and a 2011 law imposing tougher health and safety requirements only for abortion providers. Neither has been enforced because of the litigation.

Attorneys for the state and the Alliance for Defending Freedom argue that in suing the state this year, providers are working against their patients' interest in having as much information as possible. Danielle Underwood, spokesperson for Kansans for Life, the state's most politically influential anti-abortion group, said Jayaram's decision left women seeking abortions more vulnerable.

""This is a nightmare for women and a dream come true for the profit-driven abortion industry,"" she said in a statement."

Dec 12 2023,"Abortion Groups 'Siphoned' Billions from Taxpayers over Three Years, Report Shows - The Michigan Star",The Michigan Star,right,https://themichiganstar.com/news/abortion-groups-siphoned-billions-from-taxpayers-over-three-years-report-shows/mistarstaff/2023/12/13,"by Jake Smith

Abortion advocacy groups received close to $2 billion in federal taxpayer funding from 2019 to 2021, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released on Tuesday.

The GAO report was first requested in early 2022 by 142 congressional members led by Republican Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn and New Jersey Rep. Chris Smith, who underscored their concerns that taxpayer dollars are being used to fund abortion services. The report revealed that Planned Parenthood received approximately $1.78 billion in taxpayer funding from 2019 to 2021 and is receiving increased federal support under the current Biden administration.

“It is appalling that big abortion providers are continuing to receive billions of dollars in federal taxpayer funding,” Blackburn told the Daily Caller News Foundation in a statement. “The American people want their tax dollars spent responsibly and in line with our nation’s values — not on the Left’s abortion-on-demand agenda. I will never stop fighting to protect the unborn and end taxpayer-funded support for the abortion industry.”

“Federal taxpayer dollars should not be funneled to big abortion corporations like Planned Parenthood, which has killed over 9.3 million unborn children since 1970, including 1.11 million between 2019-2021,” Smith told the DCNF in a statement. “This money would have been better spent helping the businesses that were forced to close or providing comprehensive medical support for both women and children.”

.@PPFA thinks any reason is the right reason for an abortion up until birth. These are the radicals, not pro-life advocates. https://t.co/NvODSkTEcI — Sen. Marsha Blackburn (@MarshaBlackburn) June 1, 2023

Planned Parenthood was granted approximately $90 million in forgiven loans during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the GAO report. These loans were meant to be provided to small businesses with 500 employees or less, but Planned Parenthood has over 16,000 employees through affiliates worldwide and still took the funding.

“Planned Parenthood illegally siphoned over $90 million from the Paycheck Protection Program, specifically designed to help our mom-and-pop shops keep their doors open,” Blackburn told the DCNF.

The Biden administration increased funding obligations to Planned Parenthood from approximately $5.7 million to $27 million between 2021 to 2022, a total 373% increase, according to the GAO report. The Biden administration also revoked a Trump administration rule in January 2021 that prevented funding from being used by foreign organizations to provide abortion services.

Aside from Planned Parenthood, five other abortion providers, including MSI Reproductive Choices, received over $100 million in taxpayer funding, according to the GAO report.

Approximately 60% percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer funding to pay for abortion services, according to a 2023 Marist poll, while 78% of Americans oppose taxpayer funding being used for abortion services in other countries.

The Marist poll was conducted from Jan. 6 to Jan. 9 with 1,025 respondents from both political parties. The margin of error was within ±3.5 percentage points.

The plaintiff’s attorneys signaled their intent to continue the challenge to Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban, but did not immediately comment on what effect the development would have on the lawsuit.

The complaint was filed last week in a state court in Louisville. The plaintiff, identified only as Jane Doe, was seeking class-action status to include other Kentuckians who are or will become pregnant and want to have an abortion. The suit filed last week said she was about eight weeks pregnant.

The flurry of individual women petitioning a court for permission for an abortion is the latest development since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year. The Kentucky case is similar to a legal battle taking place in Texas, where Kate Cox, a pregnant woman with a likely fatal condition, launched an unprecedented challenge against one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.

But unlike the Texas case, little is known about the Kentucky plaintiff. Her attorneys have insisted they would fiercely protect their client’s privacy, stressing that Jane Doe believes “everyone should have the right to make decisions privately and make decisions for their own families,” Amber Duke, executive director for the ACLU of Kentucky, said last week. Her legal team also declined to disclose whether Jane Doe still needed an abortion.

Instead, Jane Doe’s attorneys urged other women who are pregnant and seeking an abortion in the Bluegrass State to reach out if they are interested in joining the case. The lawsuit says Kentucky’s near-total abortion ban violates the plaintiff’s rights to privacy and self-determination under the state constitution.

“Jane Doe sought an abortion in Kentucky, and when she could not get one, she bravely came forward to challenge the state’s abortion ban,” ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project deputy director Brigitte Amiri said in a statement. “Although she decided to have an abortion, the government denied her the freedom to control her body. Countless Kentuckians face the same harm every day as the result of the abortion ban.”

According to court documents, Jane Doe had a medical appointment Dec. 8 — after the lawsuit was filed — where no cardiac activity was discovered after an ultrasound was performed.

In the Texas case, Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, had been seeking court permission to end her pregnancy in a state where abortion is only allowed in narrow exceptions when the life of the mother is in danger — not for fetal anomalies. Before the Texas Supreme Court on Monday rejected Cox's request, her attorneys said she had left the state to get an abortion elsewhere because she could not wait any longer due to concerns that remaining pregnant would jeopardize her health and her ability to have more children.

While Cox is believed to be the first to make such a request, her legal team and other experts anticipate other challenges among the dozen of other GOP-controlled states where abortion is largely prohibited at all stages of pregnancy. Meanwhile, a handful of separate legal challenges are taking place across the country highlighting the stories from women who were denied abortions while facing harrowing pregnancy complications.

Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Supreme Court refused to halt the state’s near-total abortion ban and another outlawing abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy. The justices focused on narrow legal issues but did not resolve larger constitutional questions about whether access to abortion should be legal in the state.

The legal challenge revolves around Kentucky’s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban — both passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law was passed in 2019 and took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. It bans abortions except when they are carried out to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.

Kentucky voters last year rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature in chipping away at the state’s anti-abortion laws.

As a result of the ruling, patient-led challenges “are our only path forward to strike down the bans under the right to privacy and right to self-determination,” Amiri said.

""We will do everything we can to restore abortion access in Kentucky,” she said."
Dec 05 2023,Dane Co. judge reaffirms ruling on 1849 Wisconsin law conservatives interpreted as abortion ban,ABC 27 WKOW,center,https://wkow.com/news/dane-co-judge-reaffirms-ruling-on-1849-wisconsin-law-conservatives-interpreted-as-abortion-ban/article_3ec60c5a-93ed-11ee-8f0e-670f6e5222ed.html,"MADISON (WKOW) -- A Dane County judge has reaffirmed her July ruling that Wisconsin state law allows abortions.

In Wisconsin's most recent election cycle, abortion access was a major issue to voters. Specifically, an 1849 law conservative lawmakers interpreted as an abortion ban. But a Dane County judge ruled it's a ban on feticide.

""So, imagine a car accident or someone who shoots a pregnant woman in the stomach or another event, a violent event that causes the destruction of the fetus,"" UW-Madison politics professor Howard Schweber said. ""That's what that law was focused on.""

Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper reaffirmed that ruling Tuesday.

""Today's ruling really doesn't change anything substantive,"" Schweber said. ""It does add an emphasis to the earlier ruling that no, the 1849 statute really isn't about abortion and doesn't ban abortion.""

Wisconsin also has a law from 1985 that was adopted after Roe v. Wade protecting abortion access. Schweber says there's a longstanding principal that newer laws override older ones. So, this ruling doesn't change abortion access in the state as it currently stands.

""That remains the law in Wisconsin. So, it's not as though we're suddenly in a situation of extreme chaos,"" Schweber said. ""I think this is the real point. That [this ruling] can be a vehicle to go to the state Supreme Court and gain some clarity on the question of what restrictions on abortion does the Wisconsin State Constitution permit.""

Schweber says he's confident the case will reach the state Supreme Court. In that case, the state as a whole will finally have a definitive answer on access to abortion rather than different district judges coming to different conclusions.

To Schweber, this ruling is more likely to have political impact.

""This will be hugely important, I think, going forward in judicial elections,"" Schweber said. ""Judicial elections in Wisconsin have been highly partisan and policy- and politics-driven for years now. This will become a driving force. If you are a pro-life voter, you will be moved to say we need to elect conservative state court justices.""

As this ruling has no effect on the 1985 law, Schweber says that will continue to be the precedent in Wisconsin."
Nov 28 2023,Future of abortion ban exemptions lies with Texas Supreme Court after oral arguments,The Dallas Morning News,center,https://dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2023/11/28/texas-abortion-ban-supreme-court,"Dr. Austin Dennard and her patient, Lauren Miller, stood side-by-side in front of the Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday, with Dennard’s infant son in a stroller behind them.

For less than an hour that morning, Texas’ top court heard oral arguments over a temporary injunction that would exempt any Texan with a medically complicated pregnancy from the state’s abortion bans, which currently allow for an exemption only when the mother’s life is at risk. But that definition is unclear, critics have argued, and doctors and hospitals have been reluctant to allow the procedure even in hopeless or dire circumstances for fear of violating the law.

State Supreme Court justices peppered representatives for the state and the plaintiffs with questions about whether the women had standing to bring the case and whether the state is the right target for lawsuits regarding how the abortion bans are implemented.

Following the hearing, Dennard and Miller, both plaintiffs in the suit, spoke about the abortions that they each had to travel out-of-state for after learning their fetuses had fatal conditions and would not survive long after birth. Dennard joined the case as a plaintiff after learning her patient went through the same experience.

“There was a question about, ‘Why didn’t patients sue their doctors?’ Here’s my doctor. I don’t know what more they want. She is standing here alongside me,” Miller said. “That is a good doctor. That is not the person I should be suing here.”

Twenty women have joined the high-profile lawsuit — Zurawski vs. State of Texas — since it was filed by the Center for Reproductive Rights in March.

The case saw a brief victory in August when Travis County Judge Jessica Mangrum granted their request for the temporary injunction, which would exclude any Texan with a medically complicated pregnancy, including those with fatal fetal diagnoses, from the bans while the case moves through the court system.

Attorney General Ken Paxton’s office immediately appealed the decision directly to the Supreme Court, placing a stay on the injunction.

No plaintiffs testified in front of the Supreme Court as they did during an emotionally charged, two-day hearing in Austin this summer. Tuesday’s proceedings were instead an opportunity for the justices to clarify any questions they had about the arguments presented by each side.

Sometimes, the types of questions the justices ask can hint at how they will lean their decision, said Seema Mohapatra, health law expert and professor at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law.

“But this is not the final adjudication of the case,” Mohapatra said.

The state argues that the plaintiffs in the case — 20 women who had abortions and two doctors who say the abortion ban leaves them at risk of prison, large fines or losing their licenses — don’t have the ability to seek clarity on the bans because any decision would help them only in hypothetical scenarios, like if they were to get pregnant again in the future.

“Assume one of these statues is unclear,” said Justice Jeff Boyd. “Who would be able to file suit seeking clarity? Under what circumstances would they have standing … and who would be the proper defendant?”

Beth Klusmann, prosecutor for the state, said the plaintiffs’ issues lie with their doctors, not with the law. She also said the question of whether the bans are unclear is a problem for the legislature, not the courts.

Another justice asked Klusmann whether the bans put medical professionals in bad situations.

“No, your honor,” Klusmann said. “I don’t think it does if they are allowed to use reasonable medical judgment, which is presumably a judgment they use when treating a patient in any given circumstance.”

The justices pressed Molly Duane, attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, on why this case should be taken up against the state rather than a doctor or another entity, such as the Texas Medical Board.

“The state has pointed to a number of other entities that they think can provide clarity here, but only the state, or a court of the state, can provide an interpretation of the statute that is actually enforceable,” Duane said.

A justice questioned how a doctor having to make difficult decisions with serious potential consequences is any different from other front-line jobs, like that of a police officer. Duane said the two situations aren’t analogous and that doctors don’t feel protected in their ability to make medical decisions, which is directly affecting patient experiences.

“We’re not talking about hypothetical harms. These are real patients, many of whom are sitting in the courtroom today,” Duane said.

Unless the court dismisses the case, the lawsuit will return to a lower court for litigation.

“We will be able to go back down to the district court to seek a permanent injunction and have a full trial where every single person standing behind me can testify,” Duane said."
Dec 11 2023,Texas Supreme Court rules against first woman to seek court-approved abortion in 50 years,Austin American-Statesman,center,https://statesman.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/12/11/texas-supreme-court-rules-against-woman-seeking-court-approved-abortion/71886066007,"The Texas Supreme Court in a highly anticipated decision on Monday evening ruled that Kate Cox, a Dallas area mother carrying a fetus with a fatal condition, does not qualify for an abortion under state laws based on her doctor's ""good faith belief"" that she needs the procedure.

""The statute requires that judgment be a 'reasonable medical' judgment, and Dr. (Damla) Karsan has not asserted that her 'good faith belief' about Ms. Cox’s condition meets that standard,"" the opinion reads.

In a near-total abortion ban, Texas prohibits abortions beginning at fertilization, with exceptions only for cases in which a pregnant patient risks death or “substantial impairment of major bodily function.""

The opinion is the last twist in a six-day legal saga and comes just hours after Cox's attorneys said she had left the state to terminate her pregnancy.

More:Kate Cox 'forced to leave Texas' to obtain abortion after challenging state's ban

Cox is the first woman to have asked a court to authorize an abortion since before Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that established a right to an abortion, was decided in 1973.

Granting Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's appeal, the seven-page Supreme Court opinion tosses a lower court's order that blocked Paxton, the state and the Texas Medical Board from enforcing the state's abortion bans in Cox's case.

The decision hinges primarily on the requirement set out in House Bill 1280 — the state's ""trigger law"" outlawing abortions that went into effect Aug. 25, 2022, 30 days after the Roe decision was overturned — that doctors exercise ""reasonable medical judgment"" in determining whether a woman qualifies for a legal exception to an abortion ban.

The ruling has broad ramifications for future interpretation of abortion laws in state, including in the other abortion-related case pending before the high court, Zurawski v. Texas. Justices indicated they were not inclined to broaden the exception, stating doctors must adhere to a standard of ""reasonable medical judgment"" rather than a ""good faith belief"" that a patient needs a life-saving abortion.

""These laws reflect the policy choice that the Legislature has made, and the courts must respect that choice,"" the opinion reads.

How the case unfolded

Cox's attorneys on Dec. 5 requested an emergency hearing in a Travis County District Court to seek permission for an abortion after she had been admitted to emergency rooms three times within a month for symptoms including cramping and fluid leaks. Her doctors advised her that due to her fetus' trisomy 18 diagnosis, the unborn baby had ""virtually no chance of surviving."" More than 95% of babies with the condition do not make it to birth, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

Cox's doctors also advised her that continuing the pregnancy posed serious risks to her health and fertility, according to the complaint, including increasing her chances of developing gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, uterine rupture from Caesarean section and post-operative infections.

More:Kate Cox can't get abortion for now, Texas Supreme Court says, halting lower court's OK

Finding that Cox needed an abortion immediately ""to preserve her life, health, and fertility,"" District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble issued a temporary restraining order barring the state, Paxton and the Texas Medical Board from prosecuting Cox, her husband, her doctor or her doctor's staff should Cox terminate the pregnancy.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Gamble said during the Thursday hearing.

Hours after the Travis County District Court issued its order barring the state from enforcing its abortion bans, Paxton issued a letter to hospitals where Karsan, Cox's OB-GYN, held privileges saying the order didn't protect them from potential legal action.

He then brought the case before the Texas Supreme Court by petitioning for a writ of mandamus, an extraordinary measure that would stop Cox from legally terminating her pregnancy in Texas. The high court put a hold on the district court's temporary restraining order late Friday night, essentially blocking the abortion authorization until the justices could review the case's merits.

Paxton and the state argued that Cox did not fall within the state's abortion ban exception because, in the attorney general's consideration, risks to her health were not strictly life-threatening.

""Because the life of an unborn child is at stake, the Court should require a faithful application of Texas statutes prior to determining that an abortion is permitted,"" Paxton's petition states.

Cox, a mother of two, was 20 weeks and six days pregnant as of Monday. She had been admitted to a fourth emergency room since filing the lawsuit, according to her attorneys' response to Paxton's appeal.

Nancy Northrup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Cox in the suit, said Cox had no choice but to leave the state to get the procedure.

Cox ""desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family,"" Northup said. ""While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.""

'Medically necessary care'

Less than an hour before Cox was reported to have left the state Monday, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine had filed a joint emergency amicus curiae brief to the Supreme Court of Texas stating that ""Ms. Cox faces a current, emergent threat to her life, health, and future fertility, and to the wellbeing of her family.""

The brief also states that Texas' abortion laws and Paxton's threats of enforcement of strict penalties against physicians leave medical personnel unable to provide essential care. The group has filed a brief that makes similar arguments in Zurawski v. Texas.

""Texas clinicians, like Dr. Karsan, must be permitted to provide abortions to pregnant patients, like Ms. Cox, in medically complex cases to protect them from negative health outcomes,"" the brief states. ""Every day that the Texas abortion bans remain in effect, they are preventing the provision of medically necessary care to state residents."""
Nov 10 2023,Ohio GOP declares war on their constituents; plans to circumvent abortion amendment,Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/11/10/2204994/-Ohio-GOP-declares-war-on-their-constituents-plans-to-circumvent-abortion-amendment,"Well, that didn’t take long. Ohio Republicans hold a supermajority in the legislature, and they hate, hate, HATE that these annoying people whom they are technically supposed to serve keep getting in the way of their agenda. The people spoke loud and clear that they wanted reproductive freedom in Ohio, so what does the House do? Make an announcement on their legislative official website that they aren’t going to listen.

RELATED STORY: Ohio Republicans lay plans to overturn this week's election

In its entirety:

DECEPTIVE OHIO ISSUE 1 MISLED THE PUBLIC BUT DOESN'T REPEAL OUR LAWS COLUMBUS, OH - Ohio Legislators will be introducing several bills to address this issue in the coming weeks. “Foreign billionaires don't get to make Ohio laws,” said Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester), pointing to millions from billionaires outside America that helped fund Issue 1. Gross added, “This is foreign election interference, and it will not stand.” “Issue 1 doesn't repeal a single Ohio law, in fact, it doesn't even mention one,” said Representative Bill Dean (R-Xenia). “The amendment’s language is dangerously vague and unconstrained and can be weaponized to attack parental rights or defend rapists, pedophiles, and human traffickers.” Melanie Miller (R-Ashland) said, “We will continue to be a voice for every child in their mother's womb who cannot speak for themselves.” Representative Beth Lear (R-Galena) stated, “No amendment can overturn the God given rights with which we were born.” To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts with Issue 1, Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative. The Ohio legislature alone will consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws based on public hearings and input from legal experts on both sides.

They have already been meeting to determine how to limit the impact of this important constitutional amendment that received close to 60% support. The Ohio House Speaker, Republican Jason Stephens, said the legislature has “multiple paths” to circumvent the amendment.

They have promised to strip the judiciary of their right to interpret abortion rights. A Cleveland State University professor, Dr. Abigail Moncrieff, said she expects that this gerrymandered supermajority GOP legislature will “re-define” terms in the amendment. For example, even though the amendment says doctors must be free to determine viability without interference, the legislature may try to define “viability” to be at anywhere from 15-21 weeks. They may also try to define other terms, like “health” of the mother, in very narrow terms to make it pointless.

Another option they are exploring is putting yet another constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2024 to ban abortion at 15 weeks—and this time begrudgingly have it include exceptions for rape and incest. (I doubt they will do this one since they know it will be defeated and drive up turnout.)

It was pointed out to me that although abortion amendments that restore a woman’s right to control her own body have been dominating in red states across the land, no Republican governor has lost their seat since Roe v. Wade was overturned. Being from Florida, I can tell you that the populace here always supports progressive amendments, albeit minimum wage, marijuana access, anti-gerrymandering, public school funding, environmental issues, etc. Yet the exact same populace allows Republicans to dominate our legislature, and then wonders why the things they voted for don’t come to fruition. It’s not enough to pass abortion legislation protecting women’s health care if the people left in charge are hellbent against it.

Disingenuous legislators will always pass laws to circumvent what they don’t want, and governors will appoint judges to weaken it in the courts. The hard reality is that the GOP no longer believes in democracy, and many Republicans are openly calling for authoritarianism. It is long past time we gave Republican lawmakers the benefit of the doubt to administer the will of the people in good faith. They need to be out of power. The sooner, the better.

Nov 09 2023,"Ohio, Indiana's latest neighbor to embed abortion rights in state constitution",ABC 57,center,https://abc57.com/news/ohio-indianas-latest-neighbor-to-embed-abortion-rights-in-state-constitution,"Ohio, Indiana's latest neighbor to embed abortion rights in state constitution

SOUTH BEND, Ind - Ohio just became Indiana's latest neighbor to pass an amendment embedding abortion rights in its state constitution.

“It's a very chilling amendment because it legalizes abortion through all 9 months of pregnancy for essentially any reason, and if you're a minor, you can have an abortion without parental notification,"" said Melanie Garcia Lyon, Executive Director of Voices for Life

Indiana has essentially become an island in terms of abortion rights, with neighboring states like Ohio, Illinois, and Michigan all having unrestricted access to abortion care.

This past Tuesday, Ohioans voted to pass Proposal One, which is an amendment that enshrines abortion care and other reproductive health measures into the state's constitution.

The controversial near-total abortion ban in Indiana comes with strict requirements and few exceptions for getting an abortion, like if the mother's health is at risk, the fetus has a fatal abnormality, or in cases of rape and incest.

the CEO of Planned Parenthood of Kentucky and Indiana, Rebecca Gibron, says they do provide resources to patients looking for care outside the state.

“The political landscape that extreme politicians in Indiana have created definitely force Hoosiers to leave their home communities and leave their home state to access basic healthcare,"" said Gibron.

That Ohio abortion amendment will go into effect starting December 7."
Aug 08 2023,The Abortion Backlash Reaches Ohio,The Atlantic,left,https://theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957,"Officially, abortion had nothing to do with the constitutional amendment that Ohio voters rejected today. The word appeared nowhere on the ballot, and no abortion laws will change as a result of the outcome.

Practically and politically, however, the defeat of the ballot initiative known as Issue 1 was all about abortion, giving reproductive-rights advocates the latest in a series of victories in the year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Fearing the passage of an abortion-rights amendment in November, Republicans in Ohio asked voters to approve a proposal that would raise the threshold for enacting a change to the state constitution, which currently requires a simple majority vote. The measure on the ballot today would have lifted the threshold to 60 percent.

Ohio voters, turning out in unusually large numbers for a summertime special election, declined. Their decision was a rare victory for Democrats in a state that Republicans have dominated, and it suggests that abortion remains a strong motivator for voters heading into next year’s presidential election. The Ohio results could spur abortion-rights advocates to ramp up their efforts to circumvent Republican-controlled state legislatures by placing the issue directly before voters. They have reason to feel good about their chances: Since the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, statewide abortion-rights ballot measures have been undefeated, winning in blue states such as Vermont and California as well as in red states such as Kansas and Kentucky.

In Kansas last summer, an 18-point victory by the abortion-rights side stunned members of both parties in a socially conservative state. By the final day of voting in Ohio, however, the defeat of Issue 1 could no longer be called a surprise. For weeks, Democrats who had become accustomed to disappointment in Ohio watched early-voting numbers soar in the state’s large urban and suburban counties. If Republicans had hoped to catch voters napping by scheduling the election for the dog days of August, they miscalculated. As I traveled the state recently, I saw Vote No signs in front yards and outside churches in areas far from major cities, and progressive organizers told me that volunteers were signing up to knock on doors at levels unheard of for a summer campaign. The opposition extended to some independent and Republican voters, who saw the proposal as taking away their rights. “It’s this ‘Don’t tread on me’ moment where voters are being activated,” says Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a good-government advocacy group that helped lead the effort to defeat the amendment.

Opponents of Issue 1 assembled a bipartisan coalition that included two former Republican governors. They focused their message broadly, appealing to voters to “protect majority rule” and stop a brazen power grab by the legislature. But the special election’s obvious link to this fall’s abortion referendum in Ohio drove people to the polls, particularly women and younger voters. “Voters don’t spend a lot of time thinking about the Ohio constitution. They probably don’t spend a ton of time thinking about voting rights,” Turcer told me. But, she said, “the attempt to dilute voter power so that it would impact a vote on reproductive rights made it really concrete, and that was important.”

Voters in South Dakota and Arkansas last year rejected similar GOP-driven efforts to make ballot initiatives harder to pass. But Ohio’s status as a large former swing state that has turned red over the past decade posed a unique test for Democrats who are desperate to revive their party in the state. “We’ve been beat in Ohio a lot,” Dennis Willard, a longtime party operative in the state who served as the lead spokesperson for the No campaign, told me. That Republicans tried to pass this amendment, he said, “is a testament to them believing that they’re invincible and that we cannot beat them.”

The defeat of Issue 1 likely clears the way for voters this fall to guarantee abortion access in Ohio, and it will keep open an avenue for progressives to enshrine, with a simple majority vote, other policies in the state constitution—including marijuana legalization and a higher minimum wage—that they could not get through a legislature controlled by Republicans. Democrats, including Willard, are eying an amendment to curb the gerrymandering that has helped the GOP lock in their majorities. They also hope that tonight’s victory will put Ohio back on the political map. “Us winning sends a message to the rest of the country that Ohio has possibilities,” Willard said. “And winning in November demonstrates to people that you can’t write Ohio off anymore.”

For the moment, though, the GOP is in little danger of losing its hold on the state. It controls supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature; the Republican governor, Mike DeWine, trounced his Democratic opponent by 25 points last year to win a second term. One Ohio Republican, speaking anonymously before today’s election, told me that the defeat of Issue 1 and the expected passage of the reproductive-rights amendment in November could actually help the party next year, because voters might no longer believe that abortion access is in danger in the state. (The GOP performed better last year in blue states such as New York and California, where abortion rights were not under serious threat.)

Republicans in Ohio, and in other states where similar ballot measures have flopped, are now confronting the limits of their power and the point at which voters will rebel. Will they be chastened and recalibrate, or will they continue to push the boundaries? It’s a question the proponents of Issue 1 did not want to contemplate before the votes confirming their defeat were counted. Their critics, however, are doubtful that Republicans will shift their strategy. “It’s unlikely that they will stop right away,” Turcer said. “It will take a number of defeats before they’re likely to understand that voters do not want to be taken advantage of.”"
Nov 09 2023,Ohio Just the Beginning of Pro-Abortion Activists’ Ballot Measure Crusade,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/11/09/ohio-just-beginning-pro-abortion-activists-ballot-measure-crusade,"Ohio is the latest state trounced by pro-abortion activists after the fall of Roe v. Wade last year, with voters choosing to codify the “right” to abortion in their state constitution on Tuesday.

After the fall of Roe, which had invented a federal “right” to abortion in the Constitution, abortion was returned to individual states and their elected representatives, changing the nature of the struggle between the pro-life movement and the abortion industry. Pro-abortion organizations and activists, backed by the affiliates of large left-wing organizations like Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have stealthily turned to ballot measures in the hopes of shoring up and even growing the abortion complex in the shift from federal to state power.

And so far, their plan is working — every single abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. During the 2022 special elections, Kansans rejected a ballot measure that would have established that the state constitution does not include a right to abortion. During the 2022 midterms, voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont codified abortion into their constitutions. At the same time, voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have given rights to babies born alive in botched abortions. Voters in Kentucky also rejected an amendment similar to the one in Kansas.

Ballot measures are particularly effective as an offensive weapon because they are basically irreversible: they change a state constitution, take precedence over laws passed by state legislatures, and can only be overturned by another ballot measure.

These measures are propped up by national left-wing organizations with deep pockets, out-of-state dark money groups, and billionaires with eugenicist leanings, often times outspending pro-life organizations by double or triple. For example, in Ohio, campaign filings from Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights show they brought in nearly $29 million from donors since Sept. 8. Meanwhile, pro-life groups rallying against the measure raised just under $10 million in the same period.

These multi-million-dollar campaigns are carefully crafted, ignoring bigger ethical questions and gruesome details about what abortion really is, and instead pitching amendments as a means of codifying “freedom” and creating a bulwark against government overreach. The ballot measures are also often broadly worded, leaving voters confused about just how far-reaching they may be.

Pro-abortion groups pushing the Ohio amendment dumped significant sums into framing a “yes” vote on Issue 1 as a vote for “freedom,” and invoked conservative imagery, opposition to government overreach, and mentions of “faith” and “family” to convince Ohioans to support the killing of the unborn. Pro-abortion groups successfully employed a similar strategy in the 2022 midterms, when abortion was on the ballot in states like Kansas and Michigan. The pro-abortion groups pushing these amendments also capitalize off of fear, telling women lies such as they will not be able to access miscarriage care if pro-life laws are passed.

Emboldened by their success with amendments, pro-abortion activists are seeking to introduce ballot measures in several other states going into 2024, so far including Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, and South Dakota.

In the aftermath of 2022 and now Ohio, pro-life organizations say they are reevaluating how they want to tackle the issue moving forward — especially as they gear up to face a tsunami of ballot measures in 2024. These organizations, which cut their teeth for 50 years while working toward the overturn of Roe, are ultimately faced with the challenge of becoming as strategic and well-funded as their opponents, while refusing to compromise on the view that human life begins at conception and is worthy of protection until natural death.

“The pro-life movement must adapt to win. We have to throw out the old playbook and dive headfirst into a strategy that can win the hearts and minds of the American people and translate into electoral victory,” founder and president of Live Action Lila Rose said in a statement via email following the loss in Ohio. “That strategy starts with fully embracing and educating on the truth. Human life is valuable and must be legally protected. Human life begins at fertilization. Abortion is a murderous act of violence. Embracing the truth with courage is the first step towards the next political victory.”

“It is a tragedy that the people of Ohio, and the many states before and to follow them, were asked to vote on the legality of discriminately killing a class of persons based on their age,” Rose noted:

This is a class of persons, our youngest children, who have no vote and cannot advocate for themselves. When, and under what conditions, should the rule of the majority be curtailed to protect the rights of the minority? The first and most obvious answer is to protect the most fundamental human rights of the minority, most importantly, the right to life.

Rose contended that “truth will ultimately prevail” because “truth always trumps temporary political victories.”

She said:

What is the truth? Human life begins at the moment of fertilization. Abortion is an act of homicidal violence that kills a living human person. A civilized nation prohibits homicide and should, of course, prohibit abortion. A bedrock of our legal system is the equal protection of our laws for every person, regardless of race, age, location, or social status. That guarantee of equal protection is enshrined in our Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment. It is anathemic to vote on the basic human rights of defenseless, unpopular minorities — especially children. In the United States today, preborn children may be the most unpopular minority.

Leading pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also released a statement via email in the Ohio aftermath, saying that “there have been many valuable lessons learned from Issue 1.”

“Moving forward in states where abortion will be on the ballot in 2024, pro-life, pro-woman coalitions will need to devote more resources to compassionate pro-life messages for women and their children, combatting the campaign of fear from the other side,” the group wrote.

In OH, pro-abortion forces outspent pro-life forces by 2:1 in a campaign centered on lies & deception. The GOP must:

Students for Life Action president Kristan Hawkins noted via email that the pro-life movement is “in a marathon, not a sprint.”

“Making a case for LIFE on the human rights issue of our day – abortion – will not be finished in a single election cycle,” Hawkins said.

“In Ohio, and really everywhere in the country, abortion profiteers first sell women short, and then they sell them an abortion. Those making billions by selling abortion used fear to undercut women and to convince them that they are not enough,” she continued. “Our work remains the same: Create a safety net for women and their children, born and preborn, and Build a framework for legal protections for women and preborn children.”

So in Ohio you can now kill a baby up until the moment of birth for any reason and then smoke weed to try to erase your pain. Horrific. — Kristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) November 8, 2023

“Ballot initiatives are tricky and clearly, we have work to do in educating voters on the human rights issue of our day – abortion — but the same pro-life movement that worked almost 50 years to undo the wrongs of Roe v. Wade will not be discouraged. Win or lose, our work continues,” she added.

Jul 12 2023,Lawsuit filed to block 6-week abortion ban by ALCU and abortion providers,Iowa State Daily,center,https://iowastatedaily.com/278581/news/lawsuit-filed-to-block-6-week-abortion-ban-by-alcu-and-abortion-providers,"Planned Parenthood, the Emma Goldman Clinic and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Iowa held a virtual media conference Wednesday to address the lawsuit they are filing to block the 6-week abortion bill that was passed Tuesday night.

A motion for temporary injunction will be made at 1:30 p.m. Friday through the Iowa District Court at the Polk County courthouse. This comes just 45 minutes before Gov. Kim Reynolds is expected to sign the bill, which would be effective immediately.

Their goal is not to stop the signing but to block the enforcement of the law. If the bill is blocked, Iowans would be able to access abortion up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.

“This law is deeply cruel and callously puts the lives and health of Iowans at risk,” said Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa.

The legal claims behind the lawsuit are that this bill violates constitutional rights of Iowans to abortion and substantive due process, according to Austen. She also said this bill violates article one section one of Iowa’s constitution, the inalienable right clause. They are also making an equal protection claim.

“We’re seeking to block this bill because we know that every day that the law is in effect, Iowans will face life threatening barriers to getting desperately needed medical care,” Austen said. “The Iowa politicians who voted for this have put their own political expediency over the will of the people, as well as Iowans’ rights to bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom, their health and their safety.”

Austen said this law bans abortion before most people know they are pregnant, and the exceptions come with barriers. Exceptions include cases of rape, incest, medical emergencies and protecting the life of the pregnant person.

“The experiences of patients and providers across the country have demonstrated that these so-called exceptions, like those in the ban that was passed [Tuesday], are totally unworkable,” Austen said. “They put patients’ lives at risk and further deprive people of their reproductive freedom.”

Ruth Richardson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood North Central States, said this ban is “devastating, harmful and irresponsible.” She said exceptions to the ban show the false belief that only certain people deserve health care.

“This ban inappropriately inserts politicians into exam rooms and puts doctors in extremely difficult positions,” Richardson said.

Planned Parenthood will be continuing to perform abortions within the guidelines and will help provide resources to patients who may need to travel out of state.

Richardson said abortion patient navigators have helped over 1,600 people get to their appointments across five states, including Texas and Louisiana. Abortion patient navigators help eliminate any barriers that may come with traveling for an abortion, including paying for gas, flights and childcare.

According to Richardson, Planned Parenthood has seen a 200% increase in Iowans traveling to Minnesota for reproductive healthcare.

“We are fully hoping for relief from the court, and we’re hoping that we won’t have any interruption in providing care, we certainly acknowledge that [canceling appointments] is a possibility,” said Peter Im, staff attorney at Planned Parenthood Federation of America.

During the weeks of July 10 and July 17, there are 200 patients between Planned Parenthood of the Heartland in Iowa and the Emma Goldman Clinic, according to Im. In 2022, over 4,000 abortions were performed between the two clinics. Im said Planned Parenthood and other providers have “moved mountains” to see as many people as possible for care.

“I think it’s important to note that abortion is incredibly safe and incredibly common,” Im said. “There are statistics that say that nearly one in four women, by the time she reaches the age of 45, gets an abortion, and that doesn’t include all of the trans and gender non-conforming and non-binary people who also get abortions.”

Richardson said that personal medical decisions, like abortion, being made by politicians with no medical expertise is an “egregious overreach of power.”

Richardson said this ban will disproportionately affect communities who are already marginalized. She said many people are unable to travel to another state—including people with disabilities, people in rural areas, young people and those with low income—taking away many Iowans’ access to full sexual and reproductive healthcare.

“These communities face a reality, under this law, in which they will be forced into pregnancy,” Richardson said.

Im said that full consideration was not given when passing this bill. He referenced the Senate’s special session lasting less than a day and the debate in both chambers lasting less than seven hours.

Since the courts blocked the 2018 abortion bill, Im feels confident that the Iowa Supreme Court will follow precedent. Im said no matter what happens at the district court, he would be surprised if it did not go to the Iowa Supreme Court.

“We’re committed to this fight to protect Iowans’ reproductive freedom and ability to make what should be private medical decisions between a person, their doctor, their family and their faith,” Richardson said. “Today and always, we stand with Iowans and will never back down until control over bodily autonomy is returned to the people of Iowa.”"
Nov 09 2023,Arkansas political activist behind Ohio abortion measure passed Tuesday,Fox16,center,https://fox16.com/news/politics/arkansas-political-activist-behind-ohio-abortion-measure-passed-tuesday,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – Ohio voters passed an issue earlier this week to enshrine abortion access into the state constitution, and behind the effort was one Arkansan.

“What I saw in Ohio was a pushback against government interference in the lives of everyday Ohioans,” Judson Scanlon said.

For Scanlon, the issue is an important one. Coming from Arkansas, which is said to be the most pro-life state in the nation, Scanlon said it has always been an uphill battle to fight for reproductive rights.

“Frankly, there’s a part of me that likes to think of this as getting a little revenge,” Scanlon said in an interview Thursday.

“We had two elections to actually contest in,” Scanlon said. “The first election was the issue that changed the passage and requirements to 60% and the second issue was passing the abortion rights.”

Despite hurdles, and Ohio being a red state with a mostly Republican legislature and Republican governor, the abortion measure passed Tuesday.

The issue legalizes abortions up until the point of fetal viability, meaning at the point where the fetus is said to have a likelihood of survival outside the womb.

It provides exceptions for cases in which the doctor determines the life or health of the woman is at risk.

On Wednesday, FOX 16 News interviewed Jerry Cox with Arkansas Family Council. Cox emphasized the need for the pro-life community to step up in times like these for women facing unplanned pregnancies.

“We need to do a really good job of helping people come to an understanding of what it means to be pro-life and then we have to stand to help women and girls who have an unplanned pregnancy and be sure that they have good alternatives and they’re not backed into a corner feeling like an abortion is their only choice,” Cox said.

The past few years, the Arkansas legislature has appropriated $1 million for organizations helping women with unplanned pregnancies, following the state’s near-total abortion ban.

Cox and Scanlon both said they believe the messaging is becoming more important for both sides of the issue, so people really understand what both sides mean.

Scanlon said while it will be an uphill battle, the belief is there could be a similar issue on Arkansas ballots in the future.

Though Scanlon said Arkansas voters do support this measure, it also needs institutional support, so the next steps will focus on gaining that.

“We just have a lot of work to get there,” Scanlon said. “Government interference in our lives is the issue here.”"
Nov 08 2023,Unlimited Abortion on Demand Comes to Ohio After Voters Approve Issue 1,Daily Citizen,right,https://dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com/unlimited-abortion-on-demand-comes-to-ohio-after-voters-approve-issue-1,"Ohio voters overwhelming approved Issue 1 in Tuesday night’s election, bringing unlimited abortion on demand to the Buckeye State.

Issue 1, which establishes a constitutional right to abortion, was approved by Ohio voters 57% to 43%, with over 95% of the results reporting.

The measure legalizes abortion up until birth, ends common sense laws protecting women’s health during the abortion process, and removes parental notification requirements for minors seeking to obtain abortions. It will also likely permit minors to access transgender medical interventions without their parents’ knowledge or consent.

Supporters of Issue 1 gathered at an election night watch part in Columbus, Ohio, hosted by Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights. Abortion rights supporters cheered, applauded, and cried joyfully as they watched the election results come in; they were applauding unlimited, unrestricted, unregulated abortion on demand up until birth.

Pro-life supporters will be analyzing the results of Tuesday’s election for a while seeking the best path forward. But several pro-life leaders provided their initial thoughts on the defeat.

In a statement following the election, Focus on the Family President Jim Daly called last night’s results “disappointing.”

“[The result] makes clear it’s essential that the critical work of the pro-life movement must carry on with renewed energy and enthusiasm,” Daly said, adding,

No popular vote and no politician can make right the tragic wrong of abortion. This campaign is unlike any other. It’s a rescue mission. We’re determined to rescue women from the lies of an industry that has managed to convince a slim majority of Americans that death is somehow better than life.

Ethic and Public Theology Professor Andrew T. Walker posted his thoughts on X, formerly known as Twitter:

We won a generational legal argument in overturning Roe, but the teaching effect of a fifty year law to etch a lie about what human life is and when it begins has reaped tragic and generational consequences to reverse. “And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season… — Andrew T. Walker (@andrewtwalk) November 8, 2023

Lila Rose, president of Live Action, posted a lengthy thread on X.

“The pro-life movement must adapt to win,” Rose said, adding,

We have to throw out the old playbook and dive headfirst into a strategy that can win the hearts and minds of the American people and translate into electoral victory. That strategy starts with fully embracing and educating on the truth.

While life lost on Tuesday in Ohio, all pro-life leaders – and the pro-life movement – share this common conviction: We will continue the fight to protect preborn life no matter the cost.

Oct 27 2023,Satanic Temple Loses Lawsuit Against Indiana Abortion Ban,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/satanic-temple-loses-lawsuit-against-indiana-abortion-ban,"The Satanic Temple lost its lawsuit against Indiana’s abortion ban on Wednesday when a federal judge threw out the suit.

In her decision, Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson pointed out that the Satanic Temple does not run any abortion clinics in Indiana and failed to disclose any specific Satanic Temple members who are being affected by the ban.

“In sum, the Satanic Temple’s allegations fail to prove it has suffered any injury in fact,” the judge wrote.

The Satanic Temple sued in September 2022, alleging the abortion ban violates their members’ religious rights and is unconstitutional. Indiana’s abortion ban prohibits abortion at any point of pregnancy except when the woman’s life or health is seriously at risk, in cases of rape or incest, or when there is a “lethal fetal abnormality.”

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita called the lawsuit “ridiculous” and said the win “sustains a pro-life law that is constitutionally and legally sound” in a statement Thursday.

“We Hoosiers continue to build a solid culture of life whether satanic cultists like it or not,” Rokita said.

Pro-life advocates quickly praised the decision as well.

“BIG win for LIFE! If your ‘religion’ involves killing babies, you should find another religion,” posted Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America.

The Satanic Temple’s attorney said he was disappointed in the decision. It is not clear whether the group will appeal.

“It takes a desperate and irresponsible judge to refuse to hear our case because of a baffling refusal to accept that any of our membership in Indiana may get pregnant in the future,” said Lucien Greaves, co-founder of the Satanic Temple.

The Satanic Temple has about 11,300 members in Indiana. Despite its name, members of The Satanic Temple do not actually believe in Satan — rather it is an atheist group that seeks to subvert Christianity’s role in American life. The group believes that “one’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone,” which includes a belief in abortion.

The Satanic Temple does not run any abortion clinics in Indiana, but it did launch a telehealth clinic out of New Mexico last year called “Samuel Alito’s Mom’s Satanic Abortion Clinic,” a reference to the conservative Supreme Court justice.

The telehealth abortion clinic says it provides abortion medication through the mail to Satanic Temple members in New Mexico.

Last year, The Satanic Temple sponsored “After School Satan” clubs, saying the clubs were a response to the Christian Good News Clubs at public schools across the country."
Nov 08 2023,"Ohioans back abortion rights, recreational marijuana at the polls : Capitol Letter",Cleveland Plain Dealer,center,https://cleveland.com/open/2023/11/ohioans-back-abortion-rights-recreational-marijuana-at-the-polls-capitol-letter.html,"Rotunda Rumblings

Issue advocacy: Ohio voters delivered a rare statewide victory for progressives on Tuesday when they passed a pair of statewide issues guaranteeing abortion rights and legalizing recreational marijuana. In an election that drew national attention, Ohio both issues racked up big early voting advantages that helped them cruise to victory on election night and end a bitter campaign over abortion access that drew millions of dollars in outside spending on both sides.

Abortion rights win: With the passage of Issue 1, Ohio became the seventh state to back abortion rights in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in the summer of 2022. Laura Hancock reports that the language that will be added to the Ohio Constitution protects individuals’ decisions about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, miscarriage care and fertility treatment until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. Then the General Assembly would be allowed to regulate reproductive decisions. But women would still be allowed to get an abortion after viability if in the professional judgement of her physician it’s needed to protect her life or health.

Puff puff passed: Voters also approved Issue 2, a proposed law that legalizes the growing and use of recreational marijuana within certain limits, Laura Hancock reports. The passage of Issue 2 means Ohioans can start growing marijuana next month, and backers expect retail sales to start as soon as next August.

Not so fast: Both Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman and House Speaker Jason Stephens issued statements after Tuesday’s vote suggesting plans to roll back what the voters want. Jake Zuckerman reports the statements ranged from vague paths to “explore” ways to “protect innocent life,” plans to repeal Issue 1 outright, and to tinker with where the marijuana tax revenue goes. Gov. Mike DeWine declined to weigh in.

Voters rebuke GOP: Tuesday’s election results spotlights a major divide between Ohio’s Republican legislative leaders, who have charted an increasingly conservative course on social issues like abortion, and the state’s general electorate. Andrew Tobias drills down on Ohio’s lack of competitive Republican-leaning legislative districts as a major factor in the disconnect, among other reasons.

Absent ballots: The election didn’t go off entirely without its hitches. Tobias reports that voting-rights advocates said Tuesday that they had heard from students, including “dozens” at Ohio State University, who said they never got the mail ballot they requested for Tuesday’s election. Voters who request an absentee ballot still had the chance to vote in person on Election Day with a provisional ballot.

Party time: An Ohio Supreme Court justice on Tuesday sued state officials over a law that requires candidates for the state’s high court and for appeals courts to be listed on the ballot with party affiliations. Adam Ferrise reports that Jennifer Brunner, a Columbiana County Democrat, filed the lawsuit in federal court in Youngstown. She is seeking an injunction to stop the new law from affecting future ballots. The 2021 law upended the practice in Ohio that Supreme Court and appeals court candidates run without party affiliations in general elections. The judges always ran in partisan primaries, but never with affiliations in the general election.

Flyby: U.S. Rep. Max Miller, a Rocky River Republican who is a member of the House Committee on Agriculture introduced legislation called the “Farm to Fly Act” that would foster development of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) within existing U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs, allow for greater collaboration, and ensure USDA’s SAF definitions reflect eligibility for American agricultural crops. “It will provide access to new markets for our nation’s farmers, it will drive rural economic development, and it will strengthen our domestic energy resources,” said Miller, who introduced the bill Tuesday with a bipartisan group of legislators.

Foreign aid: U.S. Sen. JD Vance, a Cincinnati Republican who wants Congress to separately consider aid to Ukraine and Israel, was disappointed that Democrats who control the U.S. Senate did not sign off on his “unanimous consent request” to advance the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act that the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved last week. “The President’s Ukraine policy, just like the Israeli policy, should be debated,” Vance said on the Senate floor. “We should talk about it. We should discuss it. We should separate the costs and benefits and analyze them as distinct policies, because that is what the American people deserve of their legislature.”

Home sweet home: The uptick in parents who pulled their children out of brick-and-mortar schools for homeschooling during the pandemic has largely sustained itself in the 2022-2023 school year, according to a story and analysis by the Washington Post, which called thousands of public school districts across the country. In Ohio, homeschool enrollment went up by 54% since the 2017-2018 school year. Across the country, homeschool enrollment growth has been faster than private school enrollment growth.

Lobbying Lineup

Five organizations lobbying on Senate Bill 47, a Republican-sponsored bill that would prohibit state and local governments from allowing a provision in a collective bargaining agreement granting paid leave to employees who want to perform election activities or lobbying on behalf of an employee organization. The bill was introduced in February but has had no hearings.

Ohio voters approved a ballot measure that will amend the constitution to make abortion a constitutional right, drawing strong reactions from supporters and critics to what is seen as a blow to the pro-life movement.

With 99% of the vote reporting, 56.6% of Ohio voters supported Issue 1, while 43.4% rejected it. The text of Issue 1 declares that ""Every individual has a right to make and carry out one's reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on (1) contraception; (2) fertility treatment; (3) continuing one's own pregnancy; (4) miscarriage care; and (5) abortion.""

Although the now-passed constitutional amendment states that ""abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability,"" referring to the point in pregnancy where an unborn baby can survive outside the womb, it clarifies that ""in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician, it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient's life or health.""

This provision of the amendment has led to concern from pro-life advocates that it will essentially lead to the legalization of abortion up until birth in Ohio.

Tuesday's election comes after a referendum put before Ohio voters in August asking them to approve increasing the threshold required to pass a constitutional amendment from a simple majority to 60% failed.

The August ballot question, also named Issue 1, received support from pro-life advocacy groups. Had August's version of Issue 1 passed, Tuesday's abortion referendum would have failed to secure the votes necessary to enshrine a right to abortion in the state constitution.

Ohio has become the fourth state to approve a constitutional right to abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court determined in the June 2022 Dobbs v. Women's Health Organization ruling that the U.S. Constitution does not contain a right to abortion. California, Michigan and Vermont voted in favor of similar ballot measures last year. Unlike all of the other states where voters have opted to establish a constitutional right to abortion, Ohio supported Republican former President Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Ohio also differs from the other states because it passed pro-life protections into law, although the six-week abortion ban approved by the state government was put on hold by the courts at the time of the referendum. The pro-life group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America estimates that the six-week abortion ban, which is now overruled by Issue 1, would prevent an estimated 14,910 abortions from taking place on an annual basis.

According to AdImpact, which keeps track of money spent on political campaigns in the U.S., opponents of Issue 1 spent $16.3 million leading up to Tuesday's election, while supporters of Issue 1 spent $24.4 million.

While pro-life activists expressed profound disappointment at Tuesday's election results, pro-abortion advocacy organizations celebrated the development. Here are five reactions to the passage of Issue 1."

WASHINGTON, DC — A proposal to enshrine abortion rights in Ohio's Constitution was approved in a statewide election Tuesday, with a significant number of Republicans joining with Democrats to ensure the measure's passage.

The Associated Press has called the race, with votes cast in favor of proposal winning with about 56% of the vote, compared with about 44% for votes cast in opposition — a lead of approximately 232,000 votes as of the latest tally. Known as ""Issue 1,"" the proposal would amend the state Constitution to establish the right to ""make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions"" on matters including abortion, contraception and fertility treatment. It would also allow for abortions to be banned once it has been established that the fetus can survive outside of the womb, unless a physician determines that continuing with the pregnancy would endanger the patient's ""life or health.""

Tuesday's vote followed a similar path as an August ballot measure election that would have raised the threshold to amend the state Constitution from a simple majority to 60% of the statewide vote. The August measure, which failed 57% to 43%, did not mention abortion or reproductive rights specifically but quickly became a proxy fight over reproductive rights as it would have made it more difficult for Tuesday's measure to pass. In this election, the more than 836,000 advance votes cast by mail or in-person before Election Day broke heavily in favor of the amendment, with Yes votes receiving roughly 63%, compared with 37% for No votes. This is not surprising, considering Ohio Democrats campaigned heavily in favor of Issue 1, and pre-Election Day voting tends to skew heavily Democratic.

The Yes side also appeared to have a slight lead among votes cast on Election Day, which is notable because Election Day votes have tended to favor Republicans ever since Donald Trump discouraged advance voting in his failed 2020 reelection bid. The No side initially led in the Election Day vote on Tuesday evening in the early stages of vote-counting, but that advantage steadily eroded. When the AP called the race, the No side was still ahead among Election Day voters but not by enough to offset the advantage the Yes side had amassed in the pre-Election Day advance votes.

The scope of the victory for the Yes side suggests that a significant number of Republicans voted in favor of Issue 1. While the No side appears to have won all 44 of the counties Trump won in 2020 with more than 70% of the vote, the Yes side won 9 of the 10 counties that Trump won with less than 60% of the vote. Yes was also leading in a third of the counties that Trump carried, with between 60% and 70% of the vote. The No side trailed Trump's performance in every county in the state except for Putnam, as of the latest tally. Yes votes had an overwhelming lead in areas President Joe Biden won in 2020, as expected. The pro-abortion rights forces appear to have scored a broader victory geographically than they did in the August ballot measure vote. Yes was leading in 21 of the 22 counties that the pro-abortion rights position won in August and also prevailed in a handful of additional counties that previously sided with the abortion rights foes.

Yes had comfortable leads in the counties making up the metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus and Youngstown, mirroring the August vote. No was ahead in Dayton and appears to have picked up Toledo, which voted with abortion rights supporters in August. Ohio is the latest state to put the question of abortion rights directly to voters. It's also the latest state where voters decided either in favor of protecting access to abortion or against placing further restrictions on the procedure. In 2022, voters in California, Michigan and Vermont approved state constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights, while voters in Kansas and Kentucky rejected measures to amend their state constitutions to restrict the procedure. Montana voters also rejected a proposal that year backed by opponents of abortion rights. By Robert Yoon, Associated Press"
Nov 08 2023,Abortion & trans rights are safe in Virginia as Democrats take control of the legislature,LGBTQ Nation,left,https://lgbtqnation.com/2023/11/abortion-trans-rights-are-safe-in-virginia-as-democrats-take-control-of-the-legislature,"Last night, Virginia’s entire General Assembly was on the ballot – and Democrats managed to hang on to the state Senate and flip the House of Delegates. The results are a crushing blow to the GOP and the state’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who was counting on gaining control of the legislature to pass a 15-week abortion ban.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters across the country have repeatedly shown that Democrats win when reproductive rights are on the ballot, and Virginia was no exception. As Slate pointed out, Democratic control of the legislature means the party will not only be able to block legislation to limit reproductive rights but will also be able to jumpstart the process of proposing a state constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to abortion.

Virginia’s elections have also been viewed as a precursor to what might happen in the 2024 elections. As ABC News explained, the Democratic victory means the party will likely continue to campaign on abortion rights across the country. Meanwhile, Republicans are learning voters are rejecting their strategy of advocating so vehemently against abortion.

The Democratic victory in the legislature also means the rights of trans Virginians will be protected. Last year, 12 anti-trans bills were introduced by Republican lawmakers, but Democratic control of the state Senate meant none of them were able to pass. With Democrats now controlling both chambers, that streak should continue.

Another big win in Virginia last night came from trans trailblazer Del. Danica Roem (D), who will now officially become the first out trans person in the South to serve in a state senate after winning her senate campaign. Making her victory all the more sweet, Roem defeated vocally anti-trans Republican Bill Woolf.

This is Roem’s second time making history in Virginia. In 2017, she also became the first out trans person in the state elected to the House of Delegates. She was then reelected twice.

Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson told The Hill that Roem’s win is historic for both her and Virginia, but it is also so much more.

“I think for every queer person, for every trans person, for every person of color, for anyone that’s been at the margins, it is historic for all of the gains that we’re seeing happen.”"
Nov 07 2023,Election results point to major GOP liability on abortion heading into 2024,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/elections/election-results-point-major-gop-liability-abortion-heading-2024-rcna123103,"Abortion rights keep winning and winning at the ballot box — and on Tuesday, winning some more.

Nearly 17 months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the hot streak enjoyed by candidates and ballot measures backing abortion rights continued in a collection of states in very different places across the political spectrum.

In Ohio, the state constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights won by double digits, a year after Republicans swept the statewide offices that were up in the midterm elections. In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear won re-election after having made support of abortion rights a key message of his campaign in the deep red state. And in Virginia, Democrats kept their majority in the state Senate and flipped the state House — a substantive rebuke of Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who’d put a 15-week abortion ban at the center of his campaign to help the GOP win full control of government in what has become a blue-leaning state over the last decade.

The results are yet more evidence that heading into 2024, abortion rights remain a major political force for Democrats and a vulnerability for Republicans across the country, political strategists from both major parties said.

“Democrats have a message on abortion that’s more salient than Republicans’,” Republican strategist Alex Conant said. “And Republicans need to figure out a way to talk about abortion that can win independent voters in the center.”

Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson said it's not ""a question of Republicans retooling their message or finding a new slogan or trying to sell people on something that people don’t want.""

“We now have the 2022 midterms, the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, the other ballot measures, Kansas and tonight’s results,” Ferguson continued, rattling off the list of victories by abortion-rights supporters since Roe was overturned. “This is not some referendum on the status quo. This is people showing they’re worried about the consequences that come from extremism … in red states like Kentucky, purple states in Virginia and everything in between.""

It didn’t matter Tuesday whether abortion rights were explicitly on the ballot in a red-leaning state (Ohio), a feature of the Democratic candidate’s campaign in a ruby-red state (Kentucky) or the key issue of races in a blue-leaning one (Virginia). Whatever the level of prominence in the campaign, abortion rights won — and with broad support across various demographics.

In Ohio, for example, Issue 1 was supported by majorities of men, women, white voters, Black voters and Hispanic voters and across voters ages 18 to 64, according to NBC News exit polling.

Reproductive rights advocates noted that the issue helped propel candidates in other statewide races Tuesday, like a state Supreme Court race in Pennsylvania, where abortion rights was a central theme. A Democratic candidate won Tuesday night.

Meanwhile, in Virginia, Youngkin persuaded a broad slate of Republican candidates in the legislative races to coalesce behind his proposal for a ban on abortion after 15 weeks as part of his effort to gain Republican control of both chambers of the Legislature. Strategists and politics watchers, keenly aware of GOP struggles on abortion, saw the proposal — which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the woman — as a test message for Republicans looking for a more nuanced reproductive rights policy and message to run on in the post-Roe v. Wade era.

That didn’t work, either.

As a result, heading into 2024, Republicans still lack an effective way to counter messaging from Democrats who have bludgeoned them over their support of more restrictive abortion laws.

“Republicans have got to find the right place among voters. But they may not,” said Brandon Scholz, a GOP strategist in Wisconsin — where liberals won the majority on the state Supreme Court this year after their candidate made abortion rights a central pillar of her campaign.

“The Republican Party is just pretty well split on this issue,” Scholz said.

Nevertheless, some Republicans suggested there was one magic tool the GOP could use to work through its bind: Donald Trump.

Trump, of course, appointed the Supreme Court justices who tipped the court toward overturning Roe. But he has also proved harder to pin on abortion rights than many other Republicans, at times to his detriment among conservatives.

For example, Trump has criticized six-week state abortion bans as being “too harsh,” and he skipped a prominent conservative summit in Iowa, where Gov. Kim Reynolds signed such a ban alongside a half-dozen other Republican presidential candidates. He hasn’t articulated a specific position on abortion policy, though he has suggested at times that the issue be left to the states and has blamed GOP candidates’ hard-line positions for the party’s underperformance in the 2022 midterms.

Nevertheless, Trump remains far ahead in national polls of the GOP primary campaign and in the key early-voting state of Iowa — where conservative evangelical Christians are a key voting bloc — even though several candidates, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are running to his right on abortion.

The mounting losses on abortion rights could help advance an argument that Trump is uniquely positioned among Republicans in the presidential race to counter the narrative that the issue is a big loser for the party.

“I think this is likely why Trump has really hedged on talking much about abortion during his primary campaign,” Conant said. “It’s the one issue that he’s comfortable letting his opponents get to the right of him on.”

Democrats have made little secret that they plan to pin the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling on Trump in 2024 if he is the nominee.

“Let’s be clear: Donald Trump is responsible for ending Roe v. Wade. And if you vote for him, he’ll go even further,” President Joe Biden tweeted in September.

Reproductive rights advocates also noted the efforts underway to place ballot measures similar to the Ohio amendment in states like Arizona and Florida next year — which, they say, could help boost the fortunes of Democratic candidates running alongside the ballot measures.

Many vowed to continue to make Republicans pay for continuing to push for restrictions on abortion access.

“Even in states that are considered red, this is a winnable issue, across religious identities, political identities, because it impacts everybody’s lives in very fundamental ways, and we are going to continue to see this play out in elections to come — until we have access restored,” said Tamarra Wieder, the Kentucky state director of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, one of the political arms of the national reproductive rights group, before she delivered a warning directly to Republicans.

“You’ve lost on this issue,” she said. “And you better be prepared to continue to lose.”"

Nov 07 2023,Ohio voters approve amendment enshrining abortion access into state consitution,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/ohio-voters-approve-amendment-enshrining-abortion-access-state-consitution,"Ohio voters have approved a constitutional amendment, according to an Associated Press race call, enshrining abortion rights into the state's constitution in a vote that was opposed by Republicans in the state who argued the measure went even farther than Roe v. Wade.

The election signals a major victory for pro-abortion advocates, including the ACLU, who had pumped tens of millions into the state that Trump carried by 8 points in 2020 arguing that a constitutional amendment was needed to protect abortion access after the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.

Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights spokesperson Lauren Blauvelt said in an ACLU press release last month that the opponents of Issue 1 were the ""extremists"" who are ""trying to take away our rights and mislead voters.""

5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT OHIO'S CONTROVERSIAL CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON ABORTION BEFORE ELECTION DAY

""Voting NO hands your most personal family decisions over to the GOVERNMENT,"" Blauvelt said.

Top Republicans in the state, along with parental rights groups and faith leaders, argued that the measure went ""too far"" and in many cases even farther than Roe v. Wade did.

""It's pretty clear that this constitutional amendment just goes farther, much further than what the average Ohioan approves,"" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told Fox News Digital last month.

""If a voter is comfortable with abortion up until the time of birth, they're probably going to be okay with this amendment — if they're comfortable with parents not being involved in the most important decision their daughter will ever make or certainly has made up until that point in her life. If they're okay with that, then they should vote for this,"" DeWine added.

""The ACLU paid out-of-state signature collectors to lie to Ohioans about their dangerous amendment that will strip parents of their rights, permit minors to undergo sex change operations without their parents’ knowledge or consent, and allow painful abortion on demand through all nine months,"" PWO spokesperson Amy Natoce said.

Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said before the election that Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year’s presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Abortion-related initiatives could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

Nov 07 2023,"Ohio Issue 1, protecting abortion rights, leads in early returns",Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/07/ohio-issue-1-election-results,"COLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohioans voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution Tuesday, another sweeping repudiation of efforts to curb reproductive rights in a contest that was the most closely watched referendum in the country this year. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The decisive win in a Republican-controlled state that voted twice for Donald Trump is likely to boost Democrats’ hopes that protections will be established in other states during next year’s presidential election, as well as provide fuel for their candidates going forward.

Network exit polls suggest that the passage of the amendment was driven by strong turnout among Democratic-leaning groups and swing groups, with women emphatically favoring the measure while men backed it by a smaller margin. Black and Latino voters heavily endorsed the amendment, and White voters — the majority of the electorate — supported it more narrowly.

While most Democrats and independents supported the measure and most Republicans were opposed, about 1 in 5 GOP voters and Trump supporters backed it, the exit poll found. A clear majority of Ohio voters said they felt “dissatisfied” or “angry” about the landmark Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022, as opposed to feeling “satisfied” or “enthusiastic.”

Abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks of pregnancy in Ohio, but proponents pushed a massive signature drive to get an amendment on November’s ballot after a ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy went into effect last year, causing patients to flee to other states for treatment. The six-week ban was being litigated in court, but loomed large in the minds of many voters.

The amendment battle garnered intense national interest as a potential bellwether issue for the 2024 election, with millions of dollars from deep-pocketed billionaires and national special interest groups flowing into the state. Each side has spent about $20 million, election records show.

“Our message was that private medical decisions should be left for people to make with their families and politicians should not be a part of those decisions,” said Lauren Beene, executive director of Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights and a leader of Protect Choice Ohio, the grass-roots organization that spearheaded the drive to get the issue on the fall ballot.

Lauren Blauvelt, campaign co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement that “Ohioans rejected disinformation and fear and voted instead to ensure that every Ohioan has access to the reproductive health care they need here in our state.”

Aaron Baer, President of Ohio’s Center for Christian Virtue, which led the fight against the state amendment, vowed that “the fight will continue” despite the defeat on Tuesday.

“Our hearts are broken tonight, not because we lost, but because Ohio women and families will bear the brunt,” he said.

Ohio is the seventh state to protect abortion access since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision invalidated Roe v. Wade’s federal abortion standard. Before Ohio, voters in other red states such as Kansas and Kentucky were among those siding with abortion access.

The Ohio amendment, known on the ballot as Issue 1, makes it a constitutional right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” including on abortion, contraception, fertility treatment and miscarriage care. It allows the state to restrict abortion after fetal viability, except when “necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”

Opponents of Ohio’s measure had argued that the language in the amendment was too vague and “too extreme” for the state. They alleged that the amendment could hinder parents’ rights to oversee their children’s lives and that the definition of “health” could be misused by doctors to apply to nonmedical circumstances. Legal experts rejected both of those claims.

On Tuesday night, opponents of the amendment gathered in a vacant downtown Columbus office building to watch returns come in, snacking on appetizers and sodas. The evening began optimistically with prayer and cheer but the mood quickly soured, with many heading early for the exits.

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost (R) said in an interview that the passage of the amendment he opposed would prompt reflection and recalibration.

Asked where Ohio’s right-to-life movement goes after the defeat at the ballot box, Yost said, “It’s a great question. There is no blueprint; this is an existential fight.”

But the defeat is likely to prompt more soul searching from antiabortion movements, even as some abortion opponents are arguing that the movement coalesce around a push for a 15-week federal abortion ban. Others are arguing that they need to be more pragmatic about supporting exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother, and do a better job of explaining government programs backed by the GOP that support mothers and babies.

Republican Gov. Mike DeWine was an outspoken opponent of the measure, appearing in a recent ad with his wife, Fran, urging a “no” vote and warning that the proposal was “not right for Ohio.” His spokesman, Dan Tierney, said that the governor would not be making a statement after the vote Tuesday night.

On Tuesday, college students, retirees and workers from a sprawling military community at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base turned out to vote at a polling station on the Wright State University campus outside Dayton. The complexity of the issue was evident there, with voters for and against not necessarily breaking down along party lines.

Ethel Burns, 70, who is Black and a retired Air Force sergeant, said she voted for the amendment.

“The government does not need to be in my body,” Burns said, noting that Prohibition didn’t stop drinking and that she feels a ban on abortions wouldn’t stop abortions.

“This is an issue that is between a woman and her God,” Burns said.

Looking ahead to 2024, however, Burns said she was rethinking her support for President Biden after switching her allegiance to Biden and the Democrats in 2020 following her vote for Trump in 2016. She cited the Biden administration’s handling of the war in Gaza, which she believes is alienating Muslims and voters of color.

“I am disillusioned,” Burns said. “I grew up Democrat, but when I started serving in the military, Republicans were pro-military. Now that I’m a senior citizen, I just want somebody who will work for the good of the people.”

In recent weeks, DeWine had tried to appeal to centrist voters by suggesting that the Ohio legislature should revisit the wording of the state’s six-week ban if the abortion amendment failed, adding exceptions in cases of rape or incest. But there was no guarantee Ohio’s Republican supermajority in the state legislature would agree with him, critics said.

Robert Benge, 50, a construction worker in Beavercreek, near Dayton, said Tuesday he was voting against the amendment, citing a falsehood about its impact on transgender youths that has been spread by the opposition and debunked by Yost, the state’s conservative attorney general.

“Kids should not be allowed to have gender-reassignment surgery without their parents’ permission,” said Benge, a Republican.

In the spring, as abortion rights supporters gathered steam in their effort to collect signatures to put abortion protection on the fall ballot, the Republican supermajority in the state legislature voted to hold an August special election that would have made it harder to pass constitutional amendments, raising the threshold of passage from a simple majority to 60 percent.

The issue — aimed squarely at abortion supporters — was defeated by a decisive margin, with voters even in counties that supported Trump rejecting the proposal, a precursor to Tuesday’s result.

The GOP’s attempt at gamesmanship in August was noted by Democratic voters Tuesday.

“We need to get these Republican fools under control,” said Tim Powell, 71, a retired resident of Beavercreek. Powell said he voted for the abortion amendment because he wants to keep abortion legal and accessible in Ohio.

At the Wright State University polling location, voters ranged from those who said their Christian beliefs prevented them from supporting the procedure to others who said their support of a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions was unwavering.

Ron Sager, 79, a retired Air Force veteran, and his wife, Patricia Sager, 76, cast their votes against the amendment.

“We do not believe in abortion. We are Christians,” Ron Sager said. Patricia Sager said that abortion is a very complicated topic but that “we never agree with killing a baby.”

Kaylee Spencer, 21, of Fairborn, who works at a nearby movie theater, said she voted for the amendment.

“I would like to keep all of my rights and make sure everyone else has them too,” Spencer said. She said that she was less passionate about Issue 2, which would legalize recreational use of marijuana in Ohio, but that she also voted yes on that."
Nov 07 2023,Ohio Votes to Enshrine Abortion Rights Despite GOP's Dirty Tricks,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ohio-votes-protect-abortion-rights-1234872238,"Turns out, people want more control over their own medical decisions, not less.

That was the message an overwhelming majority of voters in Ohio sent their elected officials on Tuesday, voting to enshrine the right to an abortion in their state’s constitution — despite aggressive efforts to prevent them from doing so.

The amendment that will be added to Ohio’s constitution declares: “Every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on: contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.”

Tuesday’s election results ensure that abortion will remain widely accessible in Ohio for the foreseeable future, a stark reversal of fortunes for women in the state. Ohio’s ban on abortion — which briefly went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 — became the subject of nationwide attention when a 10-year-old rape victim was forced to travel to Indiana to obtain the procedure. (The ban is currently blocked while a legal challenge makes its way through the court system.)

The vote represents another resounding victory for reproductive rights — and one that is all the sweeter because of the extraordinary lengths state officials went to confuse, mislead, and prevent voters from considering the question in the first place.

Ohio Republicans decided earlier this year to hold a special election in August, a gambit intended to raise the threshold to amend the state constitution ahead of Tuesday’s vote on abortion protections. It was a surprising and cynical decision on their part, as only a few months earlier the same GOP lawmakers had banned August special elections, declaring them to be costly, low-turnout affairs. In the end the ploy backfired: huge numbers of voters turned out and emphatically rejected the Republican proposal.

And that special election wasn’t the only roadblock Republicans threw in the way of the proposed amendment. After the August walloping, the Ohio Ballot Board, chaired by Republican Secretary of State Frank La Rose re-wrote the summary of the question put to voters substituting the medical term “fetus” to “unborn child,” among other tweaks. There were fears ahead of the vote that the new language could affect whether it passed. According to one poll, the change in framing was enough to swing 16 percent of voters against the amendment. Editor’s picks

The Associated Press also reported that the Ohio Senate Majority Caucus communications department used taxpayer funds and a government website to spread misinformation about the ballot measure, warning of “abortion on demand” or “dismemberment of fully conscious children” if voters approved the measure.

In the end, voters saw through it. With this vote, Ohio becomes the latest in a string of Republican-controlled states where voters have indicated they want more protections for abortion, and fewer restrictions on the procedure. Last year, voters in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana rejected proposals to further restrict abortion last year, while voters in Michigan overturned their state’s abortion ban.

The victory should further energize pro-choice organizers in other red states. There are already efforts under way to put abortion referenda on the ballot in Arizona, South Dakota, Missouri, and Florida in 2024, and, perhaps with the win in Ohio, more are soon to follow."

The Texas Supreme Court has halted an order that would've allowed a Texas woman to have an abortion due to a fatal condition.

The Texas Supreme Court has halted an order that would've allowed a Texas woman to have an abortion due to a fatal condition.

The Texas Supreme Court has halted an order that would've allowed a Texas woman to have an abortion due to a fatal condition.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the state Supreme Court to intervene and stop a Dallas woman from having an abortion.

Paxton's office petitioned the high court just before midnight Thursday, after a Travis County district judge granted a temporary restraining order allowing Kate Cox, 31, to terminate her nonviable pregnancy. Paxton also sent a letter to three hospitals, threatening legal action if they allowed the abortion to be performed at their facility.

On Friday evening, the state Supreme Court temporarily halted the lower court's order but did not rule on the merits of the case. The court said it would rule on the temporary restraining order, but did not specify when.

""While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state's request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,"" said Cox's lawyer, Molly Duane, in a Friday evening statement.

This is the first time an actively pregnant adult woman has gone to court to get an abortion since before Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. A similar case was filed in Kentucky on Friday.

In the petition, Paxton asked the Texas Supreme Court to rule quickly, saying that ""each hour the temporary restraining order remains in place is an hour that Plaintiffs believe themselves free to perform and procure an elective abortion.""

""Nothing can restore the unborn child's life that will be lost as a result,"" the filing said. ""Post hoc enforcement is no substitute, so time is of the essence.""

The Texas Supreme Court is currently also considering a similar case, Zurawski v. Texas, in which 20 women claim they were denied medically necessary abortions for their complicated pregnancies due to the state's new laws. The state has argued those women do not have standing to sue because, unlike Cox, they are not currently seeking abortions.

In the initial lawsuit, Cox's attorneys with the Center for Reproductive Rights argued she cannot wait the weeks or months it might take the Texas Supreme Court to rule.

Now, the high court must consider many of the same arguments as those in Zurawski v. Texas, but on a much tighter timeline.

The central question is whether a lethal fetal anomaly qualifies a pregnant patient for an abortion under the narrow medical exception to the state's near-total abortion ban. Cox's lawyers argue that continuing this nonviable pregnancy poses a threat to her life and future fertility, thus necessitating an abortion.

Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble agreed, saying it would be a ""miscarriage of justice"" to force Cox to continue the pregnancy. The state disagreed, telling the Supreme Court that Guerra Gamble's ruling ""opens the floodgates to pregnant mothers procuring an abortion"" beyond the scope of the medical exception.

Separately, Duane sent a letter to Guerra Gamble, asking her to bring Paxton in for a hearing on his letter threatening legal action against hospitals that allow Cox to have an abortion.

""The repeated misrepresentations of the Court's order, coupled with explicit threats of criminal and civil enforcement and penalties, serve only to cow the hospitals from providing Ms. Cox with the healthcare that she desperately needs,"" Duane wrote. ""Plaintiffs respectfully request the Court hold a hearing so Defendant Paxton can explain to Your Honor why he should not be sanctioned.""

Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar, on behalf of President Joe Biden's re-election campaign, condemned Paxton's comments Friday.

""A Texas woman was just forced to beg for life-saving health care in court and now any doctor who provides her the care she urgently needs is being threatened with punishment including a lifetime prison sentence,"" Escobar said in a statement. ""This story is shocking, it's horrifying, and it's heartbreaking.""

Issue 1 would enshrine in the state constitution the right to an abortion up until viability, which is when a fetus can survive outside the uterus with reasonable measures. It also states that there's a right to access contraception, miscarriage care, fertility treatment and continuing a pregnancy.

Ohio is the only state with an abortion issue on the ballot this year. Many states are looking at Ohio ahead of the 2024 election when more states are expected to have abortion issues on the presidential ballot.

Issue 2 would allow Ohioans age 21 and older to possess 2.5 ounces of marijuana in any form except extract and 15 grams of extract. They could also grow up to six plants individually and no more than 12 in a household with multiple adults.

Products would be taxed 10% on top of Ohio's sales tax. The revenue would go toward a cannabis social equity and jobs program, municipalities with dispensaries, a state fund to combat substance abuse and administrative costs.

Nov 06 2023,‘All the nation’s eyes’ on Ohio as voters determine fate of abortion in state,WDTN 2,center,https://wdtn.com/as-seen-on-2-news/ohio-issue-1-contraceptive-rights,"DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) — On the eve of Ohioans going to the polls to determine whether reproductive rights will be enshrined in the state constitution, NBC News political correspondent Steve Kornacki spoke with 2 NEWS’ John Seibel about the implications of Issue 1.

Citing earlier failures of Kansas and Kentucky to change their constitutions to permanently ban abortion, Kornacki said there has been a recent history of even historically conservative states rejecting total bans.

“We have yet to see, since the Supreme Court decision more than a year ago, we’ve yet to see an initiative advanced by the pro-choice side that has failed,” said Kornacki. “And we’ve yet to see an initiative advanced by the pro-life side in the state pass.”

Kornacki cited the most recent polling that showed Yes leading No on Issue 1, 57-35.

“If this one were to fail in Ohio, it would be a surprise based on the polling,” he said.

One factor that may help the amendment to pass in the red Ohio, Kornacki believes, is that the measure, similar to one recently adopted in Michigan, also establishes a limit to the right of abortion to fetal viability. Other measures adopted in liberal Vermont and California didn’t have a limit."
Nov 16 2023,Missouri's abortion law faces challenge in court over claims of religious influence,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/missouris-abortion-law-faces-challenge-court-claims-of-religious-influence,"A St. Louis judge on Thursday will hear arguments in a lawsuit challenging Missouri's abortion ban on the grounds that lawmakers who passed the measure imposed their own religious beliefs on others who don't share them.

The lawsuit was filed in January on behalf of 13 Christian, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist leaders who support abortion rights. It seeks a permanent injunction barring the state from enforcing its abortion law, and a declaration that provisions of the law violate the Missouri Constitution.

It is among 38 lawsuits filed in 23 states challenging restrictive abortion laws enacted by conservative states after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The landmark ruling left abortion rights up to each state to decide.

MISSOURI SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE FATE OF ABORTION LEGALIZATION AMENDMENT AMID REPUBLICAN INFIGHTING

MISSOURI REPUBLICAN SEEKS EXCEPTIONS TO NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN, INCLUDING FOR RAPE AND INCEST CASES

The lawsuit states the Missouri Constitution ""does not tolerate this establishment into law of one particular religious view at the expense of others’ religious freedom and of the health and lives of millions of Missourians.""

Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, a Republican, has called the lawsuit ""foolish"" and said lawmakers ""were acting on the belief that life is precious and should be treated as such,"" not a religious belief.

Within minutes of last year’s Supreme Court decision, then-Attorney General Eric Schmitt and Gov. Mike Parson, both Republicans, filed paperwork to immediately enact a 2019 law prohibiting abortions ""except in cases of medical emergency."" That law contained a provision making it effective only if Roe v. Wade was overturned.

The law makes it a felony punishable by 5 to 15 years in prison to perform or induce an abortion. Medical professionals who do so also could lose their licenses. The law says that women who undergo abortions cannot be prosecuted.

Missouri already had some of the nation’s more restrictive abortion laws and had seen a significant decline in the number of abortions performed, with residents instead traveling to clinics just across the state line in Illinois and Kansas.

The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the faith leaders by Americans United for Separation of Church & State and the National Women’s Law Center, said sponsors and supporters of the Missouri measure ""repeatedly emphasized their religious intent in enacting the legislation.""

It quotes the bill’s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Nick Schroer, as saying that ""as a Catholic I do believe life begins at conception and that is built into our legislative findings."" A co-sponsor, Republican state Rep. Barry Hovis, said he was motivated ""from the Biblical side of it,"" according to the lawsuit.

Lawsuits in other states take similar approaches.

In Indiana, lawyers for five anonymous women — who are Jewish, Muslim and spiritual — and advocacy group Hoosier Jews for Choice argued that state’s ban infringes on their beliefs. Their lawsuit specifically highlights the Jewish teaching that a fetus becomes a living person at birth and that Jewish law prioritizes the mother’s life and health. A state appeals court is scheduled to hear arguments Dec. 6.

In Kentucky, three Jewish women sued, claiming the state’s ban violates their religious rights under the state’s constitution and religious freedom law. They allege that Kentucky’s Republican-dominated legislature ""imposed sectarian theology"" by prohibiting nearly all abortions."
Sep 22 2023,Mother Sentenced for Giving Abortion Pills to Daughter,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/abortion-pills-nebraska-abortion/2023/09/22/id/1135611,"A 42-year-old woman was sentenced to two years in prison Friday for acquiring abortion pills that her teenage daughter used to end a pregnancy, The New York Times reported.

Jessica Burgess, a resident of Norfolk, Nebraska, was charged by police after they discovered in Facebook messages that she schemed with her 17-year-old daughter to end the pregnancy last year and ""burn the evidence.""

She was initially charged with concealing a stillbirth. However, after obtaining a warrant for Meta, law enforcement officials found evidence of a medically induced abortion, leading to new charges.

According to prosecutors, Burgess ordered the pills online and gave them to her daughter during the third trimester of her pregnancy, later burying the evidence.

Burgess pleaded guilty in July to violating Nebraska's abortion law, providing a law enforcement officer with false information, and removing or concealing human skeletal remains.

Her daughter was sentenced months ago to 90 days in jail and two years of probation after pleading guilty to removing or concealing human skeletal remains. She was released on Sept. 11 and attended the recent trial.

The police investigation began in late April 2022, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and when abortion was banned in Nebraska after 20 weeks from conception.

Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a 12-week ban into law this May, including regulation of puberty blockers for minors and a ban on gender-altering surgeries for minors, which takes effect on Oct. 1."

Dec 08 2023,"Texas Woman Granted Permission By Judge To Have An Abortion, AG Warns Of Potential Charges Against Doctor",Black Enterprise,left,https://blackenterprise.com/texas-woman-granted-permission-judge-abortion,"News by Iman Milner Texas Woman Granted Permission By Judge To Have An Abortion, AG Warns Of Potential Charges Against Doctor The ruling only applies to Cox.









A Texas woman has been granted the right to have an abortion after suing the state over its ban of pregnancy terminations. The 31-year-old mother of two, identified as Kate Cox, received a fatal diagnosis for her fetus at 20 weeks and petitioned the court to approve the procedure, CNN reported.

Cox is reportedly the first woman to ask a judge for permission for an oportion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the historic Roe v Wade decision in 2022. The ruling only applies to Cox, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned the woman’s physician that criminal and civil penalties could follow the completed procedure.

The ban is lifted for 14 days and allows for the Dallas woman to face no charges for going through with the potentially life-saving abortion.

“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy or continue to put my body or my mental health through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”

Cox’s baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, The Associated Press reports. Democratic State District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble granted a restraining order of the state’s restriction to Cox. “The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Gamble said. “So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”

Cox, who has already had two deliveries by cesareans sections, would be at high-risk of “uterine rupture and hysterectomy” if she were to have an induced labor. Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, said they are considering “the fastest way to get her abortion care” but did not disclose the details of their next steps, citing safety concerns over the controversial decision.

Oct 24 2023,Georgia Supreme Court upholds ‘heartbeat’ law banning abortion,Catholic News Agency,right,https://catholicnewsagency.com/news/255796/georgia-supreme-court-upholds-heartbeat-law-banning-abortion-recognizes-personhood-for-unborn,"While Daniel said that Roe allowed courts to essentially create laws and policy, she said that “an entire mess of jurisprudence flowing from that was finally undone in the Dobbs decision.”

“For 50 years under Roe, we the people did not get a say in what policy was going to govern us,” she said.

Now, Daniel said, “the people of Georgia have spoken.”

“They supported the lawmakers who passed this law,” she explained. “This is the policy that Georgians prefer. So that should be the policy that governs.”

Besides banning abortion at six weeks, the LIFE Act also establishes that unborn babies are human persons in the eyes of the law, allows mothers to receive child support from the beginning of pregnancy, and allows parents to claim unborn babies as dependents on state income taxes.

The law says that “modern medical science, not available decades ago, demonstrates that unborn children are a class of living, distinct persons” and that it “shall be the policy of the state of Georgia to recognize unborn children as natural persons.”

By “natural person,” the LIFE Act explains that it means “any human being including an unborn child.”

The ruling is yet another pro-life victory in what Daniel said has been a “tremendous first year under Dobbs.”

While only one state had a heartbeat law before Dobbs, 25 states have now enacted policies to protect unborn babies from the point when they can feel pain or earlier, according to Daniel.

In August, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a similar heartbeat law protecting unborn babies at six weeks. In Florida, another heartbeat law is being considered by the state Supreme Court in a case that could end up reversing the Florida Constitution’s right to abortion established under Roe.

“There’s been an enormous amount of momentum in the last year, and we’re very optimistic,” Daniel said. “We know there will be hard fights, but there are also great opportunities.”

Nov 15 2023,Abortion rights advocates release petition language to get issue on Nov. ballot,KOLN,center,https://1011now.com/2023/11/15/abortion-rights-advocates-release-petition-language-get-issue-nov-ballot,"LINCOLN, Neb. (KOLN) - Despite the state legislature banning abortion after 12 weeks earlier this year, the fight for abortion rights is not over in Nebraska.

The group Protect Our Rights Nebraska will officially launch their campaign Thursday to get abortion access on the November 2024 ballot.

On Wednesday, the group released the approved petition language.

Object Statement The object of this petition is to amend the Nebraska Constitution to provide all persons the fundamental right to abortion without interference from the state or its political subdivisions until fetal viability, which is the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures; or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Policy Language Article I of the Nebraska Constitution shall be amended by adding a new section 31 as shown: All persons shall have a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions. Fetal viability means the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient’s treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus’ sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.

A constitutional amendment, which is what this petition is, requires 10 percent of registered voters to sign the petition.

Signatures must also be gathered from 5 percent of voters in 38 of 93 of Nebraska’s counties.

“Our constitutional amendment is informed both by medical experts and where most Nebraskans are on this issue,” said Ashlei Spivey, a member of Protect Our Rights’ executive committee. “Unlike the state officials working to totally ban abortion, we’re elevating the voices and lived experiences of Nebraskans who believe that pregnant people should be able to access needed care with compassion and privacy, free from political interference. This amendment will ensure that these personal decisions stay with Nebraskans — not politicians.”

State Senator Joni Albrecht who advocated for an abortion ban at 6 weeks gestation and later compromised with a 12 week ban during the last legislative session released this response: “This extreme proposal would allow late-term abortion throughout pregnancy, eliminate health and safety standards, and allow minors to obtain abortions without parental notification. Abortion is legal in the first trimester in Nebraska with clear exceptions for the life of the mother and medical emergencies throughout pregnancy. An amendment that jeopardizes the health and safety of women and abandons babies who deserve love and protection to painful late-term abortion procedures must be rejected.”

Gov. Jim Pillen was also critical of the ballot initiative. “This flawed initiative would radically expand abortion in Nebraska, resulting in the deaths of thousands of babies in mothers’ wombs. Its vague and deceptive language could throw open the doors to brutal late-term abortions, putting abortion providers in charge of judging whether, for example, a 39-week-old pre-born baby can be aborted, Pillen said. “That is totally out of step with the pro-life principles of the overwhelming majority of Nebraskans, whose representatives last session passed a strong and reasonable 12-week abortion ban with common sense exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother. I was proud to sign that bill into law and I will continue to fight to save as many babies’ lives as possible from abortion, including by working to defeat this initiative. We will continue to support moms and help them choose life and love. I look forward to standing shoulder to shoulder with pro-life leaders across Nebraska to defend life in our state.”

Aug 08 2023,Anti-abortion group asks Wyoming Supreme Court to let them join abortion lawsuit,Casper Star-Tribune,center,https://trib.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/anti-abortion-group-asks-wyoming-supreme-court-to-reconsider-request-for-intervention/article_17197486-3604-11ee-8476-f70b93aefd77.html,"A group of anti-abortion lawmakers and advocates is asking the Wyoming Supreme Court to reconsider a judge’s decision that blocked them from joining a lawsuit challenging two abortion bans.

Reps. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams and Chip Neiman, as well as the anti-abortion group Right to Life Wyoming, filed the appeal Friday afternoon. Rodriguez-Williams, R-Cody, sponsored the Life is a Human Right Act — a sweeping abortion ban that supporters hoped would bring a quick end to abortions in Wyoming.

The group attempted to intervene in a lawsuit that seeks to strike down the Life is a Human Right Act as well as another law that would have banned medication abortions.

But Teton County Judge Melissa Owens denied their request last month. She argued that the proposed intervenors don’t have a “legally protectable interest” in joining the lawsuit and that their interests are already adequately represented by the state defendants. What’s more, she said in court filings that their involvement in the lawsuit would “unduly delay and prejudice” the litigation.

Owens also temporarily halted enforcement of the two abortion bans while the lawsuit ensues. For now, abortions until viability are still legal in Wyoming.

Secretary of State Chuck Gray had also been a part of the group attempting to join the lawsuit — a move that political observers said was unusual. He wasn’t, however, included in the recent appeal. Gov. Mark Gordon and State Attorney General Bridget Hill, who are defending the two abortion bans in the case, had opposed the state secretary’s involvement."
Dec 07 2023,IN-DEPTH: Texas Judge Grants Court-Authorized Abortion in Landmark Case Despite State Restrictions,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/in-depth-texas-judge-grants-court-authorized-abortion-in-landmark-case-despite-state-restrictions-5543236,"Case is among the first attempts to get a court-authorized abortion after the Roe v. Wade ruling, which gave states the right to impose their own abortion laws.

A Texas judge has granted a pregnant woman’s request for a court-authorized abortion after her unborn child was diagnosed with multiple abnormalities and given no hope of survival after birth, with the decision coming despite strict prohibitions on the procedure in the state for any reason other than if the mother’s life is in danger.

A judge at the District Court of Travis County, Texas, granted a temporary restraining order on Dec. 7 to Kate Cox, a woman who is 20 weeks pregnant and filed an emergency lawsuit against the state of Texas.

Ms. Cox was seeking the right to abort her baby after doctors diagnosed it with Trisomy 18—a condition that causes multiple structural abnormalities—and gave it no chance of survival after birth.

Several doctors also told Ms. Cox that continuing to carry the pregnancy to term could threaten her health and future fertility, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit on her behalf on Dec. 5, asking the judge to impose a temporary restraining order—and a permanent injunction—against Texas’ strict abortion laws.

Texas’ abortion laws prohibit and criminalize abortions in all cases except when the mother’s life is in danger under a “medical emergency” exception.

Lawyers for the State of Texas argued in court that Ms. Cox’s symptoms did not meet the standard set out for a “medical emergency” and that her doctors made a “subjective” determination that she qualified for an abortion rather than basing their medical opinion on “objective” standards set out in law. The Decision In her complaint, Ms. Cox’s attorneys argued that the state’s abortion laws were causing “irreparable injury” to her and the other two plaintiffs—her husband and her doctor.

Because Ms. Cox had two prior cesarean surgeries (C-sections), continuing the pregnancy put her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including hysterectomy and uterine rupture, her lawyers said. They argued that an abortion was the safest option for Ms. Cox’s health and her “best medical option given that she wants to have more children in the future.”

“Yet because of Texas’ abortion bans, Ms. Cox’s physicians have informed her that their ‘hands are tied’ and she will have to wait until her baby dies inside her or carry the pregnancy to term, at which point she will be forced to have a third C-section, only to watch her baby suffer until death,” they wrote, adding that Ms. Cox “needs an abortion, and she needs it now.”

During an emergency hearing on Thursday, the judge, Maya Guerra Gamble, agreed and granted Ms. Cox the temporary restraining order that allows her to get the abortion in Texas.

“The idea that Ms. Cox wants so desperately to be a parent and this law may have her lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,“ Judge Gamble said from the bench. ”So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”

The judge also scheduled a Dec. 20, 2024, date for a hearing on Ms. Cox’s request for a permanent injunction against Texas’ abortion laws.

The case is significant as it’s among the first attempts in the country to get a court-authorized abortion after the Roe v. Wade ruling, which gave states the right to impose their own abortion laws. The Reactions In a statement following the ruling, Ms. Cox said she needs to “end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health and a future pregnancy,” adding that she does not want her baby “to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”

Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, a senior fellow at The Catholic Association and host of the radio show Conversations With Consequences, addressed the circumstances of the case in a video post on X , arguing that there are alternatives to abortion for babies diagnosed with Trisomy 18.

“There is such a thing as perinatal hospice, and that is where babies who are destined to die quickly, like babies with Trisomy 18, it’s true that the baby—that’s not compatible with life,” Dr. Christie said.

“Those babies are received by their mothers, by their fathers, by their family, in places of dignity and tenderness, and then they are loved and held and honored until that beautiful life passes through natural means.”

The judge’s decision to grant a temporary restraining order against the enforcement of Texas’ abortion laws only applies to Ms. Cox’s case, with her request for a permanent injunction pending further court proceedings.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton responded to the temporary restraining order, saying that it will not insulate hospitals, doctors, or anyone else from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws.

Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing a group of women in a separate abortion-related lawsuit against Texas, called the state’s restrictions on abortions “dangerous.”

The other lawsuit, with the involvement of the Center for Reproductive Rights, claims that Texas’ abortion laws are too restrictive and harm women because doctors who are fearful of losing their licenses refuse to perform the procedure in nearly all circumstances. ‘Medical Emergency’ Exception In Focus Pro-abortion rights groups have argued that Texas’ abortion bans contain non-medical terminology and conflicting language that make it unclear when doctors are allowed to perform abortions under the laws’ “medical emergency” exception, stoking fear and confusion among doctors.

Physicians who violate the state’s abortion laws face revocation of their state medical licenses, fines of at least $100,000, and up to 99 years in prison, with pro-abortion rights groups arguing that the legal risks combined with the laws’ unclear language deter doctors from performing abortions even in cases where the mother’s life is in danger.

A group of five Texas women who say they were denied abortions despite facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications that threatened their health and lives, sued the state of Texas in March over the abortion laws.

The women, who are being represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, were joined in the lawsuit by two Texas obstetrician-gynecologists, while an amended complaint filed in May added more plaintiffs to the case and asked a state court to grant a temporary injunction to block the abortion bans while the case proceeds.

The state of Texas called to dismiss the case, arguing that the laws were clear enough about what constitutes a “medical emergency” exception. State attorneys previously said that the lawsuit was brought because the 13 women were not satisfied with the medical care they received. The state argued that what happened to the women was the responsibility of their doctors, not Texas abortion laws.

“The plaintiffs simply do not like Texas’ restrictions on abortion. This court well knows the purpose of this court is not to legislate or to issue advisory opinions. In fact, the Texas Supreme Court has upheld that courts are prohibited from doing so,” Assistant Texas Attorney General Amy Pletscher told the judge in July.

Then, in August, a Texas district judge issued an injunction temporarily blocking the state’s abortion bans and allowing doctors to perform the procedure on women who have what she called “emergent medical conditions.”

Travis County District Court Judge Jessica Mangrum defined “emergent medical conditions” as physical complications or infections that make pregnancy unsafe, exacerbated medical conditions that cannot be treated during pregnancy, and fetal conditions where survival is unlikely after birth.

She also ruled that any state official who seeks to enforce Texas’s abortion bans against a doctor who provides the procedure after the doctor had determined that the pregnant mother has a “physical emergent medical condition” would be exceeding their legal authority.

The state of Texas immediately appealed the ruling to the Texas Supreme Court, blocking the injunction from taking effect.

The Center for Reproductive Rights then filed an amended complaint on Nov. 14, adding seven more Texas women as plaintiffs.

The first oral arguments in the case were heard by the Texas Supreme Court on Nov. 28.

Key Arguments Attorneys on behalf of the state of Texas argued that the “medical emergency” exception is clear and that the plaintiffs’ battle should take place not before the court but at the state legislature to get the laws changed.

State attorney Beth Klusmann argued that the plaintiffs want the high court to effectively overturn the will of Texans as expressed through the legislative process and make it “so that there really will never be a circumstance in which a woman is unable to obtain an abortion.”

Ms. Klusmann argued that the law allows physicians to use their professional judgment to decide when the law allows for an abortion.

Arguing on behalf of the plaintiffs, Attorney Molly Duane called the last two years an “aberration” from a long practice in Texas that allowed physicians “broad discretion” to provide abortions when they deemed it “necessary” to preserve the lives of their patients.

Ms. Duane argued that, even though the law technically has medical exceptions to the bans, “no one knows what it means, and the State won’t tell us.”

Asked by a judge on the high bench why the plaintiffs weren’t seeking a declaration of the abortion laws’ unconstitutionality based on the “vagueness” doctrine, Ms. Duane replied that this would have meant that the entire law could be struck down, which is not the wish or intent of the plaintiffs.

Instead, she said they’re seeking additional “clarification” about what the “medical emergency” exception really means.

Ms. Duane also said that the women don’t want to sue the doctors because they don’t see them as having done anything wrong except following a law that is too vague and overly restrictive.

In closing arguments, Ms. Klusmann contended that the case is really about medical malpractice in specific instances where the plaintiffs—women who said they were denied abortions despite facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications that threatened their health and lives—may have been given inadequate medical treatment by physicians.

Following closing arguments, the court adjourned the case, which is known as Zurawski v. State of Texas."
Oct 23 2023,"Beshear, Cameron clash over COVID, abortion at KET debate",WKYT,center,https://wkyt.com/2023/10/24/beshear-cameron-clash-over-covid-abortion-ket-debate,"LEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - We are just two weeks away from the highly anticipated Kentucky governor’s race.

On Monday night, candidates Governor Andy Beshear and Attorney General Daniel Cameron went head-to-head in the KET Debate in lexington.

They discussed various issues impacting the Commonwealth.

A back-and-forth on COVID-19 and the handling of the pandemic turned into a lengthy discussion on education and each candidate’s plan to fill the gaps in this area.

As Cameron has said in previous debates, he claims there is a significant learning loss across the state due to Beshear’s decision to halt in-person learning during the pandemic.

Beshear once again stood by this decision, saying Cameron would have sent teachers and students with health issues potentially to their deaths if he had sent them back to school before vaccines.

This discussion led to both candidates saying what they would do to address the issue of learning loss.

Beshear says the problem, even before the pandemic, has been a reach shortage, something that is much worse now.

He says his plan proposes significant pay raises for school staff across the board.

Cameron says he has a plan called the Cameron catch-up plan, which he describes as a 16-week program that includes both after-school and summer instruction taught by paid teachers and student teachers.

Cameron was once again asked if he personally favors allowing legal abortions in Kentucky in cases of rape or incest.

It’s a question Cameron has appeared to repeatedly shift his stance on as far as what exceptions he would support adding to the abortion ban.

Cameron’s answer to the yes/no question was to say he is Planned Parenthood’s worst nightmare.

This led to another heated exchange between Cameron and Beshear.

Beshear says he believes there have to be exceptions for rape and incest.

When asked, Cameron did say that he does not want to criminalize a woman who does get an out-of-state abortion.

Even though he was one of nineteen Republicans who signed a letter opposing proposed federal privacy rules that would block state officials from getting medical records of women who seek abortions out of state.

You will have a final chance to see the candidates this Tuesday on WKYT. Governor Andy Beshear and Daniel Cameron have both accepted invitations to The Kentucky Debate, which will air from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. on WKYT.

Sep 19 2023,Indiana AG to Newsmax: Suing Not About Abortion,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/todd-rokita-indiana-attorney-general-abortion/2023/09/19/id/1135113,"Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita told Newsmax on Tuesday he is not targeting the doctor who spoke out about performing an abortion for a 10-year-old Ohio girl who was raped last summer in his lawsuit against the state’s largest healthcare system.

The lawsuit, filed Friday, claims Indiana University Health improperly prioritized its physician, Caitlin Bernard, instead of the patient’s right to confidentiality. Bernard talked to media outlets about performing the procedure shortly after the Supreme Court’s ruling in June 2022 ended the federal right to an abortion.

Bernard never mentioned the patient’s name — it turns out the girl was just over six weeks pregnant and ineligible for an abortion in Ohio. Gerson Fuentes, 28, who confessed to raping and impregnating the girl, was sentenced to life in prison in July.

“[The lawsuit] is not targeting Bernard, but her employer for doing things like not reporting the disclosure of information, not getting the consent of the little girl’s parent to go to the media,” Rokita told “American Agenda.” “Not properly training its workforce, for inconsistently treating members of its workforce. We found [many] employees of IU health have been fired for HIPAA violations that were much, much less egregious than going to MSNBC and the Indianapolis Star with the patient's chart and story.

“[Those] inconsistencies are a real problem and what I want to do, and that 36,000-member workforce, is to make sure that people aren't confused because if you don't have that trust between the patient and doctor, you don't have modern medicine.”

Rokita is facing a complaint filed Monday by the Indiana Supreme Court’s disciplinary commission regarding statements he made about Bernard.

“We're in an environment where anyone could lodge allegations, and we're in an environment where people attempt to weaponize our institutions all the time now,” Rokita said. “So, this is par for the course. We've answered the complaint already within record time, and we've made our case clear. I was elected by the people of Indiana. I have a duty to them.

“The things that I said about these cases earlier were about an international case that was evolving by the hour, and we did our best to balance everyone's interest. The fact of the matter is, we followed where the investigation took us, and we started and ended the investigation at the appropriate time. At the end of the day, the medical licensing board found Dr. Bernard liable for the things that she was saying to the world because it involved her patient. And that’s the point here.”

Dec 12 2023,"Wyoming high court ponders whether anti-abortion lawmakers, group can assist in bans’ defense - WyoFile",WyoFile,right,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-high-court-ponders-whether-anti-abortion-lawmakers-group-can-assist-in-bans-defense,"The Wyoming Supreme Court peppered lawyers with questions Tuesday as they mulled whether anti-abortion lawmakers and Right to Life Wyoming should be able to join the suit challenging the state’s two abortion bans.

The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office is defending the abortion bans, which lawmakers passed early this year, from a group of plaintiffs who say the laws violate the state constitution. Nevertheless, Reps. Chip Neiman (R-Hulett), Rachel Rodriguez-Williams (R-Cody) and Right to Life Wyoming asked the 9th District Court in Teton County to allow them to intervene in the consequential case, but were denied back in June.

Tuesday’s appeal hearing before the high court mirrored the trio’s original request: that the three have protectable interests — their years of anti-abortion work — and that the state wasn’t presenting enough evidence to counter plaintiffs in the case. They’re represented, in part, by the conservative Christian advocacy group Alliance Defending Freedom.

Arguing for the three parties, attorney Tim Garrison noted that the high court had already denied taking up a case involving Wyoming’s 2022 “trigger” abortion ban last December based on the “limited factual record provided.” Potential intervenors could add to that record to avoid similar court denials in the future, he said.

Justice Keith Kautz suggested Garrison was “reading into” the court’s denial more than he should, and that the justices never said there needed to be an evidentiary trial.

Justice Lynne Boomgaarden also questioned whether it may be too soon for the proposed intervenors to argue this case because the district court hasn’t decided whether the matter will go to trial.

Both the plaintiffs and the state are asking the district court in Teton County to skip a trial and issue a judgment on their behalf because they believe there are no factual issues in dispute, only legal ones. District Judge Melissa Owens is set to hear from both sides at a hearing Thursday in Jackson.

Boomgaarden added that, from what she heard in the potential intervenors’ argument, if plaintiffs get to present facts and evidence, they should, too. “And I don’t see where that’s part of the test for intervention.”

Special Assistant Attorney General Jay Jerde, defending the abortion bans on the state’s behalf, doesn’t oppose intervention, but stated in court that he believes his team is already vigorously defending the bans, relying on legislative facts it believes are most suitable to the case.

Peter Modlin, attorney for the plaintiffs in the case, argued that there’s no compelling case law to show that the proposed intervenors have a significant compelling interest in the case. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed lawmakers in Berger v. North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP, Modlin noted, but they were legislative leadership.

Beyond that, Modlin argued that a difference of opinion on how to argue the case isn’t enough to warrant intervention, especially when that intervention could “wind the clock backwards and restart this case from the beginning.”

Still, Boomgaarden asked whether it was a bit “too convenient” for the plaintiffs to be arguing against the proposed intervenors bringing evidence to the case when plaintiffs have presented evidence of their own.

Just last week, Owens decided to allow the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses in the case. She also accepted an amicus brief from a group of current and former doctors — and one former lawmaker — who outlined why they support the abortion bans.

The three proposed intervenors have not filed an amicus brief, arguing solely to be full parties to the case.

History

This group of three first tried to intervene last year in a suit challenging Wyoming’s first abortion ban. That involved the state’s “trigger ban,” which was set to go into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which also happened last year.

But the same day the ban was set to begin, Owens granted a temporary restraining order — stalling its enforcement — followed later by a preliminary injunction.

The anti-abortion lawmakers and Right to Life Wyoming attempted to intervene in that case, but Owens denied their request, writing: “The court is sympathetic to the [legislators and Right to Life’s] desire to intervene in this matter … However, the [legislators’ and RTLW’s] interests do not rise to the level of a significant protectable interest under the law.”

They appealed Owens’ decision to the state Supreme Court, but that case became moot after the Wyoming Legislature passed two new bans, one of which replaced the trigger ban and the other of which targeted medications used to induce abortions.

Earlier this year, Owens stalled enforcement of both of the new bans as part of the current court case.

In April, Secretary of State Chuck Gray joined the original group of three in requesting to join the latest abortion ban case. Owens again denied the proposed intervenors for much of the same reasons as before.

The group, sans Gray, then appealed to the Supreme Court once again.

What happens next?

Wyoming Supreme Court justices will deliberate and rule on this case at a later date.

Meanwhile, the 9th District Court has scheduled a hearing Thursday where the plaintiffs challenging Wyoming’s abortion bans and the state will present their cases for why the judge should skip a trial and rule on their behalf.

Regardless of the outcome of that case, it’s expected to be appealed to the Wyoming Supreme Court. For the time being, most abortion remains legal in Wyoming."

Abortion advocates in Michigan had a major setback this week. Voters enshrined abortion rights in the constitution last November, but figuring out what those rights mean has become a battle.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:

Democrats in Michigan were on the brink of repealing abortion restrictions in the state this week. But after a midnight voting marathon in the state House and one Democratic lawmaker hold out, abortion rights advocates only had a watered-down version of what they wanted. Michigan Radio's Kate Wells explains.

KATE WELLS, BYLINE: If any state seemed perfectly poised to expand abortion rights, it was Michigan. Voters here overwhelmingly passed proposal three last November, enshrining the right to an abortion in the state constitution. Plus, Democrats have control of the state House, the Senate, the governorship for the first time in decades. And Democrats wanted to use this power to remove the abortion restrictions the state still had on the books. Here's Democratic State Representative Laurie Pohutsky.

LAURIE POHUTSKY: So while we have this constitutional right under prop three to reproductive freedom, including abortion, these laws limit access, which makes it very difficult to call it truly a right when it's inaccessible to a number of people across the state.

WELLS: Now, Democrats did manage to repeal some of those abortion restrictions this week. They passed bills allowing private health insurance to cover abortion, and they removed regulatory restrictions on abortion clinics.

POHUTSKY: That being said, all of that is frankly irrelevant for somebody who still can't access abortion care because of that 24-hour delay.

WELLS: Pohutsky is talking about Michigan's mandatory 24-hour waiting period. Here's how it works. If you want to get an abortion in Michigan, you need to first go online to a state website. You need to review information there about parenting and fetal development, and then sign a time-stamped form, which must be generated no less than 24 hours but no more than two weeks before your appointment begins. And if you don't bring that signed, printed form with the right time stamp to your appointment, your appointment can't proceed. Dr. Halley Crissman is an OB-GYN in Ann Arbor, and she says patients get turned away almost every day because they messed up the form, or they just don't have it.

HALLEY CRISSMAN: And so an example from just this week of a patient who presented to clinic the first time from out of state, did not know about the 24-hour consent, did not bring the 24-hour consent with them.

WELLS: That patient ended up having to be rescheduled two more times before they were able to actually get the form, sign it and bring it with them to their appointment. But one Democrat did not want to remove the 24-hour waiting period - State Representative Karen Whitsett of Detroit.

KAREN WHITSETT: I still do not think that 24 hours of a pause to make sure you're making the right decision is too much to ask.

WELLS: Now, Whitsett also opposed a bill to allow Medicaid to cover abortions, and Democrats' majority in the Michigan House is so slim that this one no vote was enough to torpedo those efforts. For Dr. Crissman, the OB-GYN, this is frustrating. She says, with the 24-hour waiting period and the lack of Medicaid coverage it feels like lawmakers are saying...

CRISSMAN: You are a lower-income person or someone on Medicaid working to make ends meet, then your health care doesn't matter.

WELLS: Abortion advocates say they still believe the remaining restrictions on abortion are unconstitutional in Michigan, and they say they plan to find other ways to fight them. For NPR news, I'm Kate Wells in Ann Arbor.

MADISON, Wis. (CBS 58) -- A Republican district attorney said he will abide by a judge's ruling and not enforce the state's 1849 abortion ban pending an appeal, a decision the GOP leader of the state Senate wants him to ignore.

Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski said he plans to appeal Dane County Judge Diane Schlipper ruling that makes abortions legal again in Wisconsin.

On Tuesday, Schlipper reaffirmed her ruling from July that the state's 1849 abortion ban applies to feticide, not consensual medical abortions.

""I am obligated to comply with that ruling unless the decision is stayed pending appeal or ultimately reversed,"" Urmanski said in a statement.

Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), whose district represents Sheboygan County, suggested he wants Urmanski to defy Schlipper's ruling and enforce the ban when asked about the lawsuit.

""It's a law. Yes,"" LeMahieu said during an interview with CBS 58. ""I'm not sure how these judges dream up ways of striking down law even if they are 150 years old, but it's the law on the books.""

Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu wants the Sheboygan County DA Joel Urmanski to enforce the state's 1849 abortion ban after he said today, he wouldn't.



It comes in wake of judge's ruling that makes abortions legal again in WI. It's a decision Urmanski will appeal. pic.twitter.com/RKGx84eLkw — Emilee Fannon (@Emilee_Fannon) December 6, 2023

Urmanski is one of three district attorneys named as defendants in the lawsuit filed by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul in wake of the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, the court's landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion.

That triggered a debate as to whether the state's 1849 law, banning nearly all abortions unless a mother's life is at risk, was enforceable.

Kaul has long argued the statue is too old to enforce and praised the latest court ruling that is anticipated to head to the liberal controlled state Supreme Court.

""This is a momentous victory, but we also recognize this is not the end of the road,"" Kaul said. ""We are prepared to protect that freedom as we move forward.""

Urmanski was the only prosecutor in the state who pledged to prosecute abortion providers if there's an alleged violation in the days following the U.S. Supreme Court decision.

District attorneys in Dane and Milwaukee County vowed to not press charges against abortion providers and are also involved in the ongoing litigation.

Those counties, including Sheboygan, are home to Planned Parenthood clinics that offer abortion services.

After Schlipper's ruling, Planned Parenthood announced they will resume services at the Sheboygan clinic ""as soon as possible."" They restarted services at the Madison and Milwaukee clinics in September."

Dec 06 2023,Pregnant Texas woman challenges state abortion ban with lawsuit after receiving fetal fatal diagnosis,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/pregnant-texas-woman-challenges-state-abortion-ban-lawsuit-receiving-fetal-fatal-diagnosis,"A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis is seeking a court's permission for an abortion through a lawsuit.

This is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind in the U.S. since the overturn of Roe v. Wade last year.

The lawsuit comes a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard arguments on the ban's restrictiveness for women with pregnancy complications.

A pregnant Texas woman whose fetus has a fatal diagnosis asked a court Tuesday to let her have an abortion, bringing what her attorneys say is the first lawsuit of its kind in the U.S. since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.

Texas is one of 13 states that ban abortion at nearly all stages of pregnancy. Although Texas allows exceptions, doctors and women have argued in court this year that the state's law is so restrictive and vaguely worded that physicians are fearful of providing abortions lest they face potential criminal charges.

TEXAS JUDGE RULES STATE'S ABORTION LAW IS TOO RESTRICTIVE FOR WOMEN WITH PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS

Kate Cox, 31, is 20 weeks pregnant and has been told by doctors that her baby is likely to be stillborn or live for a week at most, according to the lawsuit filed in Austin. The suit says doctors told her their ""hands are tied"" under Texas' abortion ban.

""Kate Cox needs an abortion, and she needs it now,"" the lawsuit reads.

TEXAS ABORTION BAN CHALLENGED AS ORAL ARGUMENTS BEGIN

Spokespersons for the Texas attorney general's office, which has defended the ban in court, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

Molly Duane, Cox's lawyer and an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Tuesday that a court has not yet scheduled a hearing but one could happen later this week.

The lawsuit was filed a week after the Texas Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the ban is too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications. That case is among the biggest ongoing challenges to abortion bans in the U.S., although a ruling from the all-Republican court may not come for months.

Cox, a mother of two, had cesarean sections with her previous pregnancies. She learned she was pregnant for a third time in August and was told weeks later that her baby was at a high risk for a condition known as trisomy 18, which has a very high likelihood of miscarriage or stillbirth and low survival rates, according to the lawsuit.

Doctors told Cox that if the baby's heartbeat were to stop, inducing labor would carry a risk of a uterine rupture because of her prior cesareans, and that another C-section at full term would would endanger her ability to carry another child.

5 WOMEN SUE TEXAS OVER ABORTION BAN, SAYING IT RISKED THEIR LIVES

""It is not a matter of if I will have to say goodbye to my baby, but when. I’m trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer,"" Cox said in a statement.

In July, several Texas women gave emotional testimony about carrying babies they knew would not survive and doctors unable to offer abortions despite their spiraling conditions. A judge later ruled that Texas’ ban was too restrictive for women with pregnancy complications, but that decision was swiftly put on hold after the state appealed.

Duane said Cox reached out last week after coming across news stories following the hearing at the state Supreme Court. The arguments were held on the same day that Cox received results of an amniocentesis that confirmed prior tests about her pregnancy.

""How many people are going through the exact same thing as Kate is right now but are not in a position to file a lawsuit?"" Duane said in an interview. ""I think that gives you a sense of the scale of the problem that we're dealing with."""

Sep 18 2023,"Abortion services are back in Wisconsin, but only for some",Wisconsin Examiner,left,https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2023/09/18/abortion-services-are-back-in-wisconsin-but-only-for-some,"Abortion services are resuming in Madison and Milwaukee today after a 15-month pause. The suspension of services resulted from the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision that called into question the enforceability of an archaic law from 1849 threatening to put doctors in jail for performing nearly all abortions in the state. The chilling effect of this ban, on doctors and our patients, cannot be overstated.

When Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper ruled in July that the law applies to feticide and not consensual abortion, saying “there is no such thing as an 1849 abortion ban in Wisconsin,” the question was immediately raised: If this is the case, when would women be able to access abortion services in Wisconsin again? After weeks of planning to ensure optimal staffing and services, that day has come … for some.

For people who live in the other 97% of Wisconsin counties, however, nothing has changed.

Even prior to the fall of Roe, the only other city offering routine abortion care was Sheboygan, which meant that the entire northern, central, and western parts of our state lacked fundamental reproductive health care. Worse yet, politically enacted barriers — a 24-hour waiting period, absence of funding and insurance coverage, arbitrary gestational limits, and medically inaccurate mandatory counseling — make it nearly impossible for some women to access the care that they desperately need.

I will never forget the couple I met in Sheboygan who were seeking a medication abortion. They drove for three hours to see me for their mandatory counseling visit. After a fruitful discussion, they asked me to leave the room so they could talk through some things. When I returned, they were still trying to figure out what they could sell in order to come up with the gas money for their follow-up visit a few days later — all so that I, the same physician (per state law), could hand them a pill. That’s the same pill they can now just order over the internet without any interaction with or support from the medical system.

As a physician who cares deeply for my patients and their families, I can’t help but feel that political interference in our most personal health care decisions has forced me to abandon my patients when they need me the most. That’s why I chose to be involved as an intervenor in the ongoing legal case about the 1849 law. I needed to know that I was doing something to fix this malignant effort to control women.

Women understand this. Remember, one in four women in this country will have an abortion in her lifetime. Odds are you know many people who have had abortions, for a myriad of different reasons, but you probably don’t know their personal stories. I do.

Those women, and the people who care about them — their children, husbands, neighbors, and friends — are the people who give me hope. They may not be telling you their stories, but they are telling each other. They are recognizing this moment and galvanizing this movement. They understand that this issue is intimately tied to all of the upstream factors that affect our health: affordable child care, clean water, public education and so much more. They live in the suburban Milwaukee WOW counties as well as Rhinelander, Lancaster, and all across Wisconsin.

And they vote."
Nov 02 2023,A mom and son are charged in Idaho after a teen is taken to Oregon for an abortion,NPR Fact Check,left,https://npr.org/2023/11/02/1210198143/idaho-abortion-kidnapping-charges-oregon-underage-girlfriend-parental-rights,"A mom and son are charged in Idaho after a teen is taken to Oregon for an abortion

An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son's minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion.

Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl's mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion.

With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year.

Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents' consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don't have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren't relying on it.

According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend's house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho.

The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant.

According to court documents, the girl said she was ""happy"" when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship.

The boyfriend's mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to ""kick her out of their house"" if she did.

The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl's cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time.

The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was ""mutually agreed upon"" between the girl and her son. She said she she never ""coerced"" anyone into having an abortion.

Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl.

The mother is also facing multiple drug charges.

Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to ""keep or conceal"" the girl from her parents by transporting ""the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.""

Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment."

Police say the teenage girl’s mother told them her daughter had been sexually assaulted and taken to Oregon for an abortion earlier this year. The girl’s mother had not been told about the pregnancy. The girl said the relationship was consensual and she was happy about the pregnancy, according to court documents. She said her boyfriend and his mother threatened to kick her out of their house if she told her parents about the pregnancy. The mother insisted that the abortion was a mutual decision by her son and the girl, according to court documents. The mother is also facing drug charges, while the son received additional charges of rape and creating sexually explicit material of a minor.



Are the pair charged under the state’s abortion tourism law? The mother and son were charged without Idaho’s recently enacted abortion trafficking law, which makes it illegal to help a minor receive an abortion across state lines without her parents’ consent. The law is being challenged in court.

Jul 25 2023,Ohio Will Vote on Abortion Rights,New York Times (News),left,https://nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/ohio-abortion-rights-amendment.html,"Ohio voters will decide in November whether to amend their state Constitution to establish a right to abortion, after state officials said on Tuesday that proponents had submitted over 495,000 valid signatures from voters, more than enough to put the question on the ballot.

Supporters of the measure still face another hurdle. Republicans in the state legislature want to make the amendment harder to approve, and have put up a ballot question of their own that would raise the threshold of voters required to amend the state constitution to 60 percent instead of a simple majority. That question is on the ballot in a special election on Aug. 8; early voting on that amendment is already in progress.

In a statement Tuesday, Lauren Blauvelt and Lauren Beene of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the coalition behind the ballot measure, hailed the announcement.

“Every person deserves respect, dignity, and the right to make reproductive health care decisions, including those related to their own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion free from government interference,” they said in the statement. “Now that the petition drive is complete, we’re eager to continue the campaign to enshrine those rights in Ohio’s Constitution and ensure that Ohioans will never again be subject to draconian reproductive health care policies imposed by extremists.” Anti-abortion groups portray the amendment as “extreme,” and have argued that it would permit abortion “until birth” and also enshrine a right for minors to undergo gender-transition surgery without their parents’ consent, even though the amendment allows the state to prohibit abortion later in pregnancy and does not include any language about gender transition."

""The Court declares Wis. Stat. § 940.04 does not prohibit abortions,"" wrote Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper.

Schlipper ruled that the law in question, a statute written in 1849, does not apply to abortions but to feticide.

A consensual abortion is sought out by a pregnant woman who voluntarily determines to end a pregnancy. Schlipper's ruling is based on a 1994 state Supreme Court decision that determined feticide is a nonconsensual act in which somebody batters a woman to the point she loses the pregnancy.

With the 1849 statute no longer in effect, Wisconsin returns to its pre-Dobbs abortion laws, under which abortion is banned 20 weeks after ""probable fertilization.""

Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin chief strategy officer Michelle Velasquez called the ruling ""another important step forward in restoring and expanding access to abortion in Wisconsin.""

""This is the judgment we were hoping for, the judgment we knew was right, and hopefully the thing that will restore access to full-scope reproductive care for women across the state,"" said Dr. Kristin Lyerly, a Green Bay OB-GYN and former Democratic state Assembly candidate who intervened in the case and was cited prominently in Schlipper's ruling.

Attorney General Josh Kaul and Gov. Tony Evers, both Democrats, filed the lawsuit shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2022 overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. The court's 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Care effectively put back into place the state's original abortion law.

Passed more than a century before the Roe ruling, the 1849 law was interpreted until now to ban doctors from performing abortions in every case except when the mother will die without the procedure. Doctors face up to six years in prison on felony charges and $10,000 in fines if they violate the law.

Kaul argued in the lawsuit that the 1849 law has been invalidated by abortion laws passed since the Roe v. Wade decision. Anti-abortion proponents and attorneys for Republican lawmakers disagreed, arguing the original law was still in effect.

In July, Schlipper denied a motion to dismiss the lawsuit from defendant Sheboygan District Attorney Joel Urmanski, who had argued that Kaul was asking a judge to perform the duties of lawmakers and was ignoring the fact that lawmakers have put forward language to repeal the original abortion law and decided against passing it.

Following Schlipper's July order, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the state's largest abortion provider, resumed services.

""Freedom wins. Equality wins. Women’s health wins,"" Kaul said in a statement. ""This ruling is a momentous victory, and we are prepared to defend it — and reproductive freedom in Wisconsin.""

Wisconsin Right to Life legislative director Gracie Skogman said the ruling is ""truly disappointing for all Wisconsinites,"" and Pro-Life Wisconsin legislative director Matt Sande called it ""an extraordinary leap in logic."" Sande said his group is hopeful the ruling ""will be appealed promptly.""

""A law that was enforced before the flawed decision of Roe is now one that pro-choice activists on the court are wiling to use as a tool for their cause. Instead, they are putting lives on the line,"" Skogman said.

Julaine Appling, president of the conservative Christian group Wisconsin Family Action, said she wasn't surprised by the decision but looks forward to the case making its way through the judicial process.

""This doesn't change anything about what we're doing,"" Appling said. ""We are about a culture of life, and we're going to promote that and do everything we can to help people to understand that we are about saving babies, but we're also about making sure women are fully informed about this life-taking decision, about options they have, about consequences and encouraging them to explore that, and be very, very careful before they make a decision to have an abortion.""

Appling said her organization supports a package of legislation that includes bills that would classify unborn children as dependents for tax purposes and increase the dependent exemption, fund grants for families seeking to adopt, further define ""abortion"" under state law and prohibit public employees from engaging in abortion-related work within the scope of their government employment.

Under the state's pre-Dobbs laws, women are also required to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion, along with a counseling appointment and a 24-hour waiting period.

In the case of medication abortions, the doctor who administers the pills must be the same one the woman saw for her counseling appointment, and the pills cannot be taken remotely via telemedicine.

The case is expected to make its way to the state Supreme Court, which now has a 4-3 liberal majority. Justice Janet Protasiewicz was sworn in Aug. 1 after running a campaign that focused heavily on broadcasting her personal values to voters, including support for abortion access.

Sep 17 2023,Trump skips Iowa event; abortion is at forefront,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/sep/17/trump-skips-iowa-event-abortion-is-at-forefront,"



DES MOINES, Iowa -- Hoping to cut into Donald Trump's support at a major Iowa gathering of evangelical Christians, several of his top rivals on Saturday mostly avoided direct criticism of him on abortion and other issues key to social conservatives.

The Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition's annual banquet is traditionally a marquee event on the Republican primary calendar. But the former president skipped it, leaving a mostly muted crowd of more than 1,000 pastors and activists to instead hear from several candidates running far behind Trump.

The primary field's split on abortion was once again on display, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis saying restrictions on the procedure should be left to the states -- a position similar to Trump's -- while former Vice President Mike Pence referred to Trump as his ""former running mate"" and said he was wrong to oppose a national abortion ban.

While the audience was overwhelmingly anti-abortion, Pence's push for a 15-week ban got only tepid applause, reflecting some national Republicans' concerns that Democrats are winning on abortion-rights issues after last year's Supreme Court ruling overturning the Roe v. Wade decision.

DeSantis, who has struggled to solidify himself as the GOP primary's No. 2 behind Trump, declined to say he'd back a federal abortion ban. Instead, he said, states have done more on the issue.

""Congress has really struggled to make an impact over the years,"" DeSantis said.

Pence said he disagreed with Trump and argued all Republican presidential candidates should back a federal abortion ban at a minimum of 15 weeks of pregnancy.

""I believe it's an idea whose time has come,"" Pence said. ""We need to stand for the unborn all across America.""

A Trump attack came from former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is a frequent critic of the former president. He said ""there's another candidate, that I respect, but who is not here tonight"" before slamming Trump for saying he wants ""to make both sides happy"" on abortion.

Hutchinson said that unlike Trump, ""both sides aren't going to like me. This is going to be a fight for life.""

Unlike other high-profile events, no one in the audience booed that or any other comment Saturday.

Those criticizing Trump didn't agree on everything. Hutchinson suggested that a House Republican push to open an impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden might be premature given the facts that have been uncovered so far. Pence said he supported that effort.





Gallery: GOP hopefuls spend Saturday in Iowa









The event featured many devout and well-connected social conservatives who can play a decisive role in Iowa's first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses in January. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz used strong appeals to evangelical Republicans to win the GOP's 2016 caucuses.

South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a longtime bachelor, was asked about reports that he has a girlfriend who hasn't been publicly identified. On Saturday, he called her a ""lovely Christian girl"" and asked the crowd, ""Can we just pray together for me?""

He added, ""I just say praise the living God,"" seemingly joking about the Lord's work in finally ensuring he has a girlfriend.

DeSantis was asked specifically to talk about his personal faith and deeply held Catholic beliefs. He noted that when his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer, he was thankful for ""the amount of prayers we received. It lifted my wife's spirits up."" He said prayer was a key reason she was now cancer-free.

Robin Star of Waukee, just west of Des Moines, attended DeSantis' address at the church and said she was glad the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade -- but that Trump doesn't deserve all the credit. Star said she'd nonetheless vote for Trump if he's the Republican nominee, but fears he cannot unify the Republican Party enough heading into the general election against Biden.

Aug 23 2023,"On Debate Stage, Candidates Tangle on Abortion",Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/politics/abortion-mike-pence-ron-desantis/2023/08/23/id/1131845,"The Republican presidential candidates vying to be the leading alternative to front-runner Donald Trump tangled on abortion at the first Republican primary debate Wednesday night, underscoring the party's challenges on the issue after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.

All of the candidates identified as ""pro-life,"" but differed on when restrictions should kick in after the court ended the constitutional right to an abortion, leading to a wave of restrictions in Republican-led states.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is polling a distant second Trump, refused again to say whether he supports a federal ban.

""I'm going to stand on the side of life. Look, I understand Wisconsin is going to do it different than Texas. I understand Iowa and New Hampshire are going to be different, but I will support the cause of life as governor and as president,"" he said.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley again argued for consensus on the issue, arguing passing a federal ban would be highly unlikely without more Republicans in Congress.

""Consensus is the opposite of leadership,"" rebutted former Vice President Mike Pence, who has made his opposition to abortion rights a central tenant of his campaign. Pence supports a federal ban on abortion at six weeks, before many women even know they're pregnant, and has called on the field to back a 15-week national ban as a minimum."
Nov 20 2023,Missouri Supreme Court won’t hear Jay Ascroft’s appeal of abortion ballot summaries,Missouri Independent,left,https://missouriindependent.com/briefs/missouri-supreme-court-wont-hear-jay-ascrofts-appeal-of-abortion-ballot-summaries,"The Missouri Supreme Court has denied Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft’s atrempt to appeal rulings against his ballot summary for initiative petitions seeking to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.

The court also rejected an appeal seeking to reject cost estimates crafted by Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick.

The decisions came down Monday evening, less than a week after Ashcroft asked the state’s highest court to take up the case.

Ashcroft is attempting to keep the wording of a ballot summary he crafted for several abortion-rights initiative petitions stating they would “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions.”

The ballot initiatives were filed in March by St. Louis physician Anna Fitz-James, who proposed 11 different wordings for possible constitutional amendments to legalize abortion in Missouri. Fitz-James filed the proposals on behalf of Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, a political action committee.

As secretary of state, Ashcroft was required to write short neutral summaries for each of the 11 ballot proposals to appear on the ballot before voters on Election Day.

Fitz-James, supported by the ACLU of Missouri, challenged Ashcroft’s language on six of the 11 ballot initiatives. Those who support the initiatives have not yet announced which version they will move forward with in collecting signatures, but each version includes language saying there must be a “compelling government interest” for abortion restrictions to be in place.

Some versions would make abortion legal up until 24 weeks gestation; others would legalize abortion until “fetal viability.”

Ashcroft wrote summaries declaring that the amendments would “nullify longstanding Missouri law protecting the right to life, including but not limited to partial-birth abortion.”

On Oct. 31, a state appeals court called Ashcroft’s summaries “replete with politically partisan language.”

“The use of the term ‘right to life’ is simply not an impartial term,” Judge Thomas Chapman wrote in the court’s unanimous opinion upholding a Cole County judge’s initial decision in favor of the ACLU and Fitz-James.

Ashcroft has said he stands by his summary language, which he argues “fairly and accurately reflects the scope and magnitude of each petition.”

A separate attempt to get abortion on the 2024 ballot has also been filed by longtime GOP operative Jamie Corey. On Friday, her group, called the Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, launched a political action committee and started collecting signatures for an initiative petition that would add some exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, including in cases or rape or incest. It would also legalize abortion prior to 12 weeks gestation.

Corley also sued Ashcroft over the ballot summary he wrote for her original initiative petitions. That lawsuit is ongoing.

In order for any of the abortion amendments to end up on the 2024 ballot, proponents must collect more than 170,000 signatures from registered voters by May.

Abortion has been illegal in Missouri since June 2022. A trigger law went into effect immediately after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized abortion as a constitutional right.

Right now, abortion is only legal in Missouri in emergencies where it is necessary to save the mother’s life or when there is “a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.”"
Nov 21 2023,"Oklahoma sues Biden administration in dispute over abortion, federal family planning funds",Catholic News Agency,right,https://catholicnewsagency.com/news/256072/oklahoma-sues-biden-administration-in-dispute-over-abortion-federal-family-planning-funds,"Oklahoma’s lawsuit says the state has “administered the Title X family planning program in Oklahoma for more than 40 years,” using the grants to “disperse funds through 68 county health departments, who provide critical public health services to rural and urban Oklahoma communities.”

In May of this year, the lawsuit says, HHS pulled Title X funding from the state after having accused it of being “in violation of Title X and out of compliance with the terms and conditions” of the grant, specifically because the state health department “no longer offered pregnant clients the opportunity to be provided information and counseling about abortion/pregnancy termination.”

The state had in 2022 been warned of the requirement to include abortion referrals in its Title X coverage. Oklahoma attempted to “find an agreeable solution with the Health Department that would allow the Health Department to continue receiving Title X funds while complying with Oklahoma law prohibiting abortions,” the lawsuit said.

The state was “unable to find a solution allowing compliance with the regulation and Oklahoma law,” the suit said. The White House ultimately redistributed the Title X funds, including to an out-of-state provider.

The lawsuit is similar to one filed last month by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, who sued the White House in response to its decision to redirect millions of dollars of Title X funding toward Planned Parenthood in the state.

In both cases, the states have been caught in between back-and-forth policy decisions from the Trump and Biden administrations, with both presidents having issued orders to modify Title X policy relating to abortion."
Dec 11 2023,Whitmer signs bill repealing abortion insurance law she fought against a decade ago ⋆ Michigan Advance,Michigan Advance,center,https://michiganadvance.com/2023/12/11/whitmer-signs-bill-repealing-abortion-insurance-law-she-fought-against-a-decade-ago,"It’s been 10 years, to the day, since Gov. Gretchen Whitmer gave a speech as Senate minority leader in an effort to stop Senate Republicans from passing restrictions on health insurance coverage under which individuals would have to purchase a separate insurance rider. Whitmer and other critics slammed it as “rape insurance.”

“I took to the podium and put aside my prepared remarks and shared the story that I had only told a handful of people,” Whitmer said at a news conference Monday at the Capitol. “I talked about the time that I was raped when I was in college.”

And although it was a low moment for Whitmer, who said she felt despondent knowing that she had not changed anyone’s minds — and she would have to call her dad to warn him about what would be in the newspapers — she said she knew the fight wasn’t over.

On Monday, Whitmer signed the final bill in the Reproductive Health Act, House Bill 4949, which repeals the health insurance restrictions among other reforms. The package altogether removes some Targeted Regulations of Abortion Providers, commonly known as TRAP laws, amongst other measures.

Since Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, Whitmer said the fight to save reproductive freedom went into overdrive. Since then, several victories in that fight have been won in Michigan and other states.

In November 2022, voters approved Proposal 3, which codified the right to abortion in Michigan’s constitution. In April, Whitmer signed a repeal of a 1931 law Michigan had on the books banning abortion.

And although Whitmer said her sexual assault in college didn’t result in a pregnancy, the idea that someone else could be in her position did not sit well with her.

“The moral of this story is don’t stop fighting for what you know is right,” Whitmer said. “There’s a warning in the story, too, [to] anyone who wants to roll back our rights: Don’t mess with American women; we’re tough and we fight back and we will win. You come for our rights and we will work harder to protect them.”

Whitmer added that although it meant a lot to repeal a law she had long fought against, today is not about her, but about every woman in Michigan.

The stories of survivors are valuable, but it shouldn’t take women revealing the painful events of their past to make progress, bill sponsor Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) said at the news conference. She said she has regrets about making a speech similar to Whitmer’s when she was in her first term, recounting her own rape and subsequent pregnancy scare.

“I wish I had actually never given that speech at all. Not because it was personally painful, which it was, but because it made the wrong point. Trauma is not a requirement for bodily autonomy. Each person’s reason for getting an abortion is personal and valid and everyone is deserving of the ability to make their own decisions about their pregnancy,” Pohutsky said. “I long for a day where female elected officials do not have to open up their wounds on the chamber floor to appeal to the humanity of our colleagues.”"
Nov 20 2023,Missouri Supreme Court rejects Ashcroft's attempt to appeal abortion ballot language fight,St. Louis Post-Dispatch,center,https://stltoday.com/news/local/government-politics/missouri-supreme-court-rejects-ashcrofts-attempt-to-appeal-abortion-ballot-language-fight/article_8c5e178e-880b-11ee-965b-7359209a5add.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — The Missouri Supreme Court late Monday handed a loss to Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft in a fight over the ballot summary of a possible abortion rights initiative petition in 2024.

After the Cole County Circuit Court and the Missouri Court of Appeals at Kansas City scrapped ballot summaries Ashcroft proposed for six abortion initiative petitions, the elections chief appealed to the Missouri Supreme Court to take the case.

But the Missouri Supreme Court late Monday rejected transfer of the case in question, keeping the lower court ruling intact.

The high court also declined to take up a separate case by two Republican lawmakers and a third plaintiff challenging fiscal estimates by Republican Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick, again allowing the appeals court decision to stand.

Ashcroft’s ballot summary asked if voters wanted to “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.”

In a ruling written by Judge Thomas Chapman, a three-judge panel of the appeals court agreed Ashcroft crossed a line.

“The Secretary’s summary statements are replete with politically partisan language,” Chapman wrote.

Most of the six proposed initiative petitions at issue would allow the state to restrict abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy or fetal viability. One of the versions contains no gestational limits on abortion.

A ballot summary for one of the questions containing limits, approved by the appeals court, asks Missouri voters if they want to amend the constitution to:

establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives, with any governmental interference of that right presumed invalid;

remove Missouri’s ban on abortion;

allow regulation of reproductive health care to improve or maintain the health of the patient;

require the government not to discriminate, in government programs, funding, and other activities, against persons providing or obtaining reproductive health care; and

allow abortion to be restricted or banned after Fetal Viability except to protect the life or health of the woman?

Wording for the same question proposed by Ashcroft asked if voters wanted to amend the constitution to:

allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice;

nullify longstanding Missouri law protecting the right to life, including but not limited to partial-birth abortion;

allow for laws to be enacted regulating abortion procedures after Fetal Viability, while guaranteeing the right of any woman, including a minor, to end the life of their unborn child at any time; and

require the government not to discriminate against persons providing or obtaining an abortion, potentially including tax-payer funding?

It was unclear whether a coalition of abortion-rights supporters would emerge to support one of the ballot questions originally filed in March by the group Missourians for Constitutional Freedom.

Since then, a former GOP congressional staffer has launched a separate effort that would be less expansive than the measures at issue Monday."

The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act is meant to ensure that all patients who request emergency room treatment are examined, but Idaho argued in its court filing Monday that the law turns ""protection for the uninsured into a federal super-statute on the issue of abortion, one that strips Idaho of its sovereign interest in protecting innocent human life and turns emergency rooms into a federal enclave where state standards of care do not apply.""

After the Supreme Court overruled the landmark 1973 abortion case Roe v. Wade last year, Idaho passed a law banning abortions, with few exceptions for rape, incest or threat to a mother's life.

The federal government sued Idaho, citing the Emergency Medical Treatment act, and argued that the law ""creates a federal right to abortion in emergency rooms, even though [the law] is silent on abortion and actually requires stabilizing treatment for the unborn children of pregnant women,"" Idaho's filing states.

Jul 23 2023,Understanding abortion law in Iowa,Cedar Rapids Gazette,not-yet-rated,https://thegazette.com/guest-columnists/understanding-abortion-law-in-iowa,"On June 16, the Iowa Supreme Court let stand an Iowa District Court ruling declining to modify a 2019 Judgment granting an injunction against Iowa’s 2018 fetal heartbeat bill as unconstitutional. The District Court ruling was upheld on a technicality. The Supreme Court was tied with three votes to affirm the ruling, because it was too late to change the 2019 Judgment, three votes to resurrect the law, and one Justice abstaining because the law firm she left was involved in the case. One of the usual suspects immediately called for removal of the justices who voted to uphold the 2019 judgment, claiming they went outside their jurisdiction. In fact, the three did the opposite. They merely recognized they had no jurisdiction to change a final judgment that was four years old, and abided by the long-standing judicial recognition of the finality of judgments.

In 2019, a District Court judge permanently enjoined the 2018 fetal heartbeat bill as unconstitutional. The State of Iowa did not appeal that ruling. However, in June 2022, the Iowa Supreme Court narrowed protections for abortion under the Iowa Constitution. A week later the U.S. Supreme Court abolished federal abortion rights. In response Gov. Kim Reynolds decided it was politically safer to try and change the 2019 judgment rather than pass and sign a new fetal heartbeat bill. The three Justices who voted to affirm did not state their position on abortion rights. Rather, they merely recognized there were no legal grounds to modify the 2019 final judgment. The three Justices who voted to affirm are not wide-eyed liberals. In fact, it was widely-reported Justice Edward Mansfield was on President Donald Trump’s list of potential U.S. Supreme Court nominees. It may be more surprising three justices felt it was appropriate to resurrect a law struck down as unconstitutional by a new court decision rather than legislative action. Some might call that “judicial activism.”

There is another unusual procedural aspect with this decision. A District Court judgment subject to an appeal is affirmed as a matter of law as a result of a tie. When that happens the justices rarely provide any written explanation because any explanation is not considered an opinion that is legal precedent. In this case, the three Justices who voted to resurrect the law wrote an explanation, so Justice Waterman also wrote to explain the many reasons why he, Justice Mansfield, and Chief Justice Christensen, had no authority to overturn the final judgment in this case, even though federal and Iowa constitutional law had changed. To better understand what happened, it is appropriate to first review the different standards applicable to review of constitutional objections to statutes, and then address the history of recent Iowa Supreme Court abortion decisions.

There are three standards of review of the constitutionality of statutes. The highest form of review is strict scrutiny which a court applies to laws which infringe upon fundamental constitutional rights. The law is presumptively invalid unless the government can demonstrate it is necessary to achieve a compelling state interest and the means are narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. Another test is the undue burden standard which provides a particular law cannot be too burdensome or restrictive of a right. This was the constitutional test ultimately adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1992 in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld some restrictions on the right to abortion. The usual standard of review of constitutional challenges is rational basis, where the court determines whether the law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, with a presumption favoring constitutionality.

A review of recent Iowa abortion decision starts with Planned Parenthood v. Board of Medicine, 865 N. W. 2d 252 (Iowa 2015), a challenge to a rule prohibiting administration of abortion medication by telemedicine. A unanimous Iowa Supreme Court struck down the statute and adopted the undue burden standard. This was followed by Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds, 915 N. W. 2d 206 (Iowa 2018), which struck down a 72-hour waiting period, recognized abortion was a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution, and adopted the strict scrutiny standard. Justices Mansfield and Waterman dissented. Given Iowa constitutional law, backstopped by the Federal undue burden standard under Casey, the governor declined to appeal the 2019 District Court ruling finding the fetal heartbeat bill unconstitutional.

Last year saw many changes in abortion jurisprudence, first in Iowa, and then nationally. In Planned Parenthood v. Reynolds, 975 N. W. 2d 710 (Iowa 2022), a very divided Iowa Supreme Court upheld a 24-hour waiting period, specifically overruled the 2018 decision and found strict scrutiny did not apply. The Iowa Supreme Court recognized continued application of the undue burden standard was not raised by the Governor and did not address whether that standard should be changed. A week later, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Dobbs.

At this point, the governor and abortion opponents had two choices. A new fetal heartbeat bill could be reenacted when the Legislature next convened. However, the reaction of the electorate to Dobbs and abortion restrictions was evident by August, 2022 when Kansas voters resoundingly defeated abortion restrictions. Shortly thereafter, the governor opted for a politically safer approach, specifically legal action to try and revive the fetal heartbeat bill in Court by trying to modify the 2019 judgment.

The rationale expressed by the justices who voted in June to uphold the 2019 judgment made clear there was no legal basis to modify that judgment and resurrect the 2018 law. Those justices made clear this was a matter for the Legislature and governor. They also gave no opinion as to what standard of review would govern if, or more likely when, abortion rights came before the Court again. Therefore, the undue burden standard adopted in 2015 remained the law of Iowa. While the view of the other three Justices is more predictable, it can’t be predicted whether the full court will follow undue burden or rational basis review.

Regardless, the Legislature promptly reenacted a new fetal heartbeat bill, essentially the same as what was previously enacted, which was signed by the Governor on Friday, July 14. The same day a hearing on a constitutional challenge to the new law seeking an injunction was heard in Polk County District Court.

On Monday, July 17, the Polk County District Court granted a temporary injunction against enforcing the law. A party seeking an injunction must show the likelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted and that an injunction is warranted balancing the harm a temporary injunction may prevent against the harm resulting from granting the injunction. The District Court recognized undue burden remained the standard in Iowa and properly declined to speculate whether the Iowa Supreme Court would change that on appeal. Therefore, under existing Iowa law, the challenge was likely to be successful. The Court recognized both sides “ … are good, honorable and intelligent people — morally, politically and legally …” but found the existing standard in Iowa tipped the balance in favor of enjoining the law.

The District Court properly made one exception. The new statute directed the Iowa Board of Medicine to adopt rules governing enforcement. The Iowa Supreme Court may abandon the undue burden standard when this case comes before it, and uphold the law. The District Court recognized the medical profession needs more certainty in addressing the circumstances under which physicians can terminate pregnancies to protect the health of the mother. Lack of certainty has adversely affected the health of pregnant women in states that have recently banned abortions, as physicians will error on the side of not performing an abortion, with adverse consequences to a pregnant woman’s health.

Given the recognition the undue burden standard remains the law of Iowa, it is highly likely the District Court will make the injunction permanent after a full trial. Then Iowans will wait to see what standard of review the Iowa Supreme Court will adopt, as that issue will be squarely presented to the court.

Nov 27 2023,Idaho asks Supreme Court to let abortion law that penalizes doctors to take full effect,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/11/27/politics/idaho-abortion-supreme-court-appeal/index.html,"CNN —

Idaho asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow its state abortion ban that imposes penalties on doctors who perform abortions to take full effect despite federal requirements for emergency room doctors.

The case comes to the high court more than a year after the justices overturned a constitutional right to abortion, altering the landscape of abortion rights nationwide and triggering more than half the states, including Idaho, to outlaw or severely restrict the procedure.

Idaho’s Defense of Life Act is a near total ban on abortion, but there is an exception to prevent the mother’s death. The law imposes penalties on doctors who perform prohibited abortions unless the “physician determined in good faith medical judgement and based on the facts known to the physician at the time, that the abortion was necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.” Physicians who violate the law could face criminal penalties and risks the suspension of their licenses.

But a district court blocked the law in hospital emergency rooms that receive Medicare funding, holding that the state law interferes with a federal Medicare statute.

The United States sued, claiming that a provision of a federal Medicare statue – the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) preempts Idaho’s law in emergency rooms. The federal law requires hospitals to provide stabilizing care to emergency room patients regardless of their ability to pay. The law was enacted to ensure that the poor and uninsured receive emergency medical care at hospitals receiving Medicare reimbursement.

In 2022 Judge B. Lynn Winmill of the US District Court for the District of Idaho said that the “broad scope” of Idaho’s near total ban on abortion meant that he was not convinced that it would be possible for emergency health care workers to “simultaneously comply with obligations” under both state and federal law. “The state law must therefore yield to federal law to the extent of that conflict.”

A federal appeals court initially agreed to put the district court ruling on hold pending appeal, but a larger panel of judges on the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the stay on November 13.

Now the state, represented by a conservative legal group that opposes abortion, is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to put the district court ruling on hold while appeals play out.

“After Dobbs,” Erin Hawley a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom told the justices in court papers, “the United States adopted the novel view that EMTALA creates a federal right to abortion in emergency rooms, even though EMTALA is silent on abortion and actually requires stabilizing for the unborn children of pregnant women.”

A similar case is pending in Texas."
Nov 10 2023,Ohio Republicans Say It's Their 'God Given Right' to Restrict Abortion Access,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ohio-republicans-stop-issue-1-abortion-rights-1234875333,"Ohio Republicans are claiming a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights, which was approved by voters in Tuesday’s election, doesn’t actually do that — and they’re promising to take steps to prevent the legal protection of reproductive freedom in the state.

“To prevent mischief by pro-abortion courts with Issue 1, Ohio legislators will consider removing jurisdiction from the judiciary over this ambiguous ballot initiative,” Ohio House Republicans wrote in a statement released Thursday. “The Ohio legislature alone will consider what, if any, modifications to make to existing laws based on public hearings and input from legal experts on both sides.”

Ohio banned abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, but legal challenges to state’s abortion laws left residents’ reproductive rights in limbo until Tuesday’s ballot measure. The strategy Republicans are now proposing would essentially strip Ohio’s courts of the authority to repeal existing abortion restrictions before the new amendment goes into effect on December 7.

“No amendment can overturn the God-given rights with which we were born,” state Rep. Beth Lear (R-Galena) added in the Republican’s statement. Another representative, Jennifer Gross (R-West Chester), claimed the referendum had only passed due to “foreign election interference.”

Rep. Bill Dean (R-Xenia) said the amendment “doesn’t repeal a single Ohio law,” and that its language is “dangerously vague and unconstrained, and can be weaponized to attack parental rights or defend rapists, pedophiles, and human traffickers.”

Ohio is not the only state where Republicans are attempting to undermine pro-choice ballot initiatives endorsed by constituents. In Michigan, two anti-choice activist groups are working with Republican lawmakers to sue the state and block the implementation of that state’s voter-approved constitutional amendment.

Stacey LaRouche, press secretary to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, told The Detroit News that “it shouldn’t be lost on people that these right-wing organizations and radical Republicans in the Michigan Legislature are cherry-picking courts to try to once again overturn a constitutionally guaranteed right because they can’t win with voters.”

Ballot measures supporting reproductive freedom have been approved in all seven states where they have been put to voters. Despite Republicans claiming that the end of Roe signified the return of the abortion issue to the will of individual states, they clearly remain determined to undermine reproductive rights no matter what any state’s voters have to say about them."
Nov 09 2023,Federal judge puts Idaho’s ‘abortion trafficking’ law on hold during lawsuit,Todays Chronic,left,https://todayschronic.com/federal-judge-puts-idahos-abortion-trafficking-law-on-hold-during-lawsuit,"BOISE, Idaho — A federal judge has temporarily blocked Idaho’s “abortion trafficking” law from being enforced while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality is underway.

“This lawsuit is not about the right to an abortion. It is about much more,” U.S. District Magistrate Debora K. Grasham wrote in the ruling handed down Wednesday. “Namely, long-standing and well recognized fundamental rights of freedom of speech, expression, due process, and parental rights. These are not competing rights, nor are they at odds.”

Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in May was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don’t have their parents’ permission. Under the law, people who help a minor who isn’t their own child arrange an abortion out of state can be charged with a felony, though they can then attempt to defend themselves in court later by proving that the minor had parental permission for the trip.

Supporters of the law call it an “abortion trafficking” ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights.

Two advocacy groups and an attorney who works with sexual assault victims sued the state and Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador over the law earlier this year. Nampa attorney Lourdes Matsumoto, the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, and the Indigenous Idaho Alliance all work with and sometimes assist minors who are seeking abortions, and they wrote in the lawsuit that they wanted to continue without the threat of prosecution.

They said the law is so vague that they can’t tell what conduct would or would not be legal, and that it violates the First Amendment right of free expression. They also argued that the law infringes on the Fourth Amendment right to travel between states, as well as the right to travel within Idaho.

Grasham agreed with the state’s attorneys that there is no court-protected right of travel within the state under existing case law in Idaho, and she dismissed that part of the lawsuit. But she said the other three claims could move forward, noting that the plaintiffs’ intended assistance to minors is essentially an expression of their core beliefs, in the form of messages of “support and solidarity for individuals seeking legal reproductive options.”

The judge wrote that she wasn’t placing free expression or due process above parental rights or vice versa, saying those rights have co-existed in harmony for decades and can continue to do so.

“The state can, and Idaho does, criminalize certain conduct occurring within its own borders such as abortion, kidnapping, and human trafficking. What the state cannot do is craft a statute muzzling the speech and expressive activities of a particular viewpoint with which the state disagrees under the guise of parental rights,” she wrote.

Prosecutors in eastern Idaho recently charged a woman and her son with second-degree kidnapping, alleging they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. The prosecutors did not invoke the so-called “abortion trafficking” law in that case. Instead, they said the criminal kidnapping charge was brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.”

The woman’s defense attorney did not immediately return a phone call. seeking comment The son’s court file was not available online, and it wasn’t immediately clear if the case against him was still underway."

They also argued that the law infringes on the Fourth Amendment right to travel between states, as well as the right to travel within Idaho.

Grasham agreed with the state's attorneys that there is no court-protected right of travel within the state under existing case law in Idaho, and she dismissed that part of the lawsuit. But she said the other three claims could move forward, noting that the plaintiffs' intended assistance to minors is essentially an expression of their core beliefs, in the form of messages of “support and solidarity for individuals seeking legal reproductive options.”

The judge wrote that she wasn't placing free expression or due process above parental rights or vice versa, saying those rights have co-existed in harmony for decades and can continue to do so.

“The state can, and Idaho does, criminalize certain conduct occurring within its own borders such as abortion, kidnapping, and human trafficking. What the state cannot do is craft a statute muzzling the speech and expressive activities of a particular viewpoint with which the state disagrees under the guise of parental rights,” she wrote.

Prosecutors in eastern Idaho recently charged a woman and her son with second-degree kidnapping, alleging they took the son's minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion. The prosecutors did not invoke the so-called “abortion trafficking” law in that case. Instead, they said the criminal kidnapping charge was brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.”

The woman's defense attorney did not immediately return a phone call. seeking comment The son's court file was not available online, and it wasn't immediately clear if the case against him was still underway."
Dec 09 2023,"Kate Cox can't get abortion for now, Texas Supreme Court says, halting lower court's OK",Austin American-Statesman,center,https://statesman.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/12/09/texas-supreme-court-blocks-kate-coxs-emergency-abortion-approval/71864228007,"The Texas Supreme Court has paused a Travis County judge's decision to allow a woman to terminate a pregnancy in which her fetus has a fatal diagnosis.

Travis County state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble’s order in question was issued Thursday morning, and it had blocked the state from enforcing its strict abortion ban in the case of Kate Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two from the Dallas area. The state Supreme Court late Friday night issued its administrative stay and said it intends to consider Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's petition, filed late Thursday, to reverse Gamble’s decision.

In his petition, Paxton argued the state would suffer an ""irreparable loss"" should Cox terminate her pregnancy.

""Because the life of an unborn child is at stake, the Court should require a faithful application of Texas statutes prior to determining that an abortion is permitted,"" Paxton's request reads.

Cox's attorney, Molly Duane, said the temporary hold keeps Cox from accessing urgently needed medical care.

“While we still hope that the Court ultimately rejects the state’s request and does so quickly, in this case we fear that justice delayed will be justice denied,” Duane, senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement Friday night.

Cox was 20 weeks and three days pregnant as of Friday afternoon, according to her attorneys' response to Paxton's appeal. The attorney general's petition could have been deemed moot if Cox had obtained the abortion while the restraining order was still in effect, but that would have depended on a court's interpretation, said Seema Mohapatra, a Southern Methodist University professor of health law.

Paxton's appeal could allow him to test his arguments against the restraining order when the Supreme Court takes up his petition. Those arguments were central to an advisory letter he sent Thursday to three Houston hospitals where Cox’s OB-GYN holds privileges, claiming that the judge's temporary restraining order would not shield the plaintiffs or the hospitals from criminal charges or fines.

Cox's fetus has trisomy 18, a deadly genetic condition. She has been admitted to emergency rooms four times in the past month — including one visit since the case was filed — after experiencing severe cramping and fluid leaks, Duane told the District Court Thursday.

Several doctors have advised Cox that there is ""virtually no chance"" her baby will survive and that carrying the pregnancy to term would make it less likely that she will be able to carry another child in the future, according to the complaint.

In an interview with ""NBC Nightly News"" on Thursday, Cox said she was ""hopeful"" about the District Court's decision in her favor but that her family will be grieving over their unborn child's fatal diagnosis regardless.

""Even with being hopeful with the decision that came from the hearing (on Thursday), there’s still — we’re going through the loss of a child,"" Cox said. ""There’s no outcome here that I take home my healthy baby girl. So, it’s hard."""
Sep 12 2023,Women sue Idaho over abortion ban,The Columbian,center,https://columbian.com/news/2023/sep/12/women-sue-idaho-over-abortion-ban,"BOISE, Idaho — Earlier this year, Jennifer Adkins learned during a 12-week ultrasound that her second child — nicknamed “Spooky” because she was due near Halloween — was unlikely to survive her pregnancy.

Adkins said doctors told her the likely miscarriage could result in mirror syndrome, a rare disorder that would cause her to experience the same life-threatening symptoms as the fetus. Adkins recalled that her medical providers were “visibly distraught” when they told her Idaho law prevented them from performing an abortion. After traveling to Oregon for a legal abortion, Adkins said she and her husband struggled to pay their mortgage.

Now Adkins is suing the state alongside a group of doctors and three Idaho other women who were also denied abortions despite dangerous pregnancy complications. The legal complaint asks a court to clarify the circumstances that are grounds for a legal abortion in Idaho, which bans the procedure in all cases unless it was necessary to prevent the death of a pregnant patient.

“It isn’t safe to be pregnant in Idaho,” Adkins told reporters during a news conference Tuesday. “People in Idaho must be able to make informed decisions with their doctors, without the intrusion from politics. What I needed was an abortion, a safe and standard medical procedure that is often required to save lives and keep families intact.”"

Oct 16 2023,Candidates wrangle over abortion policy in Kentucky gubernatorial debate,San Diego Union-Tribune,left,https://sandiegouniontribune.com/news/nation-world/story/2023-10-16/candidates-wrangle-over-abortion-policy-in-kentucky-gubernatorial-debate,"Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, left, and Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron shake hands at a gubernatorial debate at Northern Kentucky University, in Highland Heights, Ky., Monday, Oct. 16, 2023. (Joe Simon/LINK nky via AP, Pool)

Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron accused each other of taking extreme stands on abortion policy Monday night as they wrangled over an issue that’s become a flashpoint in their hotly contested campaign for governor in Kentucky.

During an hourlong debate at Northern Kentucky University in Highland Heights, Kentucky, the rivals fielded questions over education, taxes, public safety and the monthlong strike by autoworkers, which has spread to Ford’s highly profitable Kentucky Truck Plant in Louisville.

The candidates tried to one-up the other in their support for public education. Some of their sharpest exchanges during the televised debate, however, came when asked to lay out their stands on abortion.

Their remarks, which took place about three weeks before the Nov. 7 election, came against the backdrop of Kentucky’s current abortion law, which bans the procedure except when carried out to save a pregnant woman’s life or to prevent a disabling injury.

Beshear said that his challenger celebrated the abortion ban’s passage and pointed to Cameron’s long-running support for the law as written, without exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest.

“My opponent’s position would give a rapist more rights than their victim,” Beshear said. “It is wrong. We need to change this law. We need to make sure that those individuals have that option.”

Once Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, the state’s trigger law — passed in 2019 — took effect to ban nearly all abortions.

Cameron reiterated Monday night that he would sign a bill adding abortion exceptions if given the chance, a position he revealed during a radio interview last month.

Cameron went on the attack by pointing to Beshear’s opposition to abortion restrictions passed by the state’s GOP-dominated legislature. As attorney general, Beshear refused to defend a law imposing a 20-week ban on abortion, and later as governor he vetoed a 15-week ban, Cameron said.

“That is Andy Beshear’s record on the issue of life,” Cameron said. “It’s one of failure for the unborn.”

Beshear responded that he has consistently supported “reasonable restrictions,” especially on late-term abortions. Beshear also noted that the 15-week ban lacked exceptions for rape and incest.

Abortion polices have been at the forefront of the campaign. Beshear’s campaign released a TV ad last month featuring a Kentucky woman who revealed her own childhood trauma while calling for rape and incest exceptions. The woman, now in her early 20s, talked about having been raped by her stepfather when she was 12 years old. She became pregnant as a seventh grader but eventually miscarried.

Meanwhile, the candidates took turns touting their plans to improve public education.

Cameron accused the governor of mischaracterizing his plan to help students overcome learning loss when schools were closed during the pandemic.

“We need a governor that is going to lean into this issue to fight for our kids and make sure that they have the best education system here possible in Kentucky,” Cameron said.

Beshear highlighted his own plan calling for an 11% pay raise for teachers and all public school personnel, including bus drivers, janitors and cafeteria staff. He said he’s supported educators “every step of the way” to raise their pay and protect their pensions as governor and previously as attorney general.

“If we want to make sure that we have a math teacher, a physics teacher, everything we need in our classrooms, we have to pay people closer to what they’re worth,” the governor said.

Beshear also made another pitch for his plan for state-funded pre-K for every 4-year-old in Kentucky.

Beshear criticized Cameron for supporting a Republican-backed measure to award tax credits for donations supporting private school tuition. The Kentucky Supreme Court struck down the measure last year. The governor and other opponents of the bill said the program would have diverted money from public schools. Supporters said the measure offered opportunities for parents who want new schooling options for their children but are unable to afford them.

“He (Cameron) supports a voucher program that would take tens of millions of dollars out of our public school system,” Beshear said. “Out of the paychecks of our educators, out of the resources that they need, and again send them to fancy private schools.”

Cameron has proposed raising the statewide base starting pay for new teachers, saying it would have a ripple effect by lifting pay for other teachers. Cameron’s plan also would develop an optional, 16-week tutoring program for math and reading instruction.

“We need leadership that’s going to catch our kids up,” Cameron said.

The candidates were asked to weigh in on the targeted strikes by the United Auto Workers union at all three Detroit automakers. Beshear replied that “this isn’t an either-or. We need the UAW to come out in a strong place and Ford to come out in a strong place, too.”

Ford is a major employer in Louisville with two assembly plants in Kentucky’s largest city. Ford and its battery partner, SK Innovation of South Korea, are building twin battery plants outside Glendale in central Kentucky — a $5.8 billion megaproject landed during Beshear’s tenure as governor.

Cameron expressed support for the workers while saying he hopes for a swift resolution. He blamed the labor dispute on President Joe Biden’s economic policies, part of his effort to nationalize the campaign by linking Beshear to the Democratic president — a well-used GOP strategy in red states like Kentucky.

“We are in this mess because of the inflationary pressures that are coming from Washington, D.C.,” Cameron said."

Nov 08 2023,Ohio abortion vote excites liberals but it may not predict 2024 Democratic wins,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/politics/elections/ohio-abortion-vote-excites-liberals-may-not-predict-2024-democratic-wi-rcna124204,"After conservative Ohio voted on Tuesday by more than 13 points to enshrine abortion protections in the state constitution, speculation began immediately about how a liberal cause had fared so well and what that will mean for elections going forward.

Pro-abortion rights activists managed to flip four counties that previously voted for the August ballot initiative that was widely seen as a proxy vote for abortion. And in comparison to the 2020 election, when President Joe Biden won only seven counties in the state, the results were a landslide.

Democrats aren't entirely united on why they garnered such a dramatic victory, but theories abound. Ohioans don't want the government in their business. Disinformation enraged and mobilized pro-abortion rights voters. College students weren't on campus in August. Political pundits are still underestimating how much the overturning of Roe v. Wade infuriated voters.

But all the theories underscore one fact: Even in a conservative state, abortion mobilizes voters in favor of Democrats.

And while there is little doubt that the White House was elated about Tuesday's results looking ahead to Biden's re-election bid, the fine print in Ohio still offers some worrying signs for the president.

Biden’s re-election campaign posted a series of videos to X depicting Donald Trump taking credit for the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

“I did something that nobody thought was possible,” Trump said in a video. “I got rid of Roe v. Wade.”

“As he’s said many times, no one did more to pave the way for abortion bans than Trump, and he was proud and honored to do it,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa in a statement shared first with NBC News. “Republicans across the country are tied to Trump’s losing MAGA agenda of ripping away Americans’ fundamental freedoms and voters will hold Donald Trump and his MAGA buddies accountable next November.”

Pro-abortion rights activists won 25 counties, up from 22 in August when the state voted on a referendum to change the threshold for future ballot initiatives that was largely seen as a proxy vote on the abortion issue. Of those 25 counties, 18 voted for Donald Trump in 2020, including all four counties the pro-abortion rights activists flipped since August — three ringing Columbus and one north of Cincinnati.

One of the counties near Columbus, Union County, voted for the amendment by a slim 1.8 percentage point margin after going to Trump by more than 30 points in 2020.

""It's always been a joke in Union County that, 'Oh, there's, there's another Democrat here,'"" said Tenah McMahan, chair of the Union County Democratic Party. She described her county as composed of mostly unaffiliated voters: a purple county with a ""pretty strong fuchsia tinge.""

She's not sure Union County will stay blue in 2024, but pointed to ""staggering"" growth in the county as a reason it saw a shift from the August to November votes.

Other Democrats pointed to a higher voter turnout as a reason their standings across counties improved since August. November's election saw an increase of more than 760,000 voters heading to the polls compared to August's vote.

Kathy Wyenandt, chair of Butler County Democrats, said she thinks fewer people were aware of August's election. Abortion rights supporters flipped Butler after it narrowly voted for the August measure, associated with being anti-abortion. Despite the flip, Democrats' strategy in Butler remained the same for the August vote, Wyenandt said.

""November's election had a little bit more steam with both the Issue 1 and Issue 2 being large,"" she said. Issue 1 was about abortion rights, while Issue 2 was about legalizing marijuana. Both passed.

A few key constituencies that supported Ohio's abortion amendment included Black voters, voters under 30 and women under 45, according to an NBC News exit poll.

""Suburban women don't like extremism,"" said Katie Paris, founder of Red Wine & Blue, an organization focused on mobilizing suburban women. ""Suburban women have been very angry about the overturn of Roe, and we're seeing in state after state and now even county after county a resounding rejection of attacks on reproductive freedom.""

Ohio's abortion vote comes just one year before voters head back to the polls for both a presidential and Senate election. Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for re-election next year, but faces a tough bid for a fourth term in a state that has increasingly veered to the right in statewide elections. In 2022, Republicans JD Vance and Mike DeWine won their Senate and gubernatorial races, respectively.

Brown highlighted the difference between his and his opponent's stances on abortion when asked about his takeaways from Ohio's Tuesday election.

The election ""tells me that Ohioans understand that women and doctors should make that decision, not politicians in Columbus,"" Brown said. ""All three of my opponents are for a national abortion ban, and they are out of step with the reality in my state.”

Senate GOP candidates Bernie Moreno, Frank LaRose and Matt Dolan all opposed the abortion amendment.

""This is about protecting innocent life, protecting parental rights, and protecting our children,"" LaRose's campaign account posted to X. ""Join us in voting NO on 1!""

LaRose is also Ohio's secretary of state and was embroiled in controversy when the Ohio Supreme Court handed the LaRose-led Ballot Board a victory, allowing them to keep controversial ballot language in place, including referring to a fetus as an ""unborn child.""

The Biden administration, campaign and Democratic National Committee touted Ohio's election results as proof that voters were rejecting the GOP's ""extreme"" agenda.

""Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans ... "" President Joe Biden said in a statement.

Next November, Biden will still need to overcome low approval ratings and a supermajority of Ohioans who want to see someone else run. Seventy-two percent of Ohio voters believe that Biden should not be running for president in 2024, according to an NBC News exit poll.

But Ohio Democrats point to Tuesday's results as a reason for optimism, arguing it may be evidence that voters are turning away from Trump, despite the state going to him in 2020 by about 8 points.

""I think that there are a large number of people who voted for Donald Trump in 2020, who now realized that they were sold a false bill of goods on not only what he could deliver, but who he is,"" said Chris Anderson, chair of the Mahoning County Democratic Party. Mahoning narrowly went to Trump in 2020, but voted in favor of the abortion protection amendment.

Democrats, including Biden, can work to fix their brands in Ohio by focusing on the issues mobilizing Ohio voters, said David Pepper, former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party.

""We're a very pro-union state. We're a very — clearly a pro-choice state. We just legalized marijuana decisively,"" Pepper said. ""Every one of those things is what Democrats are for and Republicans are against."""
Nov 17 2023,Biden Judicial Nominee Pledged To Ignore Oklahoma Abortion Law — Then Lied About It To Congress,The Federalist,right,https://thefederalist.com/2023/11/17/biden-judicial-nominee-pledged-to-ignore-oklahoma-abortion-law-then-lied-about-it-to-congress/,"Image Credit Senator John Kennedy/ YouTube

Oklahoma district judge nominee Sara Hill apparently lied about her previous pledge to ignore state abortion laws on Cherokee Nation land following the historic Dobbs v. Jackson ruling. Hill, a Cherokee herself, was previously attorney general of the Cherokee Nation.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, asked Hill whether she had said that she “had no intent to enforce the law post-Dobbs.” Hill responded by claiming she “never said that.” However, video footage from her time as attorney general demonstrates otherwise.

In a recording, Hill can be heard saying she would not update any procedures in her tribal office to enforce abortion laws passed in the state of Oklahoma post-Dobbs.

Thanks to @BasedMikeLee for taking radical Biden judicial nominee Sara Hill to task over her abortion stance highlighted in the video we released earlier this week https://t.co/IieTuld61p pic.twitter.com/B0e1vjhUGG — Oversight Project (@OversightPR) November 16, 2023

Saying she would not enforce Oklahoma law and then claiming she didn’t only scratches the surface of Wednesday’s disastrous nomination hearing. In a now-viral and embarrassing clip of the hearing, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked Hill to explain the difference between a “stay order” and an “injunction.”

Hill could not answer the question. After stuttering and failing to come up with definitions, Hill responded, “I’m not sure that I actually can give you the — uh — that.”

🚨President Biden’s district judge nominee Sara Hill was unable to explain to @SenJohnKennedy the difference between a “stay order” and an “injunction.”



How can an individual who wants to be a federal judge possibly not know this?



Senator Durbin even congratulated Hill… pic.twitter.com/6oJAKqhN3I — Carrie Severino (@JCNSeverino) November 15, 2023

Leftist groups are ecstatic over Hill’s nomination because Hill would “be the first Native American woman to ever serve a lifetime appointment on a federal court in Oklahoma.” As Kennedy demonstrated, however, checking off diversity boxes does not make you qualified for a federal judgeship.

“Identity politics is ruining this country by elevating people to positions they couldn’t otherwise ascend to based on merit,” political commentator Carl Jackson wrote on X, formerly Twitter, in reaction to Hill’s exchange with Kennedy. “By the end of the first year of law school there wasn’t a student in the class that couldn’t answer that with ease,” chimed in another X user. “Did Sara Hill get her law degree from a Cracker Jack box? Or was it simply Woke University No Education School of Law?”

There are more reasons to oppose Hill’s nomination than just her inability to define basic legal terms. As the Cherokee Nation’s attorney general, Hill supported the McGirt v. Oklahoma Supreme Court decision, which revoked Oklahoma’s ability to prosecute tribal members in the eastern half of the state. Now, cases involving tribal members in a large portion of the state are under native jurisdiction.

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt described the ensuing jurisdictional fights between the state and the tribes as “a fight for the very fabric of our state.”

Stitt, who is himself a member of the Cherokee Nation, opposes Hill’s nomination, writing in a statement last month, “Is the best choice an attorney general of a tribal government who has spent a great deal of time and resources actively suing the state of Oklahoma in an effort to overturn 116 years of Statehood and working to strip the state of our authority to enforce laws?”

Despite Wednesday’s shameful hearing, Biden is not done making diversity nominations. That same day, the president announced five more federal judicial nominees — three of which are “diversity” picks.

Nicole Berner, a lesbian and the general counsel of the Service Employees International Union, was nominated for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. If confirmed, she would be that court’s first openly homosexual judge. Adeel Mangi, nominated for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, would be the first Muslim-American circuit court judge if confirmed. Nominee Cristal Brisco would be the first black female U.S. district court judge in the Northern District of Indiana.

White House counsel Ed Siskel bragged that the nominees are “four women, two nominees from a state represented by Senate Republicans, and three historic first nominees.”

Nov 17 2023,Pro-life groups accuse abortion advocates of pushing 'dishonest' ballot proposal in Nebraska,The Christian Post,right,https://christianpost.com/news/pro-life-groups-slam-abortion-ballot-proposal-in-nebraska.html,"Home News Pro-life groups accuse abortion advocates of pushing 'dishonest' ballot proposal in Nebraska

Pro-life groups have voiced their opposition to a proposed ballot measure that would establish a constitutional right to abortion in Nebraska, calling it a ""dishonest"" source of ""confusion"" that ""endangers pregnant women.""

On Wednesday, language for a proposed constitutional amendment that would establish a right to abortion in Nebraska became public.

The amendment would create ""a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability,"" a point it defines as ""the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the patient's treating health care practitioner, there is a significant likelihood of the fetus's sustained survival outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.""

The Nebraska-based pro-choice coalition Protect Our Rights is working to collect the required signatures for the proposed amendment to make the ballot in time for next year's general election.

Coalition members include the ACLU of Nebraska, I Be Black Girl, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska, the Women's Fund of Omaha and Nebraska Appleseed.

The proposal would enable women to obtain abortions after the point of viability ""when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, without interference from the state or its political subdivisions."" If approved, it would have the effect of nullifying the current Nebraska abortion law, which bans abortions after 12 weeks gestation.

""There are many reasons why someone may make the deeply personal decision to have an abortion,"" the coalition insists on its webpage. ""Most Nebraskans agree that the government should not be involved in personal decisions that are better left to patients, their faith, and their health care providers. Nebraskans deserve the right to make their own decisions about pregnancy and abortion.""

The pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America contends the developments in Nebraska are part of a ""nationally coordinated effort by the abortion industry and their allies to remove all rights from the unborn, health protections for women and parental rights.""

""Nebraska's law currently allows abortion throughout the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but that isn't enough for the abortion industry and activists who are trying to write second- and third-trimester abortions into our constitution. This amendment would allow for abortion until the moment of birth,"" warned Nebraska Right to Life Executive Director Sandy Danek.

""This ballot measure is not pro-choice, it's pro-abortion, and it does not reflect the values of Nebraskans.""

Adam Schwend, western regional director for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, pushed back on some assertions made by the proposed amendment's biggest proponents.

""Right out of the gate, those behind this ballot measure are parroting the lies told by pro-abortion activists in Ohio by saying women are dying without this amendment,"" Schwend said. ""Their claim that Nebraska does not have an adequate life of the mother provision is completely dishonest.""

""The confusion they're sowing does not just deceive voters but endangers pregnant women in Nebraska who need to know that state law unequivocally allows for them to receive emergency care,"" he added.

Paige Brown, spokeswoman for the Nebraska Catholic Conference, said, ""the lie Planned Parenthood is selling that it is in a mother's best interest to end her baby's life at 12 weeks and beyond is appalling and goes against the science, which shows women are increasingly at risk for complications with abortions beyond the first trimester.""

Brown noted how, in addition to having the ability to determine the sex of the baby and whether or not the unborn child looks more like their mother or father at 12 weeks gestation, ""a baby's major organs have formed and his or her heart has beat over 10 million times.""

Nebraska Family Alliance Executive Director Karen Browning claims the proposed amendment would lead to the ""evisceration of parental rights"" and should be ""something that will concern every mom and dad in Nebraska.""

""Under this extreme amendment, a girl who is not old enough to get her ears pierced or get a tattoo on her own will be able to obtain an abortion without a parent ever knowing,"" she said. ""Women and children deserve real compassionate care, not lies from the abortion industry.""

Last week, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment establishing a right to abortion in the state constitution. Ohio voters approved Issue 1 in a 57%-43% vote last week, making it the first state that supported Republican Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election to enact a right to abortion.

If approved, Nebraska would become the most Republican-leaning state to have a constitutional right to abortion. While neighboring Kansas voted against a ""Value Them Both"" amendment that would have removed the right to abortion from the state constitution, voters never approved establishing a right to abortion in the first place. The Kansas Supreme Court determined that the state constitution contains a right to abortion in a 2019 decision.

Other states where voters have approved amending the constitution to include a right to abortion voted for President Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election: California, Michigan and Vermont.

Pro-abortion advocates have a long way to go until they find out if proposed amendment will make it onto Nebraska's general election ballot in the 2024 election.

According to Ballotpedia, which keeps track of requirements for citizen-initiated referendums in the states that allow them, the number of required signatures in Nebraska is ""tied to the number of registered voters in the state as of the deadline for filing signatures.""

This means petitioners won't know how many signatures are required until signatures are submitted for verification.

Advocates have until July 5 to submit the required number of supporting signatures, which must add up to at least 10% of the state's total number of registered voters.

The Lincoln Journal Star estimates it will take at least 122,000 signatures to ensure that the pro-abortion ballot measure can appear before voters next year. The outlet clarified that state law requires those spearheading ballot measures to collect signatures from at least 5% of registered voters in at least 38 of Nebraska's 93 counties.

Nebraska is one of 25 states that have implemented pro-life protections in some form since the U.S. Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which determined that the U.S. Constitution does not contain a right to abortion.

In a phone call with members of the media last month, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America identified Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota as other states where pro-abortion advocates are working to put ballot questions that would establish a right to abortion before voters."
Nov 08 2023,"Ohio’s Black Voters Credited For Protecting Abortion Access, Legalizing Recreational Marijuana",News One,left,https://newsone.com/4788950/ohio-election-black-voters-credited,"A grassroots political organization in Ohio has credited Black voters in particular for Tuesday night’s election results that included protecting in-state access to abortions and legalizing recreational marijuana.

The Ohio Organizing Collaborative (OOC) said the victories demonstrate how such successful mobilization of voters – particularly Black voters – can be used as a model for other states where ballot measures on politically charged issues such as abortion and marijuana legalization could be realized.

MORE: Black Candidates Make History As Democrats Win Big On Election Night

The group spoke out in the hours after Ohio voters made their voices heard at the ballot box in a resounding fashion. Ohio was the only state this year to have a ballot question about abortion along with becoming the 24th state to legalize recreational marijuana use for adults.

“We are finding the voters that no one else is looking for, including Black people, young people, and returning citizens who have been left out of the process,” Prentiss J. Haney, Co-Executive Director of OOC, said in a statement sent to NewsOne. “If you do the work to understand Black voters and create ways for them to feel and exercise their power together, you can confront rightful cynicism, feelings that nothing will change, and low voter turnout.”

According to exit polling data provided by NBC News, the ballot measure on abortion in Ohio was supported by 83% of Black voters. The ballot measure for legalizing recreational marijuana in Ohio was supported by 72% of Black voters. The two sets of numbers were the highest rates for voters of any background for both ballot measures.

The results of the abortion ballot measure were expected to be critical for Black women, advocates said.

“Unlike any other place we’ve seen so far, anti-abortion groups have invested big in misinforming Black Ohioans, in particular,” Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, recently told the Grio.

OOC published research that it used for the “pilot program” in Ohio about understanding and engaging voters, including outreach efforts to people like the formerly incarcerated that it said generated tangible results.

“Black voters who OOC engaged turned out at a higher rate than voters the organization did not reach,” OOC said in a press release, noting that “there was a 9% increase of early voters in 2023 compared to 2022.”

Haney said that shows how “[w]hen elections are decided on the margins, it’s people living on the margins who make the difference.”

OOC said it expects to have other “Black-led power building groups in additional states, including Detroit Action in Michigan, POWER Interfaith in Pennsylvania, and New Georgia Project,” apply the model used in Ohio.

The Associated Press reported that the approval of the constitutional amendment for abortion in Ohio may bode well for Democrats in 2024, especially in the presidential election:

The outcome of the intense, off-year election could be a bellwether for 2024, when Democrats hope the issue will energize their voters and help President Joe Biden keep the White House. Voters in Arizona, Missouri and elsewhere are expected to vote on similar protections next year.

The same could be true for future recreational marijuana legalization ballot measures, which next year will include Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, among other states.

Nov 08 2023,Grappling with Trump and abortion losses: Six key takeaways from the Republican debate,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/grappling-trump-abortion-losses-six-key-takeaways-republican-debate-rcna121833,"On his home turf at the Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sharpened his case against front-runner Donald Trump and tussled with former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley as she looked to build on her momentum.

Five candidates met on stage Wednesday night, just over two months before voting begins: DeSantis, Haley, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Absent for the third time was Trump, the former president who is dominating the GOP polls so far — and continued his debate counterprogramming tradition with a rally in nearby Hialeah.

While DeSantis and Haley are competing for second place and a shot at being the main GOP alternative to Trump, the other three are fighting to keep their candidacies alive.

Here are some key takeaways from the debate.

'I'm sick of Republican losing': DeSantis and Co. sharpen their attacks on Trump

DeSantis used the first question to get right into his case against Trump before a larger audience, rattling off a litany of what he called Trump's failures as president — and blaming him for a poor election night for the GOP on Tuesday.

“Donald Trump’s a lot different guy than he was in 2016. He owes it to you to be on this stage and explain why he should get another chance,"" DeSantis said. ""He should explain why we didn’t have Mexico pay for the border wall. He should explain why he racked up so much debt. He should explain why he didn’t drain the swamp. And he said Republicans were gonna get tired of winning — what we saw last night, I’m sick of Republicans losing.”

Haley, who worked in Trump's administration as ambassador to the United Nations, said Trump ""was the right president at the right time; I don’t think he’s the right president now.”

Christie chimed in: “I’ll say this about Donald Trump: Anybody who’s going to be spending the next year and a half of their life focusing on keeping themselves out of jail and courtrooms cannot lead this party or this country.”

Ramaswamy goes negative and gets personal with Haley

Ramaswamy began throwing elbows at his first opportunity. He complained that NBC News was hosting the debate and that ""Meet the Press"" moderator Kristen Welker was asking questions. He tore into Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel and blamed her for the GOP getting ""trounced"" in Tuesday's elections and other elections since 2016 — conveniently leaving out that that timeline coincides with Trump's rise.

Ramaswamy then knocked Haley as “Dick Cheney in 3-inch heels,” which drew some jeers and oohs from the crowd.

Haley brushed him off: ""They're 5-inch heels, and I don't wear them unless you can run in them,"" she said. She added: ""They're not a fashion statement. They're for ammunition."" Then she moved on.

Later, Ramaswamy attacked DeSantis and Haley for backing what he called ""censorship"" of student groups during a discussion about antisemitism on college campuses.

And he mentioned Haley when discussing Ukraine: ""I’m actually enjoying watching the Ukraine hawks quietly, elegantly tiptoe back from their position as this thing has unwound into a disaster.""

Then Ramaswamy again took unprompted aim at Haley in the second hour of the debate, noting that her daughter was on TikTok. Haley responded: “Leave my daughter out of your voice.”

“You’re just scum,” she told him.

GOP candidates grapple with the party's position on abortion

Asked about another defeat for abortion foes in Ohio on Tuesday, DeSantis emphasized his support for “a culture of life” and said that different states can set their own abortion laws. He signed a ban on abortion after six weeks in Florida.

“All this stuff that’s happened to the pro-life cause, they have been caught flat-footed on these referenda. And they have been losing,” he said, lamenting that conservatives are losing voters who support Republican candidates but also support abortion-rights measures.

Scott, meanwhile, called for a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks: “I would challenge Nikki and Ron to join me at a 15-week limit.”

That's the same length as the state-level policy that Virginia Republicans campaigned on this year, but they lost both houses of the state Legislature on Tuesday.

Haley said Republicans won’t find the votes to “ban abortions” at the federal level. When pressed on whether she’d enact a 15-week abortion ban, she said: “I would support anything that would pass.”

Haley seeks to show her foreign policy chops

Haley, responding to one of many broadsides from Ramaswamy, said: ""I’m telling you, Putin and President Xi are salivating at the thought that someone like that could become president. They would love that.""

He sought to interrupt her, but she made her case for protecting Ukraine and bolstering international partnerships, arguing that a network of foreign foes would exploit weakness creeping into the nation's commitment to its alliances.

""America can never be so arrogant to think we don’t need friends after 9/11. We need a lot of friends,"" Haley said. ""This unholy alliance between Russia, Ukraine and China is real. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to support the Ukrainians; it’s because they know that China’s coming after them next. There is a reason Ukrainians want us to support Israelis because they know that if Iran wins, Russia wins.""

Haley took multiple opportunities during the debate to promote her belief in an aggressive U.S. role in shaping global affairs. And she seemed to delight in smacking down Ramaswamy by associating him with Putin and Xi.

DeSantis and Haley clash over China and climate

The two highest-polling candidates on stage tussled over the biggest foreign policy concern in Washington: China. But the attacks largely pointed back to development in their own states, as opposed to disagreements over future foreign policy.

Haley took aim at DeSantis when discussing her plan to confront China economically. “We will go and end all formal trade relations with China until they stop murdering Americans from fentanyl, something Ron has yet to say that he’s going to do,” she said.

DeSantis hit back: “Ambassador Haley said somehow I wasn’t doing — she welcomed them into South Carolina, and gave them land near a military base, wrote the Chinese ambassador a love letter saying what a great friend they were.” He said that in Florida, “I banned China from buying land in this state.”

Haley came back at the Florida governor: ""Yes, I brought a fiberglass company 10 years ago to South Carolina. But Ron, you are the chair of your economic development agency that as of last week said Florida is the ideal place for Chinese businesses.""

Later, Haley took aim at DeSantis from the right on environmental policy. ""He has opposed fracking, he's opposed drilling,"" Haley said. She called him ""a liberal when it comes to the environment,"" bringing up an argument she litigated at a previous debate, too.

DeSantis responded: ""We are absolutely going to frack. But I disagree with Nikki Haley: I don't think it's a good idea to drill in the Florida Everglades, and I know most Floridians agree with me.""

A split on Medicare and Social Security

The candidates were split on whether to cut retirement benefits going forward.

Haley called for slashing long-term spending on Medicare and Social Security, calling for a higher retirement age, a slower rate of benefit growth and curtailing benefits to wealthy Americans.

“Any candidate that tells you that they’re not going to take on entitlements is not being serious. Social Security will go bankrupt in 10 years. Medicare will go bankrupt in eight. Right now, you have Ron and Trump joining Biden and Pelosi saying they’re not going to change or do any sort of entitlement reform,"" she said.

DeSantis sidestepped the question by declining to endorse specific changes to Social Security or Medicare, calling for lowering inflation and boosting economic growth. He said life expectancy has declined in some recent years, so pegging benefits to that wouldn't cut them.

""To seniors in America: Promise made, promise kept,"" he said."
Sep 29 2023,Federal Court ruling limits access to abortion in Idaho,KIVI 6,center,https://kivitv.com/news/federal-court-ruling-limits-access-to-abortion-in-idaho,"There is a new development in the fight over abortion access in Idaho.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has reversed an injunction by a federal judge in Idaho that previously protected Emergency Room doctors from facing charges for performing abortions under a federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA).

The federal act impacts healthcare facilities that receive Medicare funding, guaranteeing stabilizing health care to all patients seeking emergency treatment, including pregnant women.

The Department of Justice had previously argued that Idaho's state abortion law violated EMTALA, saying the state's ban on abortion put healthcare workers in the impossible situation of facing criminal charges for treating their patients.

The ruling means Emergency Room physicians can now be prosecuted if they perform an abortion to stabilize a patient unless they explicitly qualify for the law's written exception acting to ""prevent the death of a pregnant woman"".

Planned Parenthood reacted in a statement saying in part:"
Nov 07 2023,"Ohio voters will approve enshrining abortion rights in state constitution, CNN projects",CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/ohio-issue-1-abortion-rights/index.html,"CNN —

Ohio will become the latest state to enshrine reproductive rights in its state constitution, CNN projects, continuing a winning trend for abortion rights advocates since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

With the passage of the ballot measure Issue 1, Ohio will be prevented from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors believe to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state can restrict abortion access unless the patient’s life or health are at risk.

The vote is yet another sign that abortion access is a key issue for voters across party lines, even in a state like Ohio, which has trended Republican in recent elections.

“Abortion access isn’t just a winning issue with voters; it’s a fundamental right that impacts every aspect of their lives,” Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion rights group, said in a statement. “Ohioans have now constitutionally guaranteed this right, and the nation is watching.”

It’s also a blow to state and national abortion opponents, who had hoped that their investment in the odd-year election would help turn the tide after losing a half-dozen abortion-related ballot initiatives in 2022.

Abortion opponents in Ohio vowed to keep fighting following Tuesday’s result. They attributed their loss to millions in outside money that flowed into the state and the ad campaign run by proponents of Issue 1. Though abortion opponents were outraised, both sides received help from around the country.

“We stand ready during this unthinkable time to advocate for women and the unborn, just as we have always done,” Protect Women Ohio, the main group working to oppose the ballot initiative, said in a statement. “We persevered for 50 years to overturn Roe v Wade. Ours is a movement that has always endured, and always will.”

At the center of the debate over Issue 1 was Ohio’s six-week abortion ban, which was blocked by a court last year but is being considered by the state Supreme Court. Abortion rights advocates argued that the only way to stop the law, which has no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, was to pass Issue 1.

In contrast, abortion opponents argued that the measure went too far and would prevent the state from enacting a consensus bill with exceptions. Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who signed the six-week ban into law, campaigned heavily against Issue 1 and shot an ad urging Ohioans to vote “no.”

In August, Ohio voters defeated a measure that would have raised the threshold for passage of ballot initiatives to change the state constitution from a simple majority to 60%. The measure was viewed as an attempt to block the abortion rights amendment, and its failure was seen as a sign that the fall amendment would pass.

According to preliminary results of CNN’s Ohio exit poll, roughly 6 in 10 voters who turned out for Tuesday’s election expressed negative feelings about the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. About 3 in 10 said abortion should be legal in all cases and about a third said that it should be legal in most cases.

Nov 07 2023,"Ohio votes to legalize marijuana for adult recreational use, passes abortion measure",Indianapolis Business Journal,center,https://ibj.com/articles/ohio-votes-to-legalize-marijuana-for-adult-recreational-use-passes-abortion-measure,"Ohio voters approved a measure legalizing recreational marijuana on Tuesday, defying Republican legislative leaders who had failed to pass the proposed law.

Passage of Issue 2 makes Ohio the 24th state to allow adult cannabis use for non-medical purposes. About 56% of voters were supporting the measure with most of the vote counted.

Voters in the state also approved a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care.

Marijuana measure

“Marijuana is no longer a controversial issue,” said Tom Haren, spokesman for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. “Ohioans demonstrated this by passing State Issue 2 in a landslide. Ohioans are being extremely clear on the future they want for our state: adult-use marijuana legal and regulated.”

The new law will allow adults 21 and over to buy and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis and to grow plants at home. A 10% tax will be imposed on purchases, to be spent on administrative costs, addiction treatment, municipalities with dispensaries and social equity and jobs programs supporting the industry itself.

Ohio will be the fourth largest state with a recreational pot market, with sales predicted to reach $4 billion by the fourth year after its launch. The decision will likely put pressure on neighboring states including Indiana.

The election’s outcome represents a blow to GOP lawmakers, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine and business and manufacturing organizations concerned about its impact on workplace and traffic safety.

But as a citizen-initiated statute, the law is subject to change. Republicans who remain opposed to it in the Legislature are free to make tweaks to the law — or even repeal it, though the political stakes are higher now that the voters have approved it.

Among concerns raised by opponents that lawmakers may revisit is the measure’s tax structure, which earmarks none of the earnings for Ohio counties that administer social services programs directed at drug use, addiction and other issues that could rise due to Issue 2’s passage.

“This fight is not over,” Smart Approaches to Marijuana Action President Kevin Sabet said in a statement. He called on state lawmakers to eliminate provisions of Issue 2 that allow for commercial sales, advertising and production, at a minimum.

For the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, voter approval marked the culmination of the proposal’s yearslong fight to become law.

GOP Secretary of State Frank LaRose first submitted petitions to the Ohio General Assembly on behalf of the coalition in January 2022, triggering a four-month countdown for lawmakers to act. Republican legislative leaders didn’t, and lawmakers asserted the group’s petitions arrived too late for 2022 ballots.

A lawsuit and settlement ensued, under which the group agreed to wait until this year.

Abortion amendment

Ohio’s decision was the latest victory for abortion rights supporters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. About 58% of voters approved the measure.

Ohio became the seventh state where voters decided to protect abortion access after the landmark ruling and was the only state to consider a statewide abortion rights question this year.

“The future is bright, and tonight we can celebrate this win for bodily autonomy and reproductive rights,” Lauren Blauvelt, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, which led support for the amendment, told a jubilant crowd of supporters.

The outcome of the intense, off-year election could be a bellwether for 2024, when Democrats hope the issue will energize their voters and help President Joe Biden keep the White House. Voters in Arizona, Missouri and elsewhere are expected to vote on similar protections next year.

Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to state legislatures, said the vote in favor of abortion rights was a “huge victory.”

“Ohio’s resounding support for this constitutional amendment reaffirms Democratic priorities and sends a strong message to the state GOP that reproductive rights are non-negotiable,” she said in a statement.

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris issued statements celebrating the amendment’s win, emphasizing that attempts to ban or severely restrict abortion represent a minority view across the country. Harris hinted at how the issue would likely be central to Democrats’ campaigning next year for Congress and the presidency, saying “extremists are pushing for a national abortion ban that would criminalize reproductive health care in every single state in our nation.”

Ohio’s constitutional amendment, on the ballot as Issue 1, included some of the most protective language for abortion access of any statewide ballot initiative since the Supreme Court’s ruling. Opponents had argued that the amendment would threaten parental rights, allow unrestricted gender surgeries for minors and revive “partial birth” abortions, which are federally banned.

Public polling shows about two-thirds of Americans say abortion should generally be legal in the earliest stages of pregnancy, a sentiment that has been underscored in both Democratic and deeply Republican states since the justices overturned Roe in June 2022.

Before the Ohio vote, statewide initiatives in California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont had either affirmed abortion access or turned back attempts to undermine the right."

Sep 28 2023,Woman to Be Sentenced for Burning Down Wyoming Abortion Clinic,The Epoch Times,right,https://theepochtimes.com/us/woman-to-be-sentenced-for-burning-down-wyoming-abortion-clinic-5500367,"Lorna Green said she opposed abortion but expressed regret for setting fire to the abortion clinic, which also offers ‘gender-affirming care.’

A Wyoming woman who set fire to a brand new abortion clinic in Casper that would also offer “gender-affirming care” will be sentenced on Thursday, facing up to 20 years in prison.

At a hearing in July, Lorna Roxanne Green admitted to federal arson, expressed regret, and told U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson that she “knew right after” that it was wrong.

She was remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service following her July 20 court appearance.

Ms. Green said she was driven by anxiety and nightmares to set fire to the Wellspring Health Access facility, Wyoming’s only clinic that offers both surgical and pill abortions, as well as transgender treatments.

She purchased gas cans and aluminum pans to contain the combustible liquid the day before she drove to Casper, she told a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent.

According to court documents, Ms. Green admitted to using a rock to break glass in a door to enter the clinic, and poured gasoline into the aluminum pans in a number of rooms and on the floor, before lighting it on fire.

Security video and a witness account matched Ms. Green’s account of how she carried the gas cans and aluminum pans to the clinic in a bag, according to a court filing.

She told investigators that she opposed abortion.

The fire occurred weeks before the clinic was to open. The building required extensive remodeling, which set the clinic’s opening back by almost a year.

Ms. Green was arrested on March 21 and then indicted by a federal grand jury in May, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Wyoming.

Authorities were finally able to identify Ms. Green with the help of tipsters after increasing a reward to $15,000 in March.

The Wellspring Health Access opened in April, providing surgical and pill abortions. Wyoming’s only other abortion clinic, in Jackson, provides abortion pills only.

The state legislature passed laws restricting pill abortions in 2022 and 2020, however, in June a judge halted the ban while a legal challenge plays out. As a result, the pill, known as mifepristone, will remain accessible to women for now while the legal challenge unfolds.

Wyoming is the only state that has specifically prohibited abortion pills, whereas other Republican-led states have included medication abortions in their broader abortion restrictions.

Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens, who was appointed by the state’s Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, ruled that the attorneys representing Wyoming failed to demonstrate that the ban would not harm the plaintiffs before their lawsuit was resolved.

The Wellspring Health Access is a party to the legal challenge, that was also filed collectively by four women, two obstetricians, and one other nonprofit organization.

The case revolves around a state constitutional amendment enacted in 2012, which was a response to the Affordable Care Act—also known as Obamacare—which states that Wyoming residents have the right to make their own health care decisions. Judge Owens was sympathetic to this argument.

However, Wyoming State’s Attorney Jay Jerde argued that the amendment did not extend to abortions for reasons other than health care. He contended that abortion doesn’t fall within the scope of restoring a woman’s body from pain, injury, or physical sickness.

“Medical services are involved, but getting an abortion for reasons other than health care, it can’t be a medical decision,” Jerde argued in court.

However, Judge Owens disagreed, saying that pregnancy itself involves pain and sickness. While Mr. Jerde charged that this is not why women seek abortions.

In March, Wyoming enacted a complete abortion ban, with exceptions for cases where a life is in danger or for instances of rape or incest that are reported to the police. However, this ban is not enforceable while the legal challenge unfolds. Currently, abortions are legal in the state up until the unborn child is viable at around 24 to 26 weeks.

In April, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that mifepristone, the abortion pill, would be widely accessible while an ongoing legal battle over its regulatory approval continues. The Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000. It is used in combination with another drug called misoprostol to terminate pregnancies of up to 10 weeks.

The pill is also sometimes used for women experiencing miscarriages. Medication abortions, also known as chemical abortions, account for more than half of all abortions in the United States.

Dec 07 2023,Texas judge to allow emergency abortion in first case of its kind since before Roe v. Wade,Austin American-Statesman,center,https://statesman.com/story/news/politics/state/2023/12/07/texas-abortion-emergency-granted-dallas-mom-kate-cox-travis-county-judge-maya-guerra-gamble/71837958007,"A Travis County state judge on Thursday authorized a woman in Texas to obtain an emergency medically indicated abortion, marking the first such intervention in the state since before Roe v. Wade was decided 50 years ago.

After that landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that guaranteed a federal right to an abortion was overturned in 2022, Texas instituted a near-total abortion ban, with only a few exceptions including life-threatening complications for the mother.

The Center for Reproductive Rights filed the case Tuesday on behalf of Kate Cox, her husband and her OB-GYN. Cox is 20 weeks pregnant, and her fetus has trisomy 18, a deadly genetic condition. The Dallas-area mother of two has been admitted to emergency rooms four times in the past month — including one visit since the case was filed — after experiencing severe cramping and fluid leaks, attorney Molly Duane told the court Thursday.

Several doctors have advised Cox that there is ""virtually no chance"" her baby will survive and that carrying the pregnancy to term would make it less likely that she will be able to carry another child in the future, according to the complaint. Cox's pregnancy puts her health and fertility at risk for such problems as including gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes, uterine rupture from Caesarean section and post-operative infections, the complaint states.

More than 95% of fetuses with trisomy 18 do not survive to birth, or if they do, are likely to die within minutes or hours, according to the Cleveland Clinic.

On Thursday morning, two days after Cox's case was filed, Travis County state District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble signed a temporary restraining order preventing the state, Attorney General Ken Paxton and the Texas Medical Board from enforcing the state's abortion bans against Cox, her husband or her OB-GYN Dr. Damla Karsan.

""The idea that Ms. Cox wants desperately to be a parent and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking, and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,"" said Gamble, a Democrat, as she delivered her ruling.

Cox, who was onscreen next to her husband in the court hearing streamed online via Zoom, began to cry when she heard Gamble's ruling.

""Every day of this ordeal has been agonizing for (Kate), and today she finally got recognition that she has a right to the health care she needs,"" Duane, Cox's attorney, told reporters in a call Thursday afternoon. ""What is happening in Texas right now is a human rights violation, and I ask you to think about all of the people in Texas who need an abortion right now — for reasons that are wholly their own — who cannot drop everything to file a lawsuit.""

The state cannot appeal a temporary restraining order and would instead have to file a writ of mandamus to petition a higher court to block the order, Southern Methodist University law professor Joanna Grossman told the American-Statesman. Cox obtaining the abortion beforehand would render such a case moot, she said. Paxton has not yet announced if he will file a writ of mandamus petition and has not responded to the Statesman's requests for comment.

During the hearing, attorney Johnathan Stone, who is representing the state, argued that state laws are clear and that Dr. Ingrid Skop, an anti-abortion OB-GYN, reviewed the facts as outlined in Cox's petition and did not find evidence that Cox's situation qualifies her for a medical exception. Granting her permission to terminate her pregnancy, Stone claimed, would change the law's meaning.

""If you sign the TRO order as written, you will be effectively saying that the standard in Texas is not reasonable medical judgment,"" Stone said in the hearing. ""Instead, it's a subjective standard, and it's simply a good faith belief. You'd be both be changing the standard for the medical exemption in Texas, and then finding that the plaintiffs ... qualify for that.""

The temporary restraining order in this case only applies to Cox's particular situation, meaning it doesn't establish the kind of broad precedent to which Stone refers, Grossman said. But it may serve as a model.

""I think it's good for people to understand that there are lawyers being very creative and looking at every single option,"" Grossman said. ""This is another example of how people might get help if they're in this situation, but it's also a reminder of just how much the law is in flux.""

The question of how medical exceptions to Texas' abortion ban can be interpreted and applied in cases of pregnancy complications is at the heart of Zurawski v. Texas, a suit brought by 20 Texas women who were denied abortions, many of them experiencing pregnancy complications like in Cox's case.

That suit, filed in March, alleges that vague language and “non-medical terminology” in state laws leave doctors unable or unwilling to administer abortion care, forcing patients to seek treatment out of state or to wait until after their lives are in danger. Karsan, Cox's physician, is also a plaintiff in Zurawski v. Texas, and Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Molly Duane represents plaintiffs in both cases.

The Texas Supreme Court on Nov. 28 heard Zurawski v. Texas, exactly one week before Cox filed her suit. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in June.

Nov 07 2023,BREAKING: Ohio votes to enshrine abortion up until birth in its constitution,The Post Millennial,right,https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-ohio-votes-to-enshrine-abortion-up-until-birth-in-its-constitution,"Voters in Ohio have approved a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights into the state's constitution, the Associated Press reported Tuesday night.State Republicans argued the measure went ""too far"" and even further than Roe v. Wade. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine told Fox News in October, ""It's pretty clear that this constitutional amendment just goes farther, much further than what the average Ohioan approves.”Dewine added, ""If a voter is comfortable with abortion up until the time of birth, they're probably going to be okay with this amendment — if they're comfortable with parents not being involved in the most important decision their daughter will ever make or certainly has made up until that point in her life. If they're okay with that, then they should vote for this.""He also told Fox News Sunday, “If you look at Issue 1, it’s a radical proposal, and whether you’re pro-choice or pro-life, it just goes much, much too far. It would enshrine in our Constitution the right to have an abortion up until birth, any time during the pregnancy. Second thing it would do is threaten a law we had on the books for many years requiring parental consent if we’re dealing with a minor.

It is a radical proposal that does not fit Ohio.”The ACLU spent tens of millions of dollars on the race in a state that former President Donald Trump won by 8 points in 2020.

Sep 28 2023,Judge delays enforcement of abortion clinic license requirement,KTVQ 2,center,https://ktvq.com/news/judge-delays-enforcement-of-abortion-clinic-license-requirement,"HELENA — A district court judge in Helena has agreed to delay a provision in a new state law that would require abortion clinics to be licensed by the state. The provision was set to take effect this Sunday, Oct. 1.

District Judge Chris Abbott granted a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of one section of House Bill 937.

HB 937 says no one can operate an abortion clinic without applying for and receiving a license from the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. It also directs DPHHS to establish rules for operating a clinic – including things like staff qualifications, required equipment, the “architecture or layout of an abortion clinic,” and a requirement for regular inspections.

However, DPHHS has not yet come out with those rules, leaving clinics with no way of getting a license before the law takes effect.

Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula and All Families Healthcare in Whitefish sued over the law, claiming the restrictions were unnecessary and unfairly targeted abortion providers, as other private health care practices don’t have to follow them. They said, without clear guidance from the state, they would be in a state of legal uncertainty after Oct. 1 – not knowing whether they could continue to perform abortions.

In his ruling, Abbott said DPHHS had acknowledge it’s difficult to enforce the law until the rules are in place. However, he said that there hadn’t been a specific declaration that the state would not enforce it, and that county attorneys might still attempt to prosecute clinics. He said it was justifiable to put in a limited restraining order, allowing the state to continue the rulemaking process, but addressing the clinics’ concerns until a full hearing can be held. He set a hearing for Oct. 30 on whether a preliminary injunction should be granted.

Abbott said this initial ruling was not intended to address the question of whether the state has a compelling interest in licensing abortion clinics."
Aug 14 2023,Campaign: RFK 'Misunderstood' Abortion Question,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/rfk-abortion-stance-2024/2023/08/14/id/1130690,"The campaign of Democrat presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has walked back his comments suggesting he would support a federal abortion ban after three months of pregnancy.

At the Iowa State Fair on Sunday, Kennedy told a reporter that women should have the right to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. After that, ""the state has an interest"" in deciding if abortions should be restricted, he said.

His response indicated he would support a federal ban on abortion after the first three months.

Kennedy's campaign quickly issued a statement on kennedy24.com to clarify his position.

""Today, Mr. Kennedy misunderstood a question posed to him by an NBC reporter in a crowded, noisy exhibit hall at the Iowa State Fair,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Kennedy's position on abortion is that it is always the woman's right to choose. He does not support legislation banning abortion.""

Earlier at the fair, Kennedy told an NBC News reporter: ""Once a child is viable outside the womb, I think then the state has an interest in protecting the child,"" he said, adding that he was for ""medical freedom"" in general.

""Individuals are able to make their own choices,"" he said.

Asked specifically if he would sign a three-month federal abortion ban, Kennedy said: ""Yes, I would.""

Some prominent pro-life groups were fast to praise Kennedy for his comments. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America extolled the candidate for driving such a ""stark contrast to the Democratic Party's radical stance.""

Writer-speaker Marianne Williamson and Kennedy are the only candidates who have entered the Democrat presidential nomination race against President Joe Biden.

Kennedy has upset many members of the Democratic Party, as well as family members, with his views on vaccines. He also criticized the Biden administration after announcing it would transfer cluster munitions to Ukraine, reversing a previous decision to withhold them.

On social media last month, Kennedy said that despite the 1968 assassination of his father, Robert F. Kennedy, leading to the Secret Service protecting presidential candidates, that agency denied him that very protection."
Nov 07 2023,Exit poll: Most Ohio voters still large favor legal abortion,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/11/07/politics/exit-polls-election-2023/index.html,"CNN —

An electorate driven by continued discontent at the overturn of Roe v. Wade last year turned out to help enshrine reproductive rights into Ohio’s state constitution, according to the initial results of CNN’s Ohio exit poll.

CNN projects that the ballot measure Issue 1 will pass, preventing the Buckeye State from restricting abortion access before fetal viability, which doctors believe to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. After viability, the state would be able to restrict abortion access, unless the patient’s life or health are at risk.

A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, voters in Ohio who turned out for Tuesday’s election are still feeling the sting.

Roughly 6 in 10 expressed negative feelings about the court’s decision, including about 4 in 10 who called themselves outright angry about it – nearly identical to the sentiments among midterm voters in Ohio last year. By contrast, fewer than 20% of Ohio voters this year said they were enthusiastic about the 2022 decision.

Amid that political environment, support for Issue 1 (indicated with a “yes” vote) was nearly universal among Democrats and self-described liberal voters, with nearly 70% of self-described moderates and more than 6 in 10 political independents who voted also backing the initiative. They were joined by a significant minority of Republicans, with nearly 1 in 5 GOP voters backing “yes.” Nearly 6 in 10 parents of children under 18 voted in support of the abortion rights initiative, as did a slim majority of suburban women.

Ohio voters younger than 30 were at least as much of a presence in this year’s election as they were in last year’s midterms. More than three-quarters of them voted “yes,” as did roughly two-thirds of those voters ages 30 to 44 and about half of those 45 and older. (Voters younger than 30 were even more broadly supportive of another Ohio ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, the exit poll finds. CNN projects that measure, Issue 2, has also passed.)

While backing for Issue 1 was somewhat broader among female than male voters, race and education also served as dividing lines. About 80% of voters of color supported the abortion rights initiative, as did about 63% of White female voters with a college degree and nearly 6 in 10 White male college graduates. By contrast, White women without college degrees were about evenly split. White men without college degrees were among the relatively few demographic groups to solidly vote “no” on the initiative.

A roughly 6 in 10 majority of Ohio voters this year said that abortion should be legal in most or all cases. About 96% who said abortion should always be legal voted to enshrine abortion rights into the constitution, while about 95% who said abortion should mostly or always be illegal voted against the initiative. Voters who said abortion should be legal in most, but not all, cases backed Issue 1 with a slightly less overwhelming majority of roughly 83%.

Notably, the Ohio electorate’s broad support for legalized abortion does not translate into similarly broad support for the Democratic Party to handle the issue. Voters trust Democrats over the GOP by only a relatively modest, single-digit margin on abortion.

By contrast, Ohio voters give the GOP the edge when it comes to which party they trust to handle the economy. Slightly less than a quarter of voters said their family’s financial situation has improved over the past three years, with about 4 in 10 saying things have worsened, and the rest that they’ve remained about the same.

Only about 4 in 10 Ohio voters approve of President Joe Biden’s job performance, similar to his standing among the electorate in the 2022 midterms. Only about a quarter of voters said they think Biden should be running for president again. But former President Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination, fares little better: Only about a third of this electorate in Ohio thinks he should be running to retake the White House. Trump carried Ohio by 8 points in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

The Ohio CNN Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and early in-person voters, along with telephone and online polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 35 Ohio polling locations among 668 Election Day voters and at a random sample of 10 early in-person voting locations, among 1,188 early in-person voters. The results also include 842 interviews with early and absentee voters conducted by phone, online or by text. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.

Dec 13 2023,Texas Republicans drove Kate Cox out of her own state. What her abortion story means for America,Salon,left,https://salon.com/2023/12/13/texas-drove-kate-cox-out-of-her-own-state-what-her-abortion-story-means-for-america,"It's impossible for any man, without the experience of pregnancy, to fully comprehend the unbearable trauma that Kate Cox just endured. At the same time, every one of us can appreciate the service she performed for America. Her suffering has viscerally exposed the harm to women and their families that has come from the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Org’n , the June 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

May we remember it next fall when we elect a president who will appoint the next Supreme Court justices. They will be people who either understand that harm or who sacrifice it on the altar of their religious beliefs and ideology.

The conflict between Cox and Texas embodies the larger battle for the soul of America.

Cox is the Texas woman who last week asked a trial court for permission to terminate her unviable pregnancy. She initially won, only to have the permission rescinded Friday by the state Supreme Court’s stay of the lower court ruling. Texas’s MAGA Attorney General Ken Paxton couldn’t wait to bring the court an emergency petition to force Cox to continue her doomed pregnancy.

Testing showed a fatal genetic abnormality in her fetus, a mutation that would kill it in utero or shortly after birth. Ms. Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, sought simply to accelerate the inevitable, avoid any threat to her health from continuing a pointless pregnancy and potentially dangerous labor, grieve and try again in the future.

We need your help to stay independent Subscribe today to support Salon's progressive journalism

Under Texas law enacted after Dobbs, however, that was not to be. Once the Texas Supreme Court issued its stay last Friday, Ms. Cox saw the handwriting on the wall. On Monday, hours before the Texas court announced its final decision permanently stopped her right to have an abortion, Ms. Cox left the state to seek medical care before her condition worsened.

Texas bans abortions after six weeks. There’s an exception for threats to the mother’s life, but not to non-terminal risks to physical or mental health from carrying a fetus that has no serious prospect for surviving.

The state tied a mother’s hopes for compassionate relief to a stake and burned them in the public square. The cruelty is shocking. Yet Cox, knowing what could be coming, stood until she saw that she might be forced – literally – to deliver.

It took undaunted courage for a woman in her straits to stick around at all, file a lawsuit and risk the emotional torture she faced last week from Texas officials and the laws enacted by them.

The conflict between Cox and Texas embodies the larger battle for the soul of America.

On one side of the battle lines is the state, which claims the right to subject its pregnant women to agony of the kind that Ms. Cox just experienced. Ultimately, she had the means to escape to another state, but millions of poor Texas women do not.

On the other side stands Cox, representing those willing to face personal peril to insist, to the point of intolerable pain, on the rights to health and bodily safety that the state should safeguard. Texas has now said it will not.

Citizens can change this in the answer we give in our votes 10 months from now. Our answer will decide not only who represents us, but also the larger question posed by Cox’s case and by political philosophers over the centuries: Can humans sustain societies in ways that benefit all, not just those with money and power who believe that the government can take away fundamental rights that existed for 50 years.

Donald Trump and his MAGA enablers are making plans if he is elected to benefit only themselves by installing the Ken Paxton’s of the country as our governing class and to destroy the constitution’s checks and balances on their power. If Trump returns to the White House, we are all Kate Cox.

In the meantime, however, she has illuminated the choice before us. Her torment by the state may sear into the public consciousness the understanding that freedom from oppressive government control is truly on the ballot in 2024.

We have already seen the redoubtable power of abortion rights in virtually every election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters have affirmed the right in seven initiative measures on the ballots of states red and blue over two election cycles. The issue has carried decisive weight in competitive candidate elections like Justice Janet Protasciewcz’s 11-point victory in Wisconsin, a state known for tight elections.

As for the coming presidential contest, the many of us who care about freedom can work to ensure the future of a republic in which the law protects individual rights. The need for a government and law of compassion can be understood by anyone, including those not built to carry a baby."
Dec 12 2023,Texas Supreme Court Officially Denies Kate Cox Emergency Abortion After Forcing Her to Travel Out of State,Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/texas-supreme-court-officially-denies-kate-cox-emergenc-1851092326,"Kate Cox filed a petition in Texas seeking emergency abortion care for her nonviable pregnancy last week. Photo:Center for Reproductive Rights

In another late night ruling, the Texas Supreme Court officially denied Kate Cox an emergency abortion on Monday evening. This ruling came just hours after Cox and her attorneys shared that she would travel out-of-state for abortion care due to the urgency of her condition. Cox, whose nonviable pregnancy threatens both her life and future fertility, received a temporary restraining order from Texas’ total abortion ban from a lower court on Thursday. But on Friday night, the state Supreme Court temporarily blocked her from receiving care until the court could issue a formal ruling.

In the Monday ruling, the Texas Supreme Court inexplicably argued that Cox’s situation didn’t rise to the level of urgency required to qualify for the abortion ban’s medical emergency exception. “Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” the opinion dismissively stated. Cox’s doctor, the opinion argues, failed to “attest to the court” that “Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.” In other words, it seems the state of Texas doesn’t believe anyone should qualify for the medical emergency exception unless they’re on the brink of death—at which point it might be too late to save them.

In a statement shared with Jezebel, Molly Duane, who represents Cox and serves as a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, argues that the state Supreme Court ruling shows that in practice, no one can get care under the state ban’s narrow, ambiguous exception for medical emergencies. “If Kate can’t get an abortion in Texas, who can? Kate’s case is proof that exceptions don’t work, and it’s dangerous to be pregnant in any state with an abortion ban,” Duane said. “No one in Texas is taking responsibility for the human suffering abortion bans are causing.”

Last week, around 20 weeks into her pregnancy, Cox filed a petition asking a judge to permit her doctor to provide her with abortion care without the threat of a $100,000 fine and life in prison—the penalties for violating Texas’ abortion ban. Per Cox’s lawsuit, her fetus has Trisomy 18, a condition that leaves the fetus with almost no chance of survival and also places Cox at risk of severe health complications, death, and infertility. “I’m trying to do what is best for my baby and myself, but the state of Texas is making us both suffer,” she said in a statement last week.

By Monday afternoon, unable to get abortion care in Texas, she was forced to leave the state. “[Cox] desperately wanted to be able to get care where she lives and recover at home surrounded by family,” Center for Reproductive Rights President Nancy Northrup said in a statement. “While Kate had the ability to leave the state, most people do not, and a situation like this could be a death sentence.”

The Texas Supreme Court is still currently considering Zurawski v. Texas, a separate suit filed by the Center on behalf of 20 women who say their lives were threatened by being denied emergency abortions. This suit asks the state to clarify the abortion ban’s medical emergency exception, which—as Cox’s case demonstrates—fails to help women in reality. “We are still awaiting a decision in Zurawski, but in the meantime, doctors still don’t know what the [medical emergency] exception means,” Duane said. “If the highest court in Texas can’t figure out what this law means, I’m not sure how a doctor could. Meanwhile, the lives of Texans hang in the balance.”"
Oct 26 2023,Judge dismisses Satanic Temple lawsuit that challenged Indiana abortion ban,Fox 59,center,https://fox59.com/indiana-news/judge-dismisses-satanic-temple-lawsuit-that-challenged-indiana-abortion-ban,"INDIANAPOLIS — A judge has dismissed the Satanic Temple’s lawsuit which challenged Indiana’s near-total abortion ban by claiming the restrictive law infringed on their followers’ religious rights.

A judge with the United States District Court of the Southern District of Indiana didn’t weigh in on the matter of whether the abortion ban’s creation or enforcement lies in the muddled grounds of infringement of religious beliefs or even separation of church and state. The judge’s dismissal, instead, rested squarely on the decision that the Satanic Temple’s lawsuit had no ground to stand on due to the temple operating no abortion clinics in Indiana and failing to disclose specific members who are being affected by the ban.

“(The Satanic Temple) operates no ‘licensed… abortion clinic in Indiana,’ employs no ‘physicians who are licensed to practice medicine in Indiana’ and provides no ‘in-person services to patients’ in Indiana,” Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson wrote in her decision.

The judge also stated that the Satanic Temple also has no plans to create a clinic in Indiana and “‘does not presently intend’ to seek a license for an abortion clinic in Indiana.”

In the Satanic Temple’s Tenents, the right to abortion is paramount in its belief that “one’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.” The temple operates an abortion clinic out of New Mexico which helps members across the country have access to abortion by providing abortion medication through the mail.

While the Satanic Temple has no plans to create a physical clinic in Indiana, the temple argued it still had a right to assist its Indiana members by providing abortions as needed, in accordance with their religious beliefs, via their mailing operation. But the judge pointed out that this abortion pill via mail method was prohibited under both federal and state law.

The judge also said the dismissal of the lawsuit was in part because the Satanic Temple failed to prove how the abortion ban caused injury to its Indiana members due to not specifically identifying members who are being affected.

The Satanic Temple reportedly boasts more than 90 members in Indiana but refused to identify any members specifically in the lawsuit, instead presenting them statistically. The temple stated it kept its members anonymous because “neither the Court nor the Defendants can guarantee their identity will remain secret.”

The Satanic Temple maintained its members’ secrecy citing fear of “domestic terrorists” along with potential leaks of confidential information, naming Attorney General Todd Rokita in connection with allegedly leaking confidential information in a prior abortion case.

The judge ruled, however, that without presenting specifically what members were affected the temple “failed to meet its burden to prove that there are actual or potential Indiana patients at all.”

When pressed, the Satanic Temple told the court that it could not “admit, deny nor vouch” that any Indiana member has ever received abortion-inducing drugs from the temple.

“In sum, the Satanic Temple’s allegations fail to prove it has suffered any injury in fact,” the judge concluded.

The court then ruled the Satanic Temple’s lawsuit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction without leave to amend.

“It takes a desperate and irresponsible judge to refuse to hear our case because of a baffling refusal to accept that any of our membership in Indiana may get pregnant in the future,” said Lucien Greaves, cofounder and spokesperson for the Satanic Temple.

“This was not a decision regarding the question of law we brought before the court. This is the rationalization of a judge who simply refused to do the job of hearing that case and impartially adjudicate it.”"
Nov 06 2023,Republicans test-drive post-Roe push for abortion limits in Virginia elections,Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/5/republicans-test-drive-abortion-counterpunch-virgi/,"Virginia’s legislative elections on Tuesday will test Republicans’ post-Roe push for abortion limits.

Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republicans running for seats in the state’s newly drawn legislative districts have rallied around a 15-week abortion ban to challenge Democrats’ charge that they want to outlaw the procedure altogether.

“This year’s elections in Virginia are particularly important because it is the first opportunity to see whether Republicans have an effective message with the 15-week abortion ban proposal,” said Stephen Farnsworth, director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington. “Republicans have been suffering politically ever since the Supreme Court revised Roe v. Wade, and Republicans in Virginia have largely campaigned on the 15-week ban as an alternative to being fully pro-life.

“Will that work? We will know after Tuesday,” he said. “If it does work, expect Republicans across the country next year to sound like Virginia politicians this year.”

Democrats are working overtime to make sure the Republicans’ counterpunch is another miss on abortion.

Heather Williams, interim president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, framed the election’s stakes in stark terms.

“Virginians will go to the ballot box on Tuesday and wake up Wednesday knowing whether or not their right to an abortion is protected,” Ms. Williams told The Washington Times. “It’s pretty simple.”

Mr. Youngkin, who is not up for reelection but has taken a hands-on approach to help other Republicans win control of the General Assembly, says Democrats are lying about the Republicans’ stance on abortion. He says it is Democrats who are embracing “extreme abortion policies” that are out of step with the views of most Virginians.

Mr. Youngkin has championed a 15-week abortion ban that includes exceptions for cases of rape or incest or for protecting the life of the mother.

Republican candidates in competitive races have followed the governor’s lead.

“I believe this is going to be a decision between no limits and reasonable limits, and it is one I think we will win,” Mr. Youngkin said during a recent appearance on Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle.”

Democrats’ post-Roe messaging has paid off in nationwide elections. On Tuesday, they hope it will help them defend their slim Senate majority and flip the Republican-led House of Delegates.

The abortion message is at the center of a broader warning that if Republicans capture total control of Richmond, they will target “fundamental rights” and try to restrict access to voting, ban books, prevent “common-sense” gun laws and stop people from marrying the person they love.

“Does Virginia become the next Florida and Republicans have a trifecta, or do we come into a place where Virginia has a stopgap to these really horrific Republican policies?” Ms. Williams said.

Republicans also are focusing on the economy, jobs, schools and parental empowerment.

“We have demonstrated you can reduce taxes, you can back the blue, you can support parents and put them at the head of the table, you can raise expectations in schools, and we have created 230,000 jobs in 22 months that puts us near the top of the nation, and that is what is on the ballot,” Mr. Youngkin said. “The other side, all they have to sell is fear, and we are talking about hope for the future, and hope beats fear every day of the week.”

Mr. Farnsworth said Virginia voters tend to have outsized influence on the national political conversation because of off-year elections. Also, of the states holding elections on Tuesday, Virginia is the most evenly divided between the two major political parties.

“Both parties want the bragging rights of securing wins in Virginia as a leading political indicator going into ’24,” he said. “That is why so much money is being spent in Virginia. Neither party wants to leave anything on the table.”

The election is also billed as a referendum on Mr. Youngkin’s first two years in office and a chance to elevate his national profile.

Mr. Younkin, the former head of a private equity firm, was credited with helping Republicans flip control of the House of Delegates during his rise in the 2021 election. He wants to build on that success by flipping control of the Democratic-led Senate, which thwarted parts of his legislative agenda.

Mr. Youngkin has welcomed the chance to step into the spotlight. He has emphasized early voting.

“These races are incredibly tight, and we need to get everybody out to vote,” he said. “We need to make sure Republicans get off the sidelines.”

Republicans’ most likely path to flipping control of the state Senate hinges on winning the race between Russet Perry, a Democrat, and Juan Pablo Segura, a Republican, in the 31st District, which includes parts of Loudoun and Fauquier counties.

Money has flooded into the race.

Ms. Russet, a former CIA agent, has raised more than $6 million, and Mr. Segura, the founder of a health care company and doughnut business, has pulled in $5 million, according to the Virginia Public Access Project, a nonpartisan group that tracks spending.

Republicans are also looking for a win in the newly drawn Senate District 16 in the Richmond suburbs, where Republican state Sen. Siobhan Dunnavant, a doctor, is running against state Delegate Schuyler VanValkenburg, a teacher.

“Barring some big upset elsewhere, Republicans need to win at least one of these races to win what would amount to a 20-20 Senate edge,” said J. Miles Coleman and Kyle Kondik of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “Democrats, meanwhile, have some other targets beyond these seats, but winning both would likely be sufficient for them to get to a 21-19 Senate majority even if they lose some other closely contested races elsewhere.”

They said the fate of the House would be decided in a series of races in the outer suburbs of Northern Virginia, the Richmond area and Virginia Beach.

“Tuesday’s results will show if Virginians — or at least the voters in the marginal districts — are comfortable giving his Republicans total control in an otherwise blue state,” they said. “This is ultimately impressionistic, but this year doesn’t seem to have the ‘feel’ of 2021 in Virginia when Youngkin and Republicans won the statewide offices and flipped the state House.”

Sep 07 2023,Increase in travelers to Massachusetts seeking abortion care,Science Blog,not-yet-rated,https://scienceblog.com/539540/increase-in-travelers-to-massachusetts-seeking-abortion-care,"A recent study from researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, part of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, confirms a notable increase in out-of-state residents seeking abortion care in Massachusetts.

The investigation, published in JAMA Network Open, reveals a 37 percent rise in the number of non-residents accessing abortion services in the state. Additionally, there has been an uptick in non-profit funding to cover costs for out-of-state patients.

The Dobbs v Jackson’s Women Health Organization decision in June 2022, which overturned the federal right to provide abortion care, prompted swift changes in state laws, including the implementation of 15 complete abortion bans. This led to a documented increase in travel to permissive states for abortion care, particularly from neighboring states with restrictive bans. Even prior to Dobbs, financial barriers were significant, with 60 percent of patients paying for their care out-of-pocket due to various factors, including limitations on abortion coverage in Medicaid and Medicare programs, limited private insurance coverage, and privacy concerns regarding insurance usage.

Dr. Elizabeth Janiak, corresponding author and a member of the Division of Family Planning at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, noted that interstate travelers face heightened financial stress and the stigma associated with abortion, leading many to keep their experiences private. The study aimed to comprehend how funding allocation for abortion care and travel by various non-profits and charities changed post-Dobbs, given that abortion costs can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars.

The research team conducted a retrospective review of 45,797 abortion care records spanning from January 2018 to October 2022 at the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. They then employed time series analysis, a statistical tool commonly utilized to discern trends in health service utilization, to estimate the anticipated number of abortions post-Dobbs based on pre-Dobbs data.

Dr. Janiak emphasized the robustness of their study, highlighting the extensive dataset of pre-Dobbs abortions. Rigorous statistical modeling was applied to understand the deviation in the number of abortions in the four months post-Dobbs compared to the expected counts.

Upon comparing observed and expected counts, a 6.2 percent increase in total abortions was noted. Notably, when stratified by state of residence, there was a 37.5 percent surge in the number of out-of-state residents seeking abortions, translating to approximately 45 additional procedures.

Dr. Janiak further noted a shift in the origin of abortion travelers, with individuals now coming from farther states like Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Georgia.

Post-Dobbs, there was a nearly ten percent increase in the proportion of out-of-state residents receiving abortion funding, rising from approximately 8 percent to 18 percent. Meanwhile, in-state residents’ use of funding only saw a one percent increase, from 2 percent to 3 percent, during the same period.

Dr. Janiak underlined that abortion costs already surpass the average out-of-pocket medical expenditures for reproductive age females in the U.S., and post-Dobbs, interstate travel costs are even higher.

Despite Massachusetts not sharing a border with any states with abortion bans, the study reveals a surge in patients traveling and accessing charitable funding post-Dobbs.

The study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on data from a single clinical source, potentially not fully representative of the entire state. Nevertheless, the significant increase in out-of-state residents seeking care at the largest abortion care provider in Massachusetts underscores the critical need to evaluate and fortify abortion service infrastructure in states without bans.

Dr. Janiak highlighted the pioneering nature of their analysis, particularly in a non-surge state, and outlined future research endeavors to gain a more nuanced understanding of barriers faced by individuals traveling for abortion care. Her team is conducting surveys of interstate travelers and in-state residents seeking abortion care, aiming to gather data on gestational age, pregnancy outcomes, underlying healthcare characteristics, and the psychosocial stress associated with travel for abortion, ultimately striving for greater equity in abortion care."
Nov 15 2023,"Emboldened by success in other red states, effort launched to protect abortion rights in Nebraska",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measure-nebraska-0ccae759148162706ab1e2006ecb936e,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — An effort to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution is being launched, following on the heels of successful efforts in other red states where Republicans had enacted or sought abortion restrictions.

Protect Our Rights, the coalition behind the effort, submitted proposed petition language to the Nebraska Secretary of State’s office late last month.

That language was kept under wraps until Wednesday, when the state’s top elections office released it. Organizers plan to hold a news conference Thursday to kick off the effort, in which they will need to collect around 125,000 valid signatures by next summer to get the measure on the ballot in 2024.

“We’re confident in this effort, and we’re energized,” said Ashlei Spivey, founder and executive director of I Be Black Girl, an Omaha-based reproductive rights group that makes up part of the coalition. Other members include Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Women’s Fund.

The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Under the petition language, the patient’s health care practitioner would determine fetal viability.

The group relied, in part, on polling it says shows a majority of Nebraskans favoring abortion access, Spivey said. That’s proving consistent in other states where voters have backed abortion rights — including in Ohio, where voters last week resoundingly approved an amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion access.

“Ohio was definitely a proof point for us,” Spivey said. “Ohio shows that voters are going to protect their rights.”

Now, advocates in at least a dozen states are looking to take abortion questions to voters in 2024.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes neighboring conservative Kansas, where voters resoundingly rejected last year a ballot measure that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.

Paige Brown, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Catholic Conference that has lobbied hard for abortion restrictions, telegraphed that abortion opponents are aware of the public pushback.

“Nebraska’s major pro-life groups are not pursuing our own ballot initiative,” Brown said in a written statement. Instead, she said, they will focus on defending Nebraska’s current 12-week abortion ban passed by the Republican-led Legislature earlier this year that includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.

“The vast majority of Nebraskans agree this is reasonable public policy,” Brown said.

A petition seeking a 2024 referendum to outright ban abortion in Nebraska that was approved earlier this year has been suspended after the lone organizer was unable to raise enough volunteers to circulate it.

Despite indications that further restrictions are unpopular, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and other Republican leaders have vowed to do just that, even as others have warned it could cost them elections. Republican state Sen. Merve Riepe, who tanked a 6-week ban bill by refusing to end a filibuster on it, took to the legislative floor in April to urge his conservative colleagues to heed signs that abortion will galvanize women to vote them out of office.

“We must embrace the future of reproductive rights,” he said at the time.

Ashley All, who helped lead the effort in Kansas to protect abortion rights, echoed that warning, noting Kansas voters rejected that state’s anti-abortion effort by nearly 20 percentage points.

“For 50 years, all we’ve heard is a very specific stereotype of who gets an abortion and why,” All said. “But when you start to disrupt that stereotype and show how abortion is health care, people’s perceptions and opinions begin to shift.”"

Sep 26 2023,Judge tosses ballot language that calls abortions dangerous,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/sep/26/judge-tosses-ballot-language-that-calls-abortions,"COLUMBIA, Mo. -- A Missouri judge tossed Republican-written ballot summary language Monday that described several proposed constitutional amendments as allowing ""dangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.""

Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem rewrote the ballot summary to describe the language as establishing the ""right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraception,"" as well as undoing the state's almost total ban on abortions.

In Missouri, summaries are provided to voters on ballots to help quickly explain sometimes lengthy and complicated proposals. The office of Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, which wrote the summaries, plans to appeal.

""We will not stand idly by while the courts hide the effects of this amendment and mislead the people as to what they may very well be voting on next year,"" spokesperson JoDonn Chaney said. Ashcroft is running for governor in 2024.

Missouri is among several states, including Ohio, where abortion opponents are fighting efforts to ensure or restore access to the procedure following the fall of Roe v. Wade last year.

If supporters gather enough voter signatures, the proposed constitutional amendments will go before Missouri voters in 2024.

Ashcroft's description asks voters whether they want to ""allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.""

Abortion-rights proponents sued, saying Ashcroft's summaries were misleading. Beetem agreed in his ruling Monday.

""The Court saw Ashcroft's proposed summary statements for what they were -- the language of a biased politician seeking the support of special interest groups,"" Anthony Rothert, director of integrated advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, said in a statement.

""The new summaries go a long way toward fairly describing the right to make reproductive health care decisions without government interference.""

Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said in a statement that Missouri officials ""have held hostage the right to reproductive freedom"" for decades.

Beetem also ruled Monday against abortion opponents who argued that the state auditor's cost estimates for the measures were misleadingly low because they did not account for potential losses of all Medicaid funding and property and sales tax revenue as a result of lower birth rates.

Abortion opponents did not provide any ""facts or credible legal assessment"" to support claims that the federal government will take back all of Missouri's Medicaid funding if abortion is once again legalized, and the argument to include potential loss in future taxes due to lower birth rates includes ""so many assumptions as to damage its credibility,"" Beetem ruled.

A measure to ensure abortion access is on the November ballot in Ohio after withstanding legal challenges from opponents.

That state's voters in August rejected a measure that would have required at least 60% of the vote to amend the state constitution, an approach that would have made it harder to adopt the November ballot question.

Ballot measures on abortion could also be put before voters in 2024 in Arizona, Maryland, New York and South Dakota. In Oklahoma, an initiative petition to legalize abortion was withdrawn soon after it started last year.

After the Supreme Court's ruling last year, the issue appeared on the ballot in six states. In all of them, including generally conservative Kansas and Kentucky, the abortion rights side prevailed."
Oct 25 2023,Georgia high court leaves Roe-era ban on abortions in place,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/oct/25/georgia-high-court-leaves-roe-era-ban-on,"ATLANTA -- The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a lower court ruling that the state's law restricting abortion was invalid, leaving limited access to abortions unchanged for now.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said last November that the ban was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019, when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions well past six weeks. Georgia's law bans most abortions after roughly six weeks.

The Georgia Supreme Court in a 6-1 decision said McBurney was wrong.

""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court's new interpretation of the Constitution's meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia said in a news release the opinion disregards ""long-standing precedent that a law violating either the state or federal Constitution at the time of its enactment is void from the start under the Georgia Constitution.""

The group represented doctors and advocacy groups that had asked McBurney to throw out the law.

The ruling does not change abortion access in Georgia and is not the last word on the state's ban.

The state Supreme Court had previously allowed enforcement of the ban to resume while it considered an appeal of the lower court decision. The lower court judge has also not ruled on the merits of other arguments in a lawsuit challenging the ban, including that it violates Georgia residents' rights to privacy.

In its ruling on Tuesday, the state Supreme Court sent the case back to McBurney to consider those arguments.

ABORTION TRANSPORT BAN

A Texas county near New Mexico -- where abortion is legal -- has banned helping people traveling to get an abortion in one of the newest ways of trying to restrict abortion access since the fall of Roe v. Wade.

Lubbock County is the largest of four Texas counties that have now adopted a version of the measure, which would be enforced through lawsuits filed by private citizens against people who help women obtain abortions. It is the same legal mechanism Texas used to enact a strict abortion law in 2021 before the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the state last year to ban nearly all abortions entirely.

Commissioners in the west Texas county adopted the measure 3-0 at a meeting Monday, rejecting some requests to postpone the vote.

The ordinance ""has many legal problems,"" said Lubbock County Judge Curtis Parrish, the county's top elected official. ""This ordinance, however, does not have a problem with its intent or the intent of those who are passionate about this.""

The measures expand on city ordinances rural Texas cities began passing in 2019 to ban abortion within their boundaries even if the cities did not have a clinic performing abortions. Critics have attacked the campaign as an effort to intimidate women to discourage them from seeking abortions in places where abortion remains legal.

No violations of the travel prohibition have been reported in the counties with similar measures already on the books. The measures would not punish women who are seeking the abortion but would present legal risks to people who help transport them to get the procedure.

The Lubbock County sheriff's office declined to comment on the ban or its implementation.

Lubbock County has about 317,000 residents and far outnumbers the population of the three other Texas counties -- Mitchell, Goliad and Cochran -- that have approved the ordinance in recent months, with each county's population counting fewer than 10,000 residents. Highways through Lubbock County run to New Mexico, which has some of the most permissive abortion laws in the U.S.

Nov 29 2023,Mothers and doctors challenge abortion law at Texas Supreme Court; ABC-7 examines mental health impacts,ABC 7 KVIA,center,https://kvia.com/be-mindful/2023/11/29/mothers-and-doctors-challenge-abortion-law-at-texas-supreme-court-abc-7-examines-mental-health-impacts,"EL PASO, Texas (KVIA) -- A decision in a lawsuit involving an exemption to Texas' abortion law could be coming soon -- or next summer. Oral arguments concluded yesterday in the case Zurawski v. Texas -- in which a group of mothers with extreme medical complications claim they were put in extremely dangerous situations -- because doctors were afraid to be punished for abortion procedures under state law.

The plaintiffs consist of over 19 women who experienced severe medical complications connected to childbirth. They claim that Texas laws on abortion are unclear in some areas, and as a result, medical experts are hesitant to take action -- afraid of the legal consequences. The Center for Reproductive Rights is looking gain clarity through this court case.

ABC-7's Be Mindful correspondent Avery Martinez brings us Xtra Depth on the mental health aspect of this continuing case. He is a former legal correspondent, and says oral arguments are a chance for judges to ask questions with attorneys.

Lack of clarity in Texas' law over abortion procedures is a main argument.

Under the existing language of the law, doctors could face a number of penalties for abortion procedures depending on the circumstances. The patients and doctors involved claim that fear and gray areas in the law led medical professionals to refuse emergency abortion procedures.

That in turn endangered their lives, put them in extreme distress -- and impacted their mental and physical health. A lawyer representing this group says one woman was told by her medical professionals they would not perform life-saving operations -- and advised them to go out of state.

Texas Alliance for Life, which was directly involved in the legislation around abortion laws in Texas says their stance on the law is on ethical concerns -- and worries that a special interest group is trying to circumvent legislation passed by elected representatives through the courts.

Mental health for women can be directly impacted by childbirth -- most famously through postpartum depression. It can happen to any woman -- even after a miscarriage or stillbirth. Research from the National Institutes of Health show that as many as 20% of mothers can experience postpartum symptoms.

A coalition of attorneys general -- including New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and over a dozen other states have filed briefs in the case. These attorneys say that the Texas law endanger lives and the health of pregnant women because of the extreme ban of the law.

On Tuesday, the Georgia state Supreme Court allowed the state’s six-week abortion ban to remain in place while ordering yet another trial about the constitutionality of the law by a lower trial court.

Gov. Brian Kemp—the Republican governor who ran on anti-abortion policy positions—signed the law, called the LIFE Act, in 2019, which included the six-week abortion ban (a time period when most patients don’t yet realize they’re pregnant), expanded tax dependency status for fetuses, and expanded prosecutors’ access to medical records. Following an immediate legal challenge by an abortion rights coalition, which included the Atlanta abortion clinic Feminist Women’s Health Center, a federal court kept the law from taking effect until July 2022—about three weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That month, a federal appeals court made the unusual decision of immediately instating the law, changing Georgia’s abortion limits from 22 weeks to 6 weeks in an instant.

About a week later, pro-abortion plaintiffs including abortion providers, clinics, and advocates, filed a new and separate case in state court, contending the law was null and void under the Georgia Constitution when it was first signed into law. In 2019, Roe was still the law, so the state legislature shouldn’t have been allowed to enact a six-week ban that year, let alone revive the legislation after the Dobbs decision, the plaintiffs argued. The case also argued that the state constitution has strong protections for individual privacy, including medical decisions like abortion.

Six of the state’s highest court justices disagreed, allowing the ban to remain in effect, with one justice dissenting. “The holdings of U.S. Supreme Court cases interpreting the U.S. Constitution that have since been overruled cannot establish that a law was unconstitutional when enacted,” Georgia Supreme Court Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority. (Colvin was appointed to the state’s highest bench by Gov. Kemp in 2021.) Justice John Ellington, the lone dissenter, wrote that the ban “was void when passed because its ban on most abortions after” six weeks “would unduly interfere with a woman’s then-protected right under the U.S. Constitution to terminate a pregnancy before viability.”

Now, the case is back to Fulton Superior Judge Robert McBurney, who had previously ordered the state to not enforce the law but had not ruled on its constitutionality. The Supreme Court now wants him to consider constitutional arguments. We don’t yet know if there will be updated arguments since he already sat through a two-day trial in October 2022. And if McBurney makes a ruling that anti-abortion policymakers don’t care for? It could go back to the state Supreme Court…again. Litigation could continue for years.

“I applaud Justice Colvin and the Georgia Supreme Court for ruling today that our written Constitution controls over judge-made law,” Kemp told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Today’s victory represents one more step towards ending this litigation and ensuring the lives of Georgians at all ages are protected.”

Plaintiffs were gutted in a statement released to reporters on Tuesday. Kwajelyn Jackson, executive director of Feminist Women’s Health Center, said they still get calls from people across the region who need abortion care. “It is heart-wrenching that we are being forced to turn patients away who need abortion care beyond the earliest weeks of pregnancy,” Jackson said in a statement to Jezebel. “We have been continuing to get calls from patients across Georgia and the Southeast who have nowhere in their own communities to turn to for care. Abortion is an essential component of reproductive health care, and this law is putting people’s lives at risk.”"

Aug 10 2023,Arizonans taking names for abortion referendum,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/aug/10/arizonans-taking-names-for-abortion-referendum,"PHOENIX -- Abortion-rights advocates on Tuesday began a push to ask Arizona voters to create a constitutional right to abortion, injecting the issue into the battleground state's volatile politics ahead of next year's election.

If proponents collect enough signatures, Arizona will become the latest state to put the question of reproductive rights directly to voters, who have turned out in large numbers to support abortion rights even in conservative states.

The fight over abortion rights helped Democrats limit their losses in last year's midterms after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. The issue remains salient as President Joe Biden seeks reelection in the face of sagging approval ratings.

Arizona currently bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with limited exceptions. Abortion opponents have asked the Arizona Supreme Court to allow enforcement of a law dating to the Civil War that bans virtually all abortions.

The proposed constitutional amendment would guarantee abortion rights until a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also would allow later abortions to save the mother's life or to protect her physical or mental health.

""We know the work for achieving reproductive freedom is an uphill battle, and this ballot initiative is the next critical step in our renewed drive to protect the health and freedom of our patients and our communities,"" said Chris Love, senior adviser to Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, the political arm of the state's leading abortion provider.

Maria Birnbaum, Arizona director for the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said the proposal ""aims to create an Arizona unrecognizable to those of us who live here.""

""This proposal would impose painful late-term abortions up to birth,"" Birnbaum said in a statement.

The Republican Party has struggled to navigate the politics of abortion since the Supreme Court's decision last year rescinding federal protections for the procedure put the question at the forefront of state politics and created a state-by-state patchwork of restrictions and bans.

Voters in Republican-leaning states, including Kansas and Kentucky, have responded by protecting abortion access. Voters in Ohio on Tuesday rejected a proposed constitutional change that would have made it tougher to protect abortion rights.

In Arizona, about two-thirds of voters said in last year's midterms that the Supreme Court's abortion ruling was an important factor in their vote, according to AP VoteCast, an expansive survey of more than 3,200 voters in Arizona. Those voters overwhelmingly favored Democrat Katie Hobbs, who narrowly won the governor's race.

""I'm thrilled that Arizonans are going to have the opportunity to make their voices heard next November, and I'm confident they will support a constitutional right to abortion,"" Hobbs said in a statement released Tuesday by her political adviser.

Biden won Arizona by fewer than 11,000 votes, one of his narrowest victories in 2020, and the state will again be central to his campaign. Biden made his second trip to Arizona as president Tuesday, announcing a national monument designation for the greater Grand Canyon.

The abortion-rights groups behind the Arizona initiative include the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, Affirm Sexual and Reproductive Health, Arizona List, Planned Parenthood Advocates of Arizona, NARAL Arizona, and Healthcare Rising Arizona. They'll have to collect 384,000 signatures from registered voters by July to put the question on the 2024 ballot."

Issue 1: Abortion and reproductive rights

Issue 2: Legalization of recreational weed

READ MORE: Understanding Issue 2, whether or not to legal recreational weed in Ohio

Issue 1, titled the “Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative,” would add constitutional protections to Ohio’s laws.

A vote to approve Issue 1 would do the following:

Establish in the Constitution of the State of Ohio an individual right to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion;

Create legal protections for any person or entity that assists a person with receiving reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion;

Prohibit the State from directly or indirectly burdening, penalizing, or prohibiting abortion before an unborn child is determined to be viable, unless the State demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means;

Grant a pregnant woman’s treating physician the authority to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an unborn child is viable;

Only allow the State to prohibit an abortion after an unborn child is determined by a pregnant woman’s treating physician to be viable and only if the physician does not consider the abortion necessary to protect the pregnant woman’s life or health;

and Always allow an unborn child to be aborted at any stage of pregnancy, regardless of viability if, in the treating physician’s determination, the abortion is necessary to protect the pregnant woman’s life or health.

If Issue 1 does not pass, the above changes would not happen. Ohio would keep the state’s current laws on abortion and reproductive rights.

Aug 09 2023,Murphy cheers Ohio abortion vote,New Jersey Globe,center,https://newjerseyglobe.com/national/murphy-cheers-ohio-abortion-vote,"Gov. Phil Murphy today applauded the outcome of a special referendum election last night in Ohio that has implications for that state’s abortion policies.

Ohio voters rejected Issue 1, a proposal that would have made it harder to amend the state’s constitution, by a 14-point margin. The vote is seen as a win for reproductive rights activists, who believe the vote paves the way for a proposed state constitutional amendment that would enshrine reproductive rights in the state.



That amendment will be on the ballot in November.

“Congratulations to the voters of Ohio, who roundly rejected an effort by anti-choice forces to change the state’s constitutional amendment process in a brazen attempt to limit abortion rights,” Murphy said. “The choice to start a family should not involve the government. At a time when reproductive rights and democracy are under siege, the people of Ohio made their voices heard that they oppose government-mandated pregnancy.”

Murphy is the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, where the abortion issue could energize bases for both parties in the Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi gubernatorial contests.



After the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision in 2022, pro-life supporters prevailed when Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure denying constitutional protections for abortion. Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who had vetoed a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, is up for re-election this year with Murphy’s support.



Democrats view abortion as a fruitful political issue for them, according to Tom Bonier, a Democratic strategist with clients in New Jersey.



“Clearly, the issue is holding its political salience, and the Ohio results suggest it may even be strengthening,” said Bonior.

Following the Supreme Court’s Dobb’s decision last year – the case that overturned Roe v. Wade – Murphy worked with the legislature to codify Roe into New Jersey state law."
Nov 28 2023,Group working on second draft of ballot proposal to restore Arkansas abortion access after AG rejection,KARK,center,https://kark.com/news/your-local-election-hq/group-working-on-second-draft-of-ballot-proposal-to-restore-arkansas-abortion-access-after-ag-rejection,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A proposed ballot title that would restore abortion access in Arkansas has been rejected by the Arkansas attorney general.

KARK 4 News first reported on the amendment Monday, after learning the group For AR People submitted the ballot title to Attorney General Tim Griffin on Nov. 9.

Supporters said this would change the state constitution to make reproductive health decisions private up to the 18th week of pregnancy.

“This amendment isn’t pro-choice, it’s not pro-life, it’s pro-people,” For AR People Content Manager Samuel Watson said. “It’s dedicated towards supporting doctors and patients as they try to waive through what can be really difficult situations for pregnant women.”

Watson said the group is not discouraged by the AG’s decision to reject the ballot proposal on the first round, because it is what they expected, based on other amendments that come to his desk.

The opinion calls for clarify regarding the words, “access” and “health.”

Another aspect of the proposal that was intended to restrict the state legislature in passing laws restricting abortion access was also unclear, the opinion stated.

The “18th week” was also an issue because, per the opinion, it was based on 18 weeks after conception, but the legal standard for fetus age is gestational age.

“When counting from the more standard starting point, the reference to ‘18 weeks’ is closer to ‘20 weeks,’” the opinion stated.

Another reason for rejection was said to be a failure to describe its impact on existing laws, including Constitutional Amendment 68.

Amendment 68 was created in 1988 and states that, “The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.”

“We expected to do a few rounds back and forth with the AG,” Watson said, “He’s just doing his job.”

Watson said the group is already working with its lawyers on the second draft to submit to Griffin, and they hope to have an approval as soon as possible so they can start collecting signatures for their July deadline.

In the meantime, the group is taking signature pledges on its website."
Aug 09 2023,"Abortion, the Ohio vote and the Great Reversal",AlterNet,left,https://alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/abortionm-ohio-vote-great-reversal,"The big news this morning comes out of Ohio, where voters in a special election rejected a proposal that would have made it harder to change the state’s constitution by popular vote. Supporters had hoped to stop a measure in the fall that aims to constitutionally enshrine abortion rights.

It backfired.

Here’s the AP: “Voter opposition to the proposal was widespread, even spreading into traditionally Republican territory. In fact, in early returns, support for the measure fell far short of former President Donald Trump’s performance during the 2020 election in nearly every county.”

The Republicans and business groups who had pushed for the referendum said that it would “protect the state’s foundational document from outside interest groups,” according to the AP. That might have been a convincing argument a year ago, but in the context of Dobbs, which overturned Roe, that argument sank out of sight. Fifty-seven percent of voters said nuh-uh.

The referendum’s critics say the vote is another example of the Great Reversal that has happened since a rightwing supermajority on the United States Supreme Court decided to immiserate the social standing of half the country, by repealing the national right to abortion, privacy and autonomy.

“The Ohio win again suggests that much of the grassroots energy on cultural issues right now is on the liberal side,” wrote the Post’s Greg Sargeant. “The politics are clear: Roe v Wade got Republicans out to vote. Dobbs is getting Democrats out to vote,” wrote anti-Trump Republican and podcaster Joe Walsh. “Trying to ban abortion is every bit as disastrous for Republicans as they wanted us to believe that supporting trans rights is for Democrats,” wrote Ari Drennen, a contributor to Media Matters. “Since Dobbs in June of 2022, Democrats keep overperforming expectations again and again, and Republicans keep underperforming. One side is fired up, governing well, working hard, winning, and the other side keeps losing and will have Trump as their nominee,” wrote Simon Rosenberg, a strategist.

I want to add some points that overlap the above.

READ MORE: Ohio voters reject GOP 'power grab' aimed at thwarting abortion rights amendment

1. The Republicans still seem to think that the “grassroots energy on cultural issues” remains on their side. That’s why we’re seeing, over and over, repeated efforts to completely ban abortion in states like Ohio. If they weren’t so busy suckling the teat of rightwing media, they might consider modulating their objectives. They can’t won’t stop suckling, though. The result is serial elections, linked to abortion, that hand them their asses.

2. The Republicans still seem to misunderstand the public’s complex view on abortion, because complexity is whitewashed by a rightwing media that the Republicans can’t stop won’t stop suckling. I’m generalizing here, but I’d guess that most people most of the time probably don’t like abortion, but they nevertheless want it to be safe and legal. Of those who hate it, at least some don’t want the state involved in private affairs. To these folk, Dobbs did not represent a restoration of the rights of states to determine abortion matters on their own. It represents an upheaval of the existing order.

3. The Republicans still seem to deny that two streams of political energy have converged. On the one hand are their obvious opponents, activists who are working to present pro-abortion ballot measures (like in Ohio) to the public. It’s the other hand that the Republicans seem oblivious to – respectable white people who just want things to go back to “normal.”

Though decided by justices who are said to be conservative, Dobbs was anything but conservative. It revoked a constitutional right that, since 1973, most people most of the time had come to take for granted. These streams of political energy are coming together in ways they have not in decades.

4. The Republicans still can’t believe, because they can’t stop won’t stop suckling the teat of rightwing media, that anyone would want things to go back to “normal.” They cannot see this: the more they try to completely ban abortion, the more agitated respectable white people are going to get. They cannot see the subliminal link between Dobbs and Donald Trump, the man most responsible for enabling the Supreme Court to launch its revolution. Both represent social strife. Both represent disorder. It’s not hard to imagine some Ohioans going to the polls to defend the status quo.

There is no going back to the pre-Dobbs era, but that fact does not make the argument for going back any less appealing. And that argument will continue grow in appeal to most Democrats and some Republicans, I think, as long as Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, thus overshadowing even the most “reasonable” arguments in favor of “the sanctity of life.”

We are seeing people who are fighting the new normal (Dobbs) joining forces with people who want to go back to “normal.” This merger has the making of a major reaction against 50 years of conservative dominance.

Wade on June 24, 2022. (Photo by Stefani Reynolds / AFP/Getty Images)

If you were a pro-life Republican, Ohio’s “Issue 1” ballot initiative represented an opportunity to prevent out-of-state liberal groups from implementing their abortion agenda. If you were pro-abortion access, the initiative reflected a naked attempt by Republicans in the state legislature to block voters from enacting their policy preferences. If you were a business group, Issue 1 offered insurance against populist economic policies like minimum wage hikes. If you were a union, you worried it could weaken an important check on lawmakers’ ability to curtail collective bargaining power. And if you read the ballot initiative itself, you would see that all it would do is slightly adjust signature requirements and the threshold for proposed amendments to the state constitution.

More than 3 million people turned out in yesterday’s off-cycle special election—about 4.1 million cast ballots in last fall’s high-profile U.S. Senate race—to vote on Issue 1, a constitutional amendment passed by the state legislature in May that would increase the required threshold for ballot-initiative amendments from 50 percent to 60 percent of votes cast and mandate petitioners secure signatures from all 88 counties in the state, up from the current specification of 44. After a high-profile campaign that came to be defined almost entirely by abortion, voters in the conservative-leaning state broke with elected Republicans and rejected the measure 57 percent to 43 percent, with 95 percent of precincts reporting .

Ohio’s law banning most abortions after six weeks of gestation—signed in 2019 but blocked from going into effect—snapped into place last year after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision before quickly being put on hold once again due to another challenge. The Ohio Supreme Court is expected to issue a more final verdict, but pro-abortion access groups, seeing the writing on the wall, began taking steps earlier this year to pursue a constitutional amendment enshrining the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution. Similar measures in other states have proven successful at the ballot box over the past year."
Nov 29 2023,"In Colorado, President Joe Biden nods to power of abortion in 2024 and will tout investments — while needling Boebert",The Denver Post,center,https://denverpost.com/2023/11/29/live-updates-president-joe-biden-inflation-reduction-act-lauren-boebert-pueblo,"PUEBLO — President Joe Biden, surrounded by American flags and standing against a backdrop of massive steel tubes destined for wind turbines, attempted to pound home the economic benefits of his signature big-spending legislation during his second visit to Colorado this year.

“We’re investing in America (and) investing in Americans. And it’s working,” Biden said Wednesday during a 24-minute speech from a temporary stage on the factory floor of CS Wind, the largest wind turbine tower manufacturer in the world.

The stop was part of the Democratic president’s “Investing in America” tour to tout the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act and other laws passed early in his term. The South Korea-based CS Wind cited the law as a factor in its $200 million investment in expanded capacity at the Pueblo plant, and with it, the creation of more than 800 new jobs.

Tony Salerno, a production manager for CS Wind, said during introductory remarks that “this factory found new life” when Biden signed the act into law.

The setting gave Biden a jumping-off point to cast the economy as strong — even as he acknowledged that there’s “more work to do” to slow down inflation.

Unemployment has sat below 4% for a stretch not seen since the 1950s, he said, and America’s share of manufacturing for high-tech components such as microchips is rebounding. More than 250,000 new jobs have started in Colorado alone during his administration, Biden said.

Despite that messaging and the positive data points, voters have a sour view of the economy — and they largely blame Biden for it, according to recent polls.

A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed a 37% overall approval rating for Biden as he ramps up his reelection campaign. The survey found that just 32% of adults approve of his handling of the economy.

Beyond his economic message, the Pueblo setting also gave Biden a stage to slam Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, a Republican whose sprawling district includes the blue-collar city, as “one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement” standing against his efforts.

Displaying a sly grin, he made the sign of the cross at his first mention of Boebert.

She voted against the Inflation Reduction Act and several other laws Biden credited with spurring more than $1 billion in private investment in Colorado. Boebert narrowly won reelection in 2022.

After rattling off investments in microchip manufacturing, solar energy and wind turbine manufacturing, Biden quoted Boebert’s past criticism of the IRA, chiding: “Folks, none of that sounds like a ‘massive failure’ to me.”

“You all know you’re part of a massive failure?” Biden said. “Tell that to the 850 Coloradans who get new jobs in Pueblo at CS Wind thanks to this law. Tell that to the local economy that’s going to benefit from these investments.”

Ahead of Biden’s speech, a statement from Boebert criticized the president and “Bidenomics” — a term emblazoned on a banner in the rafters during Biden’s event.

“On Joe Biden’s watch, credit card debt, inflation, groceries and gas prices have all reached record highs,” Boebert said. “These high prices are squeezing working-class Coloradans and rural America. Rather than cutting wasteful federal spending and unleashing American energy production, Joe Biden continues to pander to radical extremists, lock up more land, and spend his time focused on campaign stunts and vacations rather than doing the job he was elected to do.”

(View the White House’s recorded video on YouTube.)

Besides Boebert, Biden took aim at former President Donald Trump, now his potential 2024 election opponent.

Trump also was Biden’s focus during a fundraiser Tuesday night in Cherry Hills Village at the home of Tamara Totah Picache, a managing partner of the Flatiron Group. He drew contrasts with Trump and highlighted public response to the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn abortion rights established by Roe v. Wade.

“Donald Trump’s about to find out the power of women in America in 2024,” Biden told attendees, according to a press pool report.

The president had planned to visit Pueblo last month but postponed the trip because of the escalating conflict between Israel and Hamas. U.S. support for Israel during its war in the Gaza Strip, which was launched in response to a terrorist attack by Hamas on Oct. 7, has posed political challenges for Biden among his Democratic base.

On Tuesday night, a few dozen pro-Palestinian protesters demonstrated on the street in front of the hotel where Biden stayed in downtown Denver.

Biden last visited Colorado in June, when he delivered a commencement address at the U.S. Air Force Academy.

During his Pueblo visit Wednesday, the CS Wind factory looked as though work had stopped mid-production, with metal tubes — a dozen feet or more in diameter and weighing tons — lying on the floor. On a typical day, it would be a hive of work and a cacophony of warning bells, whirring motors, welding hisses and hammering steel.

Biden went on a tour of the factory before his speech. He asked workers questions about the process for building the giant wind turbines and other work conducted on-site, according to a press pool report.

At one point, he shouted to a worker: “Corey, watch out that entire sucker starts coming back towards you.”

U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, predicted the $740 million Inflation Reduction Act’s impact on the country eventually would be likened to President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. Hickenlooper proved a key negotiator last year as senators recruited enough votes to pass the bill, which included record climate spending.

“Energy independence begins in places like Pueblo,” Hickenlooper said.

Biden and his allies also extolled the effects of the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, passed in 2021, and other legislation that has invested in high-tech manufacturing.

State Sen. Nick Hinrichsen, a Pueblo Democrat, said the setting Wednesday reflected the historic steel town’s “resiliency and its expertise,” while the investment in the wind tower factory represents “long-term growth and sustainability” for the community.

He sees the area as sitting at a crossroads, since it’s also home to the state’s largest coal-fired power plant, which is preparing to shut down in the next decade. CS Wind’s expansion, he said, moves the community and the state forward.

“We’ve got concerns about (the coal plant) and what replaces that,” Hinrichsen said. “But we’re also providing the energy that will power our state into the future cleanly and renewably.”

Sep 02 2023,American College of OBGYNs Calls For No Limits on Abortion,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/09/02/american-college-obgyns-calls-for-no-limits-abortion,"One of the nation’s most influential medical organizations wrote an op-ed published in The Washington Post on Wednesday calling for abortion with no restrictions.

In the op-ed, the American College of OBGYN (ACOG) and Society of Family Planning called for abortion on demand and claimed that abortion “saves lives.” This comes as Democrats continue to deny that they support abortion up until birth, despite evidence to the contrary.

“It improves and saves lives, and it must be available without restrictions, without limitations, and without barriers — just as any other critical part of health care,” wrote ACOG interim chief executive Christopher Zahn and director of advocacy and public affairs for the Society of Family Planning Jenni Villavicencio.

WATCH: Doctor Claims Every Major Medical Organization Promoting Abortion and Ignoring the Medical Evidence

Zahn and Villavicencio wrote the op-ed in response to another Washington Post op-ed written by the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, and Kellyanne Conway, former counselor to President Donald Trump, calling on Republican presidential candidates to “go on offense on abortion.”

“One of the most harmful things Republicans said about abortion over the past year was … nothing. Many panicked and chose to bury their heads in the sand, allowing their opponents to attack them,” their piece reads, “while missing an opportunity to share a positive pro-life vision for the future. … America needs a national defender of life who will boldly advance this crucial human rights cause.”

Dannenfelser issued a statement in response to ACOG’s op-ed.

“In an Informed debate, the truth is what matters and now we finally hear the truth from the abortion lobby. So now we take this question of abortion limits to voters and those running for public office,” she said. “Americans are compassionate people and overwhelmingly reject all-trimester abortions on demand. The more they learn of the extremist positions of organizations in power, the more they reject them.”

Dr. Ingrid Skop, a board-certified OB-GYN who has practiced in Texas for nearly 30 years and serves as vice president and director of medical affairs at Charlotte Lozier Institute also responded, saying in a statement:

As an obstetrician for the last 30 years, I have advocated and cared for both of my patients—mothers and their unborn children. This brazen proclamation from ACOG, while sad to see, is reflective of a discouraging new reality: In ACOG’s leadership and the broader medical community, there’s no place for dissent on the issue of unlimited abortion for any reason, at any time in pregnancy. We are witnessing, in real time, a vocal, political takeover of a scientific community that represents the most honorable and beautiful profession, responsible for safely bringing new life into the world. I wish ACOG would realize that their promotion of elective abortion without limits isn’t reflective of the views of their own members, considering 86-93 percent of practicing obstetricians will not perform an elective abortion.

WATCH: Abortions Can Be Lucrative

Skop added in a comment to CBN that “it’s good that this discussion is happening so that the American public can come to the realization that yes, late abortions are happening, yes, they’re dangerous, they are killing babies electively, healthy babies, in healthy mothers.”

CBN further quoted Skop:

“The other discussion that we’re not having that we need to have is that some of these babies are born alive, and do not leave the abortion clinic alive, because nobody is supervising abortion clinics to make sure that they’re not actually committing infanticide,” Skop continued. “So our country’s very extreme. I think most people don’t realize that. And yet if you ask them, consistently they say, ‘No, we should have restrictions far earlier in pregnancy.'”

Several states — run by Democrats — notably have no restrictions on abortion whatsoever, including Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, DC. Many other Democrat-run states, like California, New York, and Illinois, allow abortions up to “viability” but allow abortions later in pregnancy with limited exceptions, including if a woman’s “mental health” is in danger.

On the federal level, Democrats have also supported a radical piece of proposed abortion legislation called the “Women’s Health Protection Act.” The legislation would usurp states’ ability to pass strong pro-life laws and would allow abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.

As Breitbart News reported in 2019, Virginia Democrat Delegate Kathy Tran proposed a measure that year that would not only allow abortion throughout all nine months of pregnancy in the state but would even permit a woman to decide whether she wants to “abort” her baby as she is dilating and about to give birth.

At that time, then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said the bill introduced in the House of Delegates that would allow “abortion” even during childbirth would permit an “infant” to be “delivered” and “resuscitated, if that’s what the mother and the family desired,” until the physicians and mother discuss what to do.

VA Gov Northam is no moderate, this is one of the most vile, radical pro-abortion positions ever put forward. This is evil. He should recant or resign. https://t.co/Npxa4c5JdI — Jim DeMint (@JimDeMint) January 30, 2019

Democrat lawmakers in California came under fire for language that appeared to protect women from criminal penalties for “perinatal death” — or death in the first month after birth. Critics said the language “perinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause” could effectively legalize infanticide, and the statute was changed to “perinatal death due to causes that occurred in utero” before its passage and Governor Gavin Newsom’s signature.

Nov 02 2023,An Ohio amendment serves as a testing ground for statewide abortion fights expected in 2024,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/election-2023-abortion-rights-ohio-e3edc16a1bfaa22b9e72bc1d6fb76dd0,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Abortion access is expected to play a central role in the 2024 elections. The preview comes next week, when Ohio voters decide whether to enshrine reproductive rights in their state Constitution.

The amendment is the only abortion question on any state’s ballot this year, a spotlight that has generated intense attention from national groups and made Ohio a testing ground for fresh campaign messaging — some of it misleading. The amendment has drawn more than $60 million in combined spending so far.

Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said Ohio offers a vital proving ground heading into next year’s presidential election, when Democrats hope the abortion issue can energize supporters in contests up and down the ballot. Abortion-related initiatives could be on the ballot across the country, including in the presidential swing states of Arizona, Nevada and Pennsylvania.

“When we’re able to see how our messaging impacts independents and Republicans and persuades them that this fundamental freedom is important to protect in Ohio, that’s going to be something that we can implement looking at 2024,” she said.

The battleground on abortion shifted to the states last summer, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned its Roe v. Wade decision, erasing federal abortion protections that had been in place for half a century. Since then, voters in six states — California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont — have either supported measures protecting abortion rights or rejected efforts aimed at eroding access.

Kelsey Pritchard, state public affairs director for the anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America, said the outcomes in 2022 offered lessons that the anti-abortion movement has implemented in Ohio through more coalition-building and stronger messaging.

Abortion opponents, she said, “will apply those weapons and learning in other states going forward.”

Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose advanced ballot language for the Ohio amendment that its supporters said was misleading, while GOP Attorney General Dave Yost took the unconventional step of producing his own ”legal analysis” of the amendment. Its supporters said those actions by top state officials could cost them votes.

But like the anti-abortion movement itself, Ohio’s Republicans have not been in lockstep on the issue.

The GOP-led Ohio Senate has used its website to spread misleading claims about the amendment even as Gov. Mike DeWine has made the rounds of TV stations pledging that his party will pass a reasonable alternative if voters defeat the measure. For the first time in his 46-year political career, DeWine now says he would support exceptions for rape and incest in any future abortion legislation if the measure fails.

The governor has allied with the Ohio Catholic Conference, which is running a campaign through its churches to defeat the amendment, which is on the ballot as Issue 1. Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against it, also has generated support from some Black faith leaders.

Supporters have answered with an ad featuring the senior minister of First Congregational Church in Columbus, who called abortion a private matter and said “government needs to stay out of family decision-making.”

The Ohio amendment would guarantee an individual’s right “to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” It expressly permits the state to regulate abortions after fetal viability, as determined by an attending physician, as long as any laws regulating the procedure after that point provide exceptions for the life and health of the woman.

Its supporters include Democrats in the state, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and a bipartisan coalition of labor, faith and community groups. They portray the measure — one of the most broadly worded so far — as a way to enshrine Roe-era abortion rights in a one-time bellwether state that has turned increasingly Republican and has passed some of the nation’s toughest restrictions on the procedure.

That includes a law currently held up by legal challenges that bans most abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, before many women know they’re pregnant. That law makes no exceptions for rape or incest.

“This is the most conservative state to date where we’re pushing for proactive state constitutional amendments,” said Carolyn Ehrlich, senior campaign strategist at the ACLU.

Opponents, including state Republicans, the Center for Christian Virtue and Ohio Right to Life, say the amendment provides too much access to abortion and does so too late into pregnancy. They question whether state lawmakers could pass any abortion restrictions at all that would pass constitutional muster if voters approve the amendment.

“This is more than just a pro-choice or pro-life statement,” said Megan Wold, a former deputy Ohio solicitor general working with Protect Women Ohio. “It is an up or down vote, but it’s an up or down vote on very particular language that’s going to have a real impact on the way that Ohio can regulate abortion in the future.”

Protect Women Ohio’s interest in persuading independent and politically moderate voters is about the math, since public support for some form of abortion rights has remained well over the 50% mark in the U.S. for years. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal.

Peter Range, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said strong turnout and enthusiasm at the March for Life held at the Ohio Statehouse last month gave him “great hope” for victory on Tuesday.

He said Issue 1 goes too far in limiting the state “and I think once most Ohioans realize that, they’re going to reject it.”

The Issue 1 campaign, Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, is working to appeal to voters across party lines with a message focused on bodily autonomy and freedom from government intervention.

Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director of URGE and a member of the coalition supporting the amendment, said messaging similar to Ohio’s was effective across party lines in deeply Republican Kansas, which surprised the nation when it became the first state to protect the right to an abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe.

“I think there’s a very progressive value in being able to maintain our liberty, maintain our freedom, have the government not tell us what to do with our bodies,” she said.

McGuire said supporters of abortion rights also were energized by an August special election in which the GOP-led state Legislature advanced a proposal that would have set a 60% supermajority requirement for passing future constitutional amendments. The measure failed badly, and she said it soured many voters on trusting their elected representatives.

Turnout in the election that concludes Tuesday is expected to be robust, building on the enthusiasm from the summer, organizers say. Local election officials anticipate 40% to 50% of registered voters will participate, according to the Ohio Association of Election Officials. That’s higher than a typical off-year November election and up from the 39% turnout in August.

“Ohio voters really know what’s at stake here, because they’ve seen the incredible lengths that the Ohio government will go to to interfere in people’s lives,” McGuire said. “The August election laid bare the strategy of the anti-abortion movement — which is that they understand that the people oppose abortion bans, and so it is now their strategy to put a stranglehold on democracy to try to thwart democratic efforts to support abortion access.”

Nov 02 2023,Tommy Tuberville's anti-abortion protest is causing outrage among Senate Republicans,NPR Fact Check,left,https://npr.org/2023/11/02/1210266271/tommy-tubervilles-anti-abortion-protest-is-causing-outrage-among-senate-republic,"Tommy Tuberville's anti-abortion protest is causing outrage among Senate Republicans

Senate Republicans have erupted in anger at Tommy Tuberville's hold on military promotions. On Wednesday, several Republicans tried to force votes on the promotions of more than 60 military officers.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Alabama Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville has been blocking virtually all military promotions since February over his objection to an unrelated Pentagon abortion policy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

Last night, several of his fellow Republicans, including Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, went to the Senate floor to try to force votes on the promotions of more than 60 military officers.

SHAPIRO: Each time, Tuberville objected.

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

JON OSSOFF: Senator from Alabama.

TOMMY TUBERVILLE: Reserving the right to object.

I object.

I object.

And so, Mr. President, I object.

OSSOFF: The objection is heard.

SUMMERS: Sullivan began things by saying he wanted the American people to know that, in all, 376 promotions are being held up.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAN SULLIVAN: It is estimated, by the end of this year, 89% of all general officer positions in the United States military will be affected by the current holds from Senator Tuberville.

SHAPIRO: Senator Ernst talked about the real impacts this is having on military families - spouses who've lost jobs because promotions are stuck in limbo, leaving the family with no idea where they will live and serve. And military kids?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JONI ERNST: They are unable to reenroll in school or enroll in a new school since they do not have a permanent address.

SUMMERS: Tuberville, for his part, never changed his mind.

SHAPIRO: NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman and congressional correspondent Claudia Grisales are following this. Hi, there.

TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.

CLAUDIA GRISALES, BYLINE: Hey, Ari.

SHAPIRO: Claudia, this process last night took four hours, with Republican senators growing angrier as it went on. You can hear the frustration. Is all this pressure making any difference?

GRISALES: Well, the Senate has been able to approve a few promotions here and there, but Tuberville is not budging on the vast majority of these. And he says this shouldn't be a surprise since he's been doing this for nine months. And he says he warned his Republican colleagues how last night was going to play out. He says he wanted to see one-by-one floor votes instead.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TUBERVILLE: I told them beforehand. You know, I didn't want to embarrass them right there in front of everybody. I told them I wanted a floor vote. That wasn't a floor vote, OK?

GRISALES: So he was pretty defensive on his plans going forward. And he's holding this stance, opposing these nominees as a result of a Pentagon policy that allows service members to get assistance to seek abortion care.

SHAPIRO: Tom, you've been covering this for months, and it seemed to finally take a heart attack from a senior U.S. officer to move this debate along in the Senate. What happened?

BOWMAN: Well, that's right. The top marine officer, Gen. Eric Smith, had a heart attack over the weekend and now is in stable condition. His family is asking for privacy. But a few weeks back, Ari, Gen. Smith said he's working - get this - from 5:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night because he was doing two jobs, including that of his deputy, who was only confirmed just today. And Gen. Smith told a group a few weeks back that his work schedule is unsustainable - his word. So you're right. It took a heart attack for the Senate, basically, to do its job.

The Senate just today approved Adm. Lisa Franchetti as the Navy's top officer and also Gen. David Allvin to lead the Air Force. And as I said, the No. 2 Marine officer, Lt. Gen. Chris Mahoney, also was confirmed. The Senate leader, Democrat Chuck Schumer, said he was willing to hold votes on just some of the most important nominees. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he was glad for those votes today but said there are hundreds more, and the military must be at full strength.

SHAPIRO: So when you look across the armed forces, how is this broadly affecting the military?

BOWMAN: Well, you know, it depends who you talk with. Some say it's quite disruptive. There are those, like Gen. Smith, who are doing two jobs. The Army doesn't have a confirmed No. 2 officer as well. Some officers want to retire and are being told to stay. Others can't move to a new job because they haven't been confirmed. I'm told there's even one senior officer slated for promotion considering just retiring.

Now, others say the greater impact is on the families of senior officers that we just heard. You know, spouses who are planning to move and accept a job offer now have to scrap that plan. Kids can't enroll in a new school and are staying put - so very frustrating for families.

SHAPIRO: So Claudia, how is this impacting Republicans in the Senate?

GRISALES: Well, it's clear they're running out of patience, especially those with military backgrounds who were on the floor last night confronting Tuberville. I asked Joni Ernst. She happens to be an ex-Army officer, a combat veteran. She told me they're going to do this again next week, and she hopes more Republicans join them. And she went on to tell reporters about the risks here.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ERNST: We are really hurting the readiness. You hear people say they're not - it is hurting the readiness of our military. Our adversaries are watching us. We have to get this issue resolved.

GRISALES: And we should note this is forcing Senate Republicans to step into abortion politics, which can be a political loser for moderates and explains in part why it's taken Republicans so long to confront Tuberville. That said, Senate Democrats are looking at a procedural workaround that could go through with Republican support to approve the vast majority of these at once - maybe - in the coming days.

SHAPIRO: All right. NPR's Claudia Grisales and Tom Bowman. Thank you.

BOWMAN: You're welcome.

GRISALES: Thank you.

Nov 01 2023,Constitutional law expert weighs in on 'language disagreement' for 6 abortion ballot initiatives in Missouri,KSHB,center,https://kshb.com/news/local-news/constitutional-law-expert-weighs-in-on-language-disagreement-for-6-abortion-ballot-initiatives-in-missouri,"KANSAS CITY, Mo — In Missouri, six new ballot initiatives regarding abortion in the state have been introduced for next November’s general election.

Backers of the initiatives must secure more than 170,000 signatures from registered voters by early May. However, activist Sarah Starns has not launched a campaign yet because it's still undetermined what statement voters would see on their ballots.

A ballot summary is a 100-word, neutral and accurate explanation of the voting item at hand. Constitutional law expert Mark P. Johnson said these are critical because it can be the first and only opportunity for voters to make an educated decision.

“If they read a one-sided summary, such as I believe the secretary of state proposed, I believe it, naturally, I think, results in fewer people signing,” Johnson said.

Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft penned the summaries, which has caused contention between Ashcroft and abortion rights advocates. The advocates allege Ashcroft used biased language in the summaries like “dangerous, unregulated and regulated abortions.”

“The Secretary of State concocted a summary statement that's filled with bombastic, argumentative, hyperbolic language that misstates the purpose of the initiatives,” said Tony Rothert, of ACLU Missouri.

Ashcroft said if there were inflammatory language, it was warranted.

“It is because the initiative petition requires it,"" he said. ""We do not just make up language out of cold cloth, we do what the circuit court refuses to do — we go to the language of the initiative petition and we summarize that so the people of this state can make their own decision.""

Another point of debate is whether or not abortion rights advocates can start gathering signatures from voters.

Ashcroft said yes, but Johnson said not really.

“The concern I have is that if they gather signatures now, then it’s possible those signatures could be challenged if the ballot language changes — it is changed by the court,” Johnson said.

Johnson said such holdups put the advocates at a disadvantage, due to lack of time, but, fortunately, he believes the courts will decide on the language quickly in the coming week.

“There is a deadline in which the signatures would have to be gathered to get the referendum on the ballot,” Johnson said.

According to the Idaho State Journal, Kadyn Leo Swainston, 18, and his mother, Rachael Swainston, of Pocatello, were each charged with several felony crimes following an investigation that began in June.

ISJ noted that Kadyn Swainston has been charged with rape, second-degree kidnapping and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material. Rachael Swainston has been charged with second-degree kidnapping, trafficking in methamphetamine, two counts of possession of a controlled substance – one each for possessing fentanyl and psychedelic mushrooms — and one count of harboring a wanted felon.

Reportedly, the investigation started in June when the 15-year-old girl’s mother contacted authorities to report that her child had been raped. Additionally, the mother claimed that her child was taken to Bend, Oregon for an abortion without her permission.

In a forensic interview in August, the 15-year-old girl disclosed that she was in a consensual relationship with Kadyn Swainston that began when he was 17 and continued after he turned 18, the report claims. After Kadyn turned 18, she discovered that she was pregnant. While she was “happy” about the pregnancy, Kadyn was not and “demanded” she get an abortion.

On May 18, the 15-year-old claimed, Rachael Swainston allegedly rented a car and traveled with her and Kadyn to Oregon for an abortion. The teenage girl provided law enforcement with the medical documentation she received after the abortion.

Phone records from Kadyn and Rachael indicate that they traveled to Bend, Oregon on May 18.

Additionally, the 15-year-old provided police permission to “forensically extract data from her cell phone,” which showed photos and a video of Kadyn and herself “engaging in various sex acts.” In an interview, Kadyn admitted to engaging in sex acts with the girl after he turned 18. He also admitted that his mother transported her to Oregon to get an abortion.

During the search warrant, police located over 40 grams of meth in Rachael’s room and arrested a man who was “staying in her storage shed.” He was arrested on an outstanding felony for felony meth trafficking charges.

Reportedly, the felony meth trafficking charge Rachael faces carries a maximum penalty of up to life in prison if she is convicted. If convicted of the four other felony charges, Rachael faces up to 44 years in prison and a fine of up $130,000.

If convicted of the rape charge, Kadyn faces up to life in prison. Reportedly, the other four felony charges he faces carry a maximum penalty of up to 115 years in prison and a fine of up to $200,000.

This year, Idaho introduced a first-of-its-kind legislation surrounding abortion. Gov. Brad Little, a Republican, made history by signing an “abortion trafficking” bill into law, ensuring that adults do not take pregnant minors across state lines to terminate a pregnancy.

“An adult who, with the intent to conceal an abortion from the parents or guardian of a pregnant, un-emancipated minor, either procures an abortion … or obtains an abortion-inducing drug for the pregnant minor to use for an abortion by recruiting, harboring, or transporting the pregnant minor within this state commits the crime of abortion trafficking,” the law, H.B. 242, states, which Townhall covered. Those who break the law could face two to five years behind bars and be sued by the child’s parent or legal guardian.

State Rep. Kevin Andrus, a Republican, told the Associated Press that parents’ rights were the main focus of the bill.

“We want to make sure that parents have a say in the life choices of their children,” Andrus said. “It will do a lot to save lives.”"
Nov 01 2023,Idaho mother and son charged with kidnapping over out-of-state abortion,The Guardian,left,https://theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/01/idaho-mother-son-kidnap-charges-abortion,"An Idaho mother and son have been charged with second-degree kidnapping for allegedly taking an underage girl across state lines for an abortion without her parents’ knowledge.

Idaho police started investigating Kadyn Swainston and his mother, Rachael Swainston, after the girl’s mother reported to police that her daughter had been sexually assaulted and taken to Oregon for an abortion earlier this year.

The girl, who was supposed to have been living with her father, had instead been living with the Swainstons for six months, according to court records obtained by the Guardian. She had been in a consensual sexual relationship with Kadyn Swainston since she was 15 and he was 17, and the relationship continued after he turned 18, the girl told police. She said she became pregnant around the time of Kadyn Swainston’s 18th birthday.

The girl said that she was “happy” to learn she was pregnant, but said Kadyn Swainston told her that he would not pay child support and that the relationship would be over if she gave birth, court records show. The girl also said that Rachael Swainston made the arrangements for the girl to have an abortion. Rachael Swainston told the girl that Kadyn Swainston would get in trouble because he was over 18, and threatened to kick her out of the house if she revealed she was pregnant to her parents, police said.

The girl obtained an abortion in Oregon in May, she said. Police used cellphone data to confirm that her phone, Kadyn’s phone, and Rachael’s phone traveled to Oregon together around the time of the procedure, court records show.

Idaho bans almost all abortions. The Swainstons have not been charged under Idaho’s so-called “abortion trafficking” statute, a first-of-its-kind law that penalizes people who take minors across state lines for abortions without their parents’ consent. However, their charges are already being held up as a test case for the highly controversial statute, which is now at the center of a lawsuit filed by abortion rights supporters.

At least one anti-abortion website has also covered the case as evidence of the need for laws that require minors to get their parents involved before having an abortion.

Eventually, the girl was told to leave the Swainstons’ house, she told police.

During their investigation, police found sexually explicit video and photos of the girl and Kadyn Swainston – some of which were captured after Kadyn’s 18th birthday, according to court records.

In addition to the kidnapping charge, Kadyn Swainston has been charged with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material. Kadyn Swainston told police he had sex with the girl, and that he and his mother took the girl to Oregon, where she obtained an abortion.

Rachael Swainston is also facing multiple drug charges. She told police she did take the girl to Oregon for an abortion, according to court records. But Rachael Swainston said the abortion was a mutual decision by Kadyn Swainston and the girl, and denied coercing the girl into the procedure.

Court records show both Swainstons have been assigned a local public defender. The public defender’s office did not immediately return a request for comment."

The Justice Department has formally determined that it cannot do this, stating its position as part of lawsuits against Attorney General Steve Marshall.

The Justice Department filed a statement of its position in consolidated lawsuits against Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, arguing that such prosecutions would be unconstitutional. The lawsuits, filed by an abortion fund and former providers, seek a court ruling clarifying the state can't use conspiracy statutes to prosecute people who help Alabama women travel elsewhere to obtain an abortion. Marshall has not prosecuted anyone for providing such assistance, but he has made statements saying that his office would ""look at"" groups that provide abortion help. The Justice Department argued in the filing that the U.S. Constitution protects the right to travel.

Abortion is effectively illegal in Alabama after the U.S. Supreme Court's overturned of Roe v. Wade, with no exceptions for rape and incest."

Oct 31 2023,Appeals court swats down Ashcroft arguments on Missouri abortion rights petitions,Missouri Independent,left,https://missouriindependent.com/2023/10/31/appeals-court-swats-down-ashcroft-arguments-on-missouri-abortion-rights-petitions,"Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft wrote ballot titles for six proposals to restore abortion rights that were “replete with politically partisan language,” a Missouri appeals court unanimously ruled Tuesday.

In an expedited decision issued a day after hearing arguments, a three-judge panel of the Western District Court of Appeals upheld, with only minor revisions, the revised ballot titles written by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem.

In a decision by a separate panel, the court upheld the fiscal note summary written by State Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick. Rejecting arguments from two lawmakers and an anti-abortion activist, the court said Fitzpatrick’s summary was “fair and sufficient.”

Ashcroft issued a statement that he would appeal the decision to the Missouri Supreme Court, a process likely to take several weeks. The ongoing court battle narrows the time for gathering signatures to put the proposal on the 2024. Backers must secure more than 170,000 signatures from registered voters by early May.

A key error in Ashcroft’s ballot titles, states the opinion signed by Judge Thomas Chapman, was its single-minded focus on how it would impact the legality of abortion. The proposed constitutional amendments, he wrote, cover all aspects of reproductive health care.

“The absence of any reference to a right to reproductive health care beyond abortion in the summary statements is misleading,” Chapman wrote.

There was little to be saved from Ashcroft’s summaries, he wrote.

“The secretary’s summary statements do not fairly describe the purposes and probable effects of the initiatives,” he wrote. “The secretary’s summary statements are replete with politically partisan language.”

Chapman zeroed in on particular phrases as especially troublesome. In the ballot title for each of the six proposals, Ashcroft wrote that passage would “nullify longstanding Missouri law protecting the right to life, including but not limited to partial-birth abortion.”

The phrase “right to life,” like its counterpart in the abortion debate, “right to choose,” is a partisan phrase intended to trigger a particular response, Chapman wrote.

“The use of the term ‘right to life’ is simply not an impartial term,” he wrote.

The same is true for “partial birth abortion,” he wrote, calling it “a politically charged phrase” that “carries no fixed definition.”

The lengthy battle to get ballot titles written began when Anna Fitz-James, a St. Louis physician, filed 11 proposed constitutional amendments with Ashcroft’s office in March on behalf of a political action committee called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom.

The proposals would amend the constitution to declare that the “government shall not infringe upon a person’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”

That would include “prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care and respectful birthing conditions.” Penalties for both patients seeking reproductive-related care and medical providers would be outlawed.

Each version of the proposed amendment says there must be a “compelling governmental interest” for abortion restrictions to be put in place. But while some allow the legislature to regulate abortion after “fetal viability,” others draw the line at 24 weeks of gestation.

Some versions make it clear the state can enact parental consent laws for minors seeking abortions. Others leave the topic out entirely.

Under Missouri law, Ashcroft had up to 56 days to obtain certifications of the form and fiscal note, write a ballot title and certify the petition for circulation.

Attorney General Andrew Bailey tested his authority during that process, refusing to certify the fiscal note summary written by Fitzpatrick until the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in July that his role was limited to determining whether it fit the form required by law.

With legal backing of the ACLU of Missouri, Fitz-James sued Ashcroft over his ballot titles. That led to Beetem’s ruling on Sept. 25 and the subsequent appeal.

In a statement issued Tuesday, the ACLU called the appeals court ruling a complete victory.

“Today, the courts upheld Missourians’ constitutional right to direct democracy over the self-serving attacks of politicians desperately seeking to climb the political ladder,” the statement read. “The decision from Missouri Court of Appeals is a complete rebuke of the combined efforts from the Attorney General and Secretary of State to interfere and deny Missourian’s their right to initiative process.”

Ashcroft said in a statement that Missouri courts “refused to allow the truth to be known. The Western District essentially approved the language that was entirely rewritten by Judge Beetem. Not only is the language misleading but it is categorically false. The circuit court’s opinion admits the real issue is about abortion. The Western District today continued to gloss over the issue in its affirmation. We stand by our language and believe it fairly and accurately reflects the scope and magnitude of each petition.”

Bailey also said in a statement that he disagreed with the decision.

“We remain undeterred in our fight to protect the health and safety of women and children from the radical abortion activists working to turn Missouri into California,” Bailey said.

The appeals court ruling will likely guide litigation over similar language Ashcroft applied to proposals seeking to add rape and incest exceptions to the state’s abortion ban. Those ballot titles, on proposals pitched as a middle ground between the ban currently in place and more expansive rights included in the Fitz-James initiatives, are being challenged in a lawsuit filed last week.

Abortion became illegal in Missouri in June 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a constitutional right to abortion. The only exception is for emergency abortions to save the life of the mother or when there is “a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.”

In its ruling, the court of appeals upheld only one aspect of Ashcroft’s original ballot title – that the proposals would bar the government from discriminating against individuals or organizations that support reproductive rights or provide reproductive services.

The court restored the language, substituting “reproductive services” for “abortion” in Ashcroft’s sentence because “the Secretary’s singular focus on abortion in addressing the nondiscrimination provisions is, as previously noted, misleading.”

In upholding Beetem’s decision to rewrite all the ballot titles, Chapman said he had no choice.

“After removal of the inaccurate and partisan language of the secretary’s summary statements, the circuit court was left with largely unworkable summary statements,” Chapman wrote. “The circuit court was authorized to write alternative language to fulfill its responsibility that a fair and sufficient summary statement be certified.”

In the decision on the fiscal note summary, Judge Alok Ahuja, also writing for an unanimous panel, ruled that Fitzpatrick had accurately summarized the fiscal note. State Rep. Hannah Kelly, R-Mountain Grove, state Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, and Kathy Forck, a longtime anti-abortion advocate from New Bloomfield, filed the challenge, arguing that the state could lose federal Medicaid funding and trillions in future tax revenue.

Their briefs cited no authority that showed Medicaid funding was in danger and Fitzpatrick received no information from state agencies that showed it was likely, the court ruled.

On another point, the panel rejected the idea that Fitzpatrick should have used an estimated loss of revenue from Greene County and projected it statewide. The assumptions used by Greene County were dubious, Ahuja wrote, because they are based on a pure revenue-per-person calculation of local tax collections.

Newborns aren’t likely to have the same spending patterns as adults, Ahuja noted.

“Moreover, despite Kelly’s glib contention that extrapolating the Greene County estimate would be a ‘simple’ exercise, she ignores that sales and property tax rates are not uniform state-wide – nor are the value of real and personal property, or the wealth, income and consumption patterns of individuals and businesses,” Ahuja wrote.

In a statement, Fitzpatrick said he was gratified that his work had been upheld again.

“I oppose these measures and wholeheartedly agree with the other opponents that protecting innocent life is vitally important,” Fitzpatrick said, “but that does not and cannot influence my duty to honestly inform the voters of the state as to their potential costs.”

Sep 18 2023,Indiana AG Faces Complaint Over Abortion Investigation,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/rokita-indiana-ag/2023/09/18/id/1134975,"The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission on Monday lodged a formal complaint against the state's Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita.

The complaint centers on statements Rokita made about OB-GYN Dr. Caitlin Bernard, who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old girl after she was raped.

The controversy began in December 2022 when Rokita publicly announced an investigation into Dr. Bernard. This action came after the OB-GYN disclosed her involvement in performing an abortion on a 10-year-old patient to the Indianapolis Star.

The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, however, contends that Rokita's actions during his investigation violated Dr. Bernard's privacy and were aimed at causing her embarrassment and hindrance. They specifically highlight Rokita's characterization of Dr. Bernard as an ""abortion activist acting as a doctor.""

""And then we have this abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failing to report. So, we're gathering the information,"" Rokita told Fox News host Jesse Watters last summer. ""We're gathering the evidence as we speak, and we're going to fight this to the end, including looking at her licensure if she failed to report it. In Indiana, it's a crime for – to not report, to intentionally not report.""

The commission's complaint outlines three distinct charges against Rokita. The first charge asserts that Rokita violated professional conduct rules by making public comments that could potentially prejudice the outcome of an ongoing investigation. The second charge is based on Rokita's labeling of Dr. Bernard as an ""abortion activist,"" which the commission argues violated conduct rules. The final charge alleges that Rokita publicly discussed confidential information prior to officially filing a complaint with the Indiana Medical Licensing Board, which he eventually did in November.

Rokita had previously faced a reprimand from a judge in December for making public statements before initiating a formal investigation, following a lawsuit filed by Dr. Bernard.

Responding to the complaint, Rokita staunchly defended his actions, emphasizing his commitment to protecting ""vulnerable children"" and their ""privacy rights,"" according to a press release from his office.

Framing his actions as a response to healthcare providers exploiting their media and political notoriety to advance agendas, Rokita added that such ""radicals have fostered an environment that 'cancels' non-compliant citizens through intimidation as well as tactics that can weaponize our respected institutions.""

""So, today, I am filing a response to the complaint also filed today that stemmed from grievances which mainly referenced media reports … Below are highlights from the forthcoming response. My response includes information unreported by the media. Beyond that, I remain responsible for everything my office and I do and say.""

Bernard faced disciplinary action by the Indiana Medical Licensing Board this year for mishandling the 10-year-old patient's abortion information and breaching patient privacy laws. While the board didn't restrict her practice, it marked the event down as her first disciplinary incident.

Despite this, Rokita recently sued Indiana University Health, Bernard's workplace, alleging inadequate enforcement of privacy laws in connection to her abortion care last summer."

Oct 31 2023,"Ashcroft, abortion opponents lose latest round of court challenges to ballot language",St. Louis Post-Dispatch,center,https://stltoday.com/news/local/crime-courts/ashcroft-abortion-opponents-lose-latest-round-of-court-challenges-to-ballot-language/article_7a3e97c6-782b-11ee-a324-837217f829f5.html,"JEFFERSON CITY — A state appeals court Tuesday shot down Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft’s bid to inject political language into a ballot question aimed at restoring abortion rights in Missouri.

Acting quickly on a hot-button issue that has been slowed by litigation, the Missouri Court of Appeals at Kansas City unanimously rejected the gubernatorial candidate’s appeal to reverse a lower court decision to strike and rewrite summary statements for six reproductive freedom ballot initiatives.

As part of his job as secretary of state, Ashcroft is tasked with writing ballot summaries for proposed constitutional changes. A physician sued over six petitions she filed after Ashcroft wrote summaries that she said were biased.

Ashcroft’s language asked if voters wanted to “allow for dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions, from conception to live birth, without requiring a medical license or potentially being subject to medical malpractice.”

In a ruling written by Judge Thomas Chapman, a three-judge panel of the appeals court agreed Ashcroft crossed a line.

“The Secretary’s summary statements are replete with politically partisan language,” Chapman wrote.

Ashcroft also appealed over the way Cole County Circuit Court Judge Jon Beetem rewrote the summaries, arguing that he didn’t include language outlining the dangers of abortion.

Again, the court sided with Beetem, saying his summary was “fair and sufficient.”

The American Civil Liberties Union, which has been handling the case for Dr. Anna Fitz-James, cheered the ruling, which came a day after the case was heard in a Kansas City courtroom with Ashcroft sitting with other attorneys arguing the case.

“Today, the courts upheld Missourians’ constitutional right to direct democracy over the self-serving attacks of politicians desperately seeking to climb the political ladder,” the ACLU said in a statement. “The decision from Missouri Court of Appeals is a complete rebuke of the combined efforts from the Attorney General and Secretary of State to interfere and deny Missourian’s their right to initiative process.”

In a decision in a related case also released Tuesday, a separate three-judge appeals panel rejected arguments seeking to overturn a cost estimate of restoring reproductive rights issued by Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick.

Rep. Hannah Kelly, R-Mountain Grove, and Sen. Mary Elizabeth Coleman, R-Arnold, had favored a fiscal note showing bringing abortion back to Missouri would cost taxpayers billions of dollars.

But the panel disagreed.

“Kelly’s opening brief fails to present this Court with any properly supported legal argument which would permit us to conclude that the Auditor had abused his discretion in discounting the concerns over endangerment of Medicaid funding,” Judge Alok Ahuja said.

Ashcroft, who has been endorsed by Missouri Right to Life as he runs for governor, plans to appeal the ballot summary decision, despite now losing in court two times.

“Once again Missouri courts refused to allow the truth to be known. The Western District essentially approved the language that was entirely rewritten by Judge Beetem. Not only is the language misleading but it is categorically false,” Ashcroft said.

“We stand by our language and believe it fairly and accurately reflects the scope and magnitude of each petition,” Ashcroft added. “My office will continue the fight to preserve an accurate summary for Missouri voters.”

If initiating a series of courtroom delays is part of the strategy to keep the question off the 2024 ballot, it’s working.

Supporters of ballot initiatives must collect 170,000 signatures in six of the state’s eight congressional districts to get a question on the ballot.

As the courtroom fights have continued, no campaign has emerged to collect signatures for any of the proposals submitted by Missourians for Constitutional Freedom in March.

Missouri would be allowed to regulate the provision of abortion either after fetal viability or after 24 weeks of pregnancy under five of the six proposals, the court said.

Missourians for Constitutional Freedom’s October fundraising report showed almost no activity and the treasurer of the campaign didn’t immediately respond to a phone call Tuesday.

Mallory Schwarz, director of Abortion Action Missouri, said continued attacks by the state had delayed the formation of a campaign.

“It is frustrating that any campaign trying to restore access to abortion has been unable to formally come together because the continued attacks by the state have drawn out a process that was supposed to be 54 days to now be some eight months,” Schwarz said.

“They’ve done that with the sole purpose of denying Missourians the right to vote to restore abortion access in our state,” she said.

Other proposed ballot measures

A separate courtroom fight was playing out over a second effort to expand abortion rights in Missouri, a more-restrictive alternative to the slate of proposals that the appeals court ruled on Tuesday.

Jamie Corley, director of Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, challenged the ballot summaries Ashcroft drafted for her proposals in court last week.

Meanwhile, two state lawmakers and a Callaway County abortion opponent filed a lawsuit last week against a fiscal estimate by Fitzpatrick, a Republican.

All of Corley’s six measures would legalize abortions in cases of rape and incest, and three of them would permit abortions through 12 weeks of pregnancy. Currently Missouri only allows abortions in medical emergencies.

The campaign is deciding which version to pursue.

Corley said after a decision is made in the coming weeks, the campaign will set up a committee with the Missouri Ethics Commission and will begin to canvas for signatures.

She said ongoing courtroom wrangling over the final ballot wording won’t stop the campaign from gathering signatures."

Today was the day a ban on most abortions was scheduled to take effect, but it's been put on hold again.

A lawsuit filed by the Indiana ACLU has put the law in legal limbo while the state's Supreme Court considers the newest court challenge.

Indiana's law would prohibit abortions with a few exceptions.

Those exceptions include a pregnancy that endangers the health or life of the mother, a fatal health issue with the baby up to 20 weeks post-fertilization, and in cases of rape or incest, but only up to 10 weeks.

The new law also bans any abortion from being performed at an abortion clinic. If a pregnancy meets the guidelines for an exception, it must be performed at a hospital, or a surgical center owned by a hospital.

The Indiana Legislature passed the new abortion law last August and Governor Holcomb signed it into law. There were a couple of lawsuits that halted the ban along the way, but then the Indiana Supreme Court ruled last month that the ban did not violate the state's constitution.

Now the abortion law is back in the courts.

Sep 18 2023,Rokita faces disciplinary complaint in abortion doctor case,Wish TV,center,https://wishtv.com/news/rokita-faces-disciplinary-complaint-in-abortion-doctor-case,"Rokita faces disciplinary complaint in abortion doctor case

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — The Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission has filed a new complaint against Attorney General Todd Rokita.

The complaint, filed Monday with the State Supreme Court, claims three counts of professional misconduct against Rokita for his handling of the case of Dr. Caitlin Bernard.

Bernard is the Indianapolis doctor who performed an abortion for a 10-year-old rape victim from Ohio last year.

The abortion occurred one week after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and as Indiana considered a new, stricter ban on abortions in the state.

The case drew national attention after Dr. Bernard shared the story with the Indianapolis Star.

The disciplinary complaint alleges Rokita violated professional rules of conduct by discussing the Bernard case while an investigation was underway.

Two of the counts related to a July 13 interview Rokita did with Jesse Waters of Fox News.

The commission claims Rokita violated standards of professional conduct in that interview by referring to Dr. Bernard as “an abortion activist acting as a doctor — with a history of failure to report” before the state’s investigation was complete.

The third allegation relates to public statements about Dr. Bernard and the investigation over a three-month period before the case had been referred to the Medical Licensing Board, violating “the duty of confidentiality.”

Rokita released a statement Monday morning criticizing the commission’s decision to file misconduct charges.

“Hoosiers, in the largest number on record, elected me Attorney General because they knew they were getting a passionate fighter who — like them — is beating back the culture of death, grievance and transanity being pushed by radicals in workplaces, schools, media and government,” Rokita wrote in the statement. “These same radicals have fostered an environment that ‘cancels’ non-compliant citizens through intimidation as well as tactics that can weaponize our respected institutions.”

In a court filing later in the day, Rokita admitted that “use of the phrase ‘abortion activist acting as a doctor — with a history of failure to report’ on July 13, 2022 could Page 26 of 30 reasonably be considered to have violated Indiana Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6(a); nevertheless, should a hearing be necessary, Respondent demands strict proof thereof.”

He also noted that the filing of misconduct charges may violate the separation of powers in the Indiana Constitution.

“Todd Rokita’s actions toward Dr. Caitlin Bernard over the past year brought shame and ridicule upon our state,” Mike Schmuhl, chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party, said in a release. “Rokita is using this office to further his own personal political ambitions, and he tried to silence Dr. Bernard and other doctors — something this commission took issue with in the filing.”

The complaint seeks disciplinary action against Rokita as well as an order forcing him to pay the costs of the investigation.

A hearing date on the complaint has not been set."
Oct 30 2023,Kansas Judge Says State Can’t Enforce New Abortion Pill Law,HuffPost,left,https://huffpost.com/entry/kansas-abortion-pills-ruling_n_6540148be4b032ae1c9c43df,"LOADING ERROR LOADING

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — A Kansas judge on Monday put a new state law on medication abortions on hold and blocked older restrictions that for years have spelled out what providers must tell patients and forced patients to wait 24 hours to end their pregnancies.

The ruling was another big victory for abortion rights advocates in Kansas, where a statewide vote in August 2022 decisively confirmed protections for abortion access under the state constitution. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram’s order suspends some restrictions that have been in effect for years. The waiting period had been in place since 1997.

“The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue,” Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. “Nevertheless, the State’s capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights.”

Jayaram’s order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions.

The legal battle highlights the importance of state courts in attempts to preserve access a little more than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson ended protections under the U.S. Constitution and allowed states to ban abortion. In August, a judge in Texas ruled that the state’s ban was too restrictive, and the Utah Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should lift a hold on a state law there banning most abortions.

Kansas has been an outlier on abortion among states with Republican-controlled legislatures. The state Supreme Court declared in 2019 that the Kansas Constitution protects a right to bodily autonomy and therefore access to abortion as a “fundamental” right. GOP lawmakers proposed an amendment to the state constitution to declare that it doesn’t grant a right to abortion — and in the August 2022 vote, that ballot initiative lost by a wide margin, upholding abortion rights.

Republican lawmakers nevertheless argued this year that “reasonable restrictions” are still fair game. A law that took effect July 1 required abortion providers to tell their patients that a medication abortion can be stopped using a regimen touted by anti-abortion groups. The state agreed not to enforce it until another ruling from Jayaram.

In an August hearing, Jayaram said his reading of medical literature showed that the regimen’s effectiveness is not confirmed by any valid studies. Major medical groups consider the regimen ineffective and potentially unsafe.

Providers also attacked existing laws enacted by GOP lawmakers as a way to ensure patients are properly informed before undergoing an abortion. Patients not only must receive medical information 24 hours before the procedure, but that information must also be in writing and in a specific size and style of type. It must include statements drafted by abortion opponents about fetal development and purported abortion risks that major medical groups consider debunked, false or misleading.

“I’m struggling to see why we’re singling out one specific provider type and one specific service,” Jayaram told the state’s attorneys from the bench during the recent hearing.

Attorneys for the providers have argued that the growing layers of restrictions created a biased counseling scheme designed to discourage abortion. Kansas doesn’t ban most abortions until the 22nd week of pregnancy.

The providers also said challenging older restrictions became more compelling as other states banned abortion and out-of-state residents flooded them with requests for appointments. Kansas saw a 57% increase in abortions in 2022, according to state health department data.

“We feel compelled to get patients who are going to get back in the car for 15 hours medically accurate information because we know they’re scared to talk to providers at home,” Emily Wales, CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told reporters after a recent court hearing.

Abortion opponents argued repeatedly before the August 2022 vote that without a change in the state constitution, all existing abortion restrictions could be at risk. The state Supreme Court is reviewing a 2015 law banning the most common second-trimester procedure and a 2011 law imposing tougher health and safety requirements only for abortion providers. Neither has been enforced because of the litigation.

Attorneys for the state and the anti-abortion Alliance for Defending Freedom argue that in suing the state this year, providers are working against their patients’ interest in having as much information as possible.

“Simply giving a woman information — just like these abortion providers have done for 26 years — that’s not impairing a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion one way or the other,” Denise Harle, an alliance attorney, said following the court hearing earlier this month.

Nov 09 2023,Abortion rights advocates look to replicate Ohio success with more ballot initiatives in 2024,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/11/09/politics/abortion-ohio-ballot-initiatives-2024-election/index.html,"CNN —

Abortion rights advocates have now racked up seven consecutive wins since the fall of Roe v. Wade when voters have weighed in directly on reproductive rights. Next year, they’re hoping to build on that momentum.

The approval of Ohio’s Issue 1, the latest measure to enshrine abortion rights in a state constitution, is yet another sign that abortion is a winning issue for groups gathering signatures for even more reproductive rights amendments in 2024.

The ballot initiative process is not available in all states. But for months, coalitions have been working to replicate a version of Ohio’s amendment in states that allow for such an exercise: from battleground states like Arizona, Florida and Nevada to blue states like Colorado and Maryland to red states like Missouri, South Dakota and Nebraska.

For Democrats, who have made abortion rights a central part of their pitch to voters since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling erased federal protections, the initiatives could help boost turnout among the kind of voters they’ll need in the general election. The increased turnout will be critical to President Joe Biden’s reelection hopes with polls by CNN and others showing him struggling to generate enthusiasm amid deep public discontent over his job performance and the state of the economy. Arizona, Nevada and Florida are also expected to have competitive Senate races next year.

For abortion rights advocates in red states that have enacted severe bans on the procedure, these measures are sometimes the only viable path to restoring abortion access.

The Ohio result is “a signal to keep pushing forward” for groups gathering signatures for abortion rights initiatives, said Chris Melody Fields Figueredo, the executive director of the Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, which works to advance progressive measures.

“When we put reproductive freedom before voters, we win,” she said.

As Ohio demonstrated, winning isn’t just about getting more votes. The coalition backing abortion rights in the Buckeye State first had to defeat a measure aimed at raising the threshold for ballot initiatives to pass from a simple majority to 60%. They also sued to remove what they said was misleading language in the summary of the amendment that appeared on ballots, with limited success. Abortion rights coalitions in other states are facing similar opposition.

Since the Dobbs decision, abortion rights advocates have won ballot initiatives expanding or protecting access in Michigan, Vermont, California and Ohio and blocked attempts to restrict access in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana.

Next year one of the biggest abortion battles could take place in Florida, where the Division of Elections has so far validated more than 490,000 signatures to add a measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, more than half of the total required.

“This was a big win for Ohio, but it also just really buoys Florida’s attempt to get this on the ballot,” said Laura Goodhue, the executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates.

Unlike Ohio, Florida has a 60% vote threshold for constitutional amendments, but advocates say they’re optimistic. Florida voters approved a medical marijuana amendment with 71% of the vote in 2016 and a $15 minimum wage amendment with nearly 61% of the vote in 2020.

The state is also facing its own strict abortion ban. Most abortions are currently banned in Florida after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a six-week ban could soon go into effect, pending a decision from the state Supreme Court. If the court rules in favor of the 15-week limit, the six-week ban signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year will go into effect 30 days later. Goodhue said branches of her organization are preparing for such a ruling to drop any day now.

The ACLU, along with its state-level affiliate in Ohio, invested $6 million into Issue 1 this year. Heading into 2024, the national organization is monitoring efforts in a number of states, including Arizona, where a coalition stated gathering signatures in September for a measure to enshrine abortion access in the state constitution.

“We are really bullish on the prospect of protecting reproductive health in some additional states next year, but we are also very excited to work on elections where the issue of abortion access is front and center,” said Deirdre Schifeling, the ACLU’s chief political and advocacy officer, who cautioned that going state by state via ballot initiatives is a slow process and an enormous undertaking, and only an option in about half of states.

“From our perspective, this is an issue that really needs to be addressed at the federal level,” she added.

Abortion opponents are also starting to push for federal regulation. After Issue 1 passed in his home state, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance told CNN his fellow Republicans in Congress need to change strategy and clearly state where they stand by advocating a federal limit on abortion at 15 weeks. They also need to come up with a strategy to win on the state level, he said.

“I do think, given how big the state ballot referenda are going to be, whether they’re constitutional referenda or just statutory referenda, we’re going to have to figure out how to actually win these things, because this is now the battleground for the pro-life movement,” Vance said.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a news release that the results in Ohio and Virginia – where Democrats expanded their control of the state legislature – “underscore the dire need for a National Defender of Life who will advocate federal protections” banning abortions after 15-weeks of pregnancy. SBA Pro-Life America spent more than $15 million in Ohio this year to block the abortion rights amendment and has been calling on GOP presidential primary candidates to forcefully support a 15-week federal restriction.

“The true lesson from last night’s loss is that Democrats are going to make abortion front and center throughout 2024 campaigns,” the news release read. “The GOP consultant class needs to wake up. Candidates must put money and messaging toward countering the Democrats’ attacks or they will lose every time.”

Sep 19 2023,Indiana AG In Hot Water Over Abortion Comments,JoeMyGod,left,https://joemygod.com/2023/09/indiana-ag-in-hot-water-over-abortion-comments,"Indianapolis’s Fox affiliate reports:

The Disciplinary Commission of the Indiana Supreme Court has filed a disciplinary complaint against Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in relation to comments he made to media outlets and other public statements he made between July 2022 and September 2022 surrounding an investigation into Dr. Caitlin Bernard. According to documents filed Monday, the commission claimed that Rokita violated various portions of the Indiana Rule of Professional Conduct when he spoke about the pending investigation into Bernard to Fox News host Jesse Watters on July 13, 2022, as well as to other media outlets and through public statements from the Indiana Attorney General’s Office.

Axios reports:

State law requires that complaints against a doctor’s medical license “shall be held in strict confidence until the attorney general files notice with the board of the attorney general’s intent to prosecute the license.” In July 2022, Rokita said on Fox News his office was investigating whether Bernard had failed to report the 10-year-old patient’s abortion and sexual abuse as required by law. He called Bernard “an abortion activist, acting as a doctor, with a history of failing to report.”

The Associated Press reports:

Indiana’s attorney general has sued the state’s largest hospital system, claiming it violated patient privacy laws when a doctor publicly shared the story of an Ohio girl who traveled to Indiana for an abortion. The lawsuit, filed Friday in Indianapolis federal court, marked Attorney General Todd Rokita’s latest attempt to seek disciplinary legal action against Dr. Caitlin Bernard. The doctor’s account of a 10-year-old rape victim traveling to Indiana to receive abortion drugs became a flashpoint in the abortion debate days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer.

Nov 09 2023,"After Ohio vote, advocates in Florida and other states want abortion on ballot in 2024",Florida Politics,center,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/643804-after-ohio-vote-advocates-in-florida-and-other-states-want-abortion-on-ballot-in-2024,"After Ohio voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment protecting the right to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care, advocates on both sides of the issue are looking at how they can get support on 2024 ballots in at least a dozen states.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes Ohio, where voters Tuesday enshrined abortion access in the state constitution.

Constitutional amendments to protect access are already on the ballots for 2024 in Maryland and New York.

Questions are being considered for several other states — some to protect access and some to limit or ban it.

Here’s what’s happening in the states. Florida Abortion rights advocates back a constitutional amendment to reverse laws restricting abortion. Abortion in Florida is now banned at 15 weeks, based on a law that went into effect last year with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signature. DeSantis, a Republican candidate for president, this year signed into law a measure to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions to save the life of the woman and in cases of rape or incest. The 15-week ban is facing a legal challenge and, in an unusual twist, if it is upheld the six-week ban will go into effect. The proposed amendment would undo both bans and require that abortion be available until fetal viability, around 24 weeks. To get it on the ballot, supporters are required to gather nearly 900,000 signatures by Feb. 1. Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody has asked the state Supreme Court to keep the question off the ballot, arguing that “viability” is too vague. The amendment would need 60% of votes to pass. Arizona

Abortion access advocates want to amend the state constitution to protect access to abortion until the fetus is viable, generally considered to be around 24 weeks gestational age or later, to protect the life or physical or mental health of the woman.

Supporters have until July 3 to collect nearly 384,000 valid signatures to get the measure on the ballot.

Abortion is banned after 15 weeks of pregnancy, but the Democratic governor signed an executive order in June that bars county prosecutors from bringing abortion-related cases.

Colorado

Colorado has dueling efforts — one from abortion rights advocates and one from opponents.

Neither side has settled on specific language, but abortion rights advocates want a constitutional amendment that would keep the state from banning abortion and would overturn a 1984 amendment that let the government prohibit insurance coverage for abortion.

Opponents want to ban abortion throughout pregnancy. Colorado currently has no state laws barring abortion at any point in pregnancy.

Both sides have until Aug. 5 to gather more than 124,000 signatures. Any measure would need at least 55% of votes to pass.

Iowa

Both chambers of the Republican-controlled legislature have approved an amendment that would declare that there’s no right to abortion in the state constitution. Now it needs final approval in the 2023-24 term to go before voters.

This has been at the heart of legal battles already in Iowa.

The state Supreme Court in 2019 upheld a lower court decision that there is a right to abortion in the state constitution. But in 2022, after membership of the court changed, the court reversed itself.

During a special session in July, Republicans passed a new law to ban abortion after cardiac activity can be detected — about six weeks into pregnancy and before women often realize they’re pregnant. It was in effect for a few days before a court put enforcement on hold.

Maryland

Lawmakers have put an amendment on the ballot that includes the “fundamental right” to reproductive freedom. Abortion is legal in Maryland until viability.

Missouri

Intense court battles have already emerged over proposed ballot measures in Missouri, where abortion is currently banned at all stages of pregnancy.

Abortion-rights advocates are pushing for a constitutional amendment that would bar the government from infringing on a person’s right to reproductive freedom or ban abortion in the first 24 weeks of pregnancy.

Moderate Republicans are working on an amendment that would be less restrictive than the current law, but not allow the same amount of access the other abortion rights groups want.

Backers of both approaches have submitted several versions of their amendments and will each eventually select one to pursue.

To get it on the ballot, they need more than 171,000 signatures by May 5.

In October, an appeals panel agreed with a lower court judge and rejected the summaries of the ballot questions written by Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, who is running for Governor, as politically partisan. Ashcroft said he would appeal.

Nebraska

Abortion rights advocates have submitted language to Nebraska’ secretary of state for a ballot question that would expand abortion access.

The exact language has not been approved or made public.

The state bans abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy in most cases.

At least 7% of registered voters statewide must sign a petition by July 5 to put the question on the ballot.

The secretary of state approved ballot language for a referendum to ban abortion throughout pregnancy with a state law, but the backer of the amendment said he had decided not to pursue a petition drive for 2024.

Nevada

Voters could decide on adding an amendment to establish reproductive freedom, including for decisions about abortion.

A ballot measure pushed by abortion-rights advocates would still allow the state to regulate abortion after viability with exceptions after that for the life and physical and mental health of the woman. The measure would reinforce the state’s current policy that allows abortion up to 24 weeks, but further enshrine it in the state constitution and make it more difficult to overturn.

To put the question on the 2024 ballot, supporters have to gather more than 102,000 signatures by June 26.

New York

Lawmakers have already placed a question on the 2024 ballot asking voters to add “pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care and autonomy” as areas where discrimination would be barred. The measure does not mention abortion by name, though it does seek to protect access in a state where it’s now legal until viability.

Pennsylvania

Republican lawmakers might push to add a question to the ballot to amend the state constitution to declare that it doesn’t grant the right to an abortion, or a right to a taxpayer-funded abortion.

Both chambers of the legislature approved the question once, and would need to do it again to get it on the ballot.

There’s drama around whether that will happen during the 2023-24 legislative session. Democrats currently control the lower legislative chamber with a one-vote advantage. As long as that remains the case, the proposal isn’t expected to pass. But it’s possible there could be a vacancy and special election that would flip control — and potentially give new life to the proposed amendment.

Currently, abortion is legal in the state until 24 weeks’ gestational age.

South Dakota

Voters in South Dakota could be asked to amend the state constitution to roll back the state’s ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy with an exception only for the life of the pregnant woman.

Under a proposed constitutional amendment, the state could not restrict abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. It could in the second trimester, except when abortion is necessary to preserve the life or physical or emotional health of the woman. In the third trimester, the state could ban abortion — except when it’s needed to save the woman’s life.

Supporters have until May 7 to gather more than 35,000 signatures to put it on the ballot.

Judges have told two counties to stop restricting gathering signatures on county courthouse campuses.

Washington

Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee in 2022 pushed for lawmakers to add a question to the ballot to protect abortion access, but so far the legislature has not advanced it.

Currently, abortion is legal until viability.

Nov 08 2023,Abortion rights keep winning elections. But Republican candidates tip-toed around it.,Mother Jones,left,https://motherjones.com/politics/2023/11/republican-debate-abortion-rights,"Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.

It took the GOP presidential candidates more than 90 minutes to address abortion rights during Wednesday night’s televised debate—even though they were gathering just one day after Ohio became the latest state to enshrine a constitutional right to access abortion.

The candidates were forced to acknowledge that voters have resoundingly endorsed abortion rights on the state level all over the country—including in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana—after the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade last year.

South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott was the only candidate on the debate stage who said he would endorse a 15-week federal ban—a position that has become increasingly rare as the Republican candidates reassess their stances in the face of political headwinds, with the front-runner, former President Donald Trump (who, once again, skipped the debate), also refusing to say whether he’d support a federal ban. While running for president the first time, Trump said, “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who received illegal abortions—a statement he later walked back, stating that “the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman.”

The other four candidates seemed to implicitly concede to the reality that, as polls show, Americans overwhelmingly support abortion access. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who during the second debate said he would sign a 15-week ban, appeared to evade reiterating that position, saying instead that he stands “for a culture of life.” (He signed a six-week abortion ban into law in his state earlier this year.)

“At the same time, I understand some of these states are doing it a little bit different,” he continued, adding that Republicans “have been caught flat-footed on these referenda, and they have been losing on these referenda.”

Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie—who said earlier this year he wouldn’t support a federal ban—took a similar position, calling abortion “an issue that should be decided in each state.”

“I trust the people in each country, state-by-state, to make the call for themselves.”

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who previously pledged to sign a federal ban, focused instead on emphasizing that “no Republican president can ban abortions” alone, noting it would also take the support of Congress. When pressed, she said she “would support anything that would pass.”

She said that while she’s “unapologetically pro-life,” she doesn’t “judge anyone for being pro-choice and I don’t want them to judge me for being pro-life.”

And, as usual, Vivek Ramaswamy zigged when others zagged—calling for “sexual responsibility for men,” which he characterized as “the missing ingredient in this movement.” (He has said he’s against a federal ban…but supports six-week state bans.)"
Nov 08 2023,Iowa enters argument in six-week abortion ban state Supreme Court case,The Daily Iowan,center,https://dailyiowan.com/2023/11/08/iowa-enters-argument-in-six-week-abortion-ban-state-supreme-court-case,"Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird filed an appeal to the state Supreme Court on Wednesday, asking the court to reinstate the abortion ban that Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law in July.

The abortion ban was blocked by a Polk County District court shortly after it was enacted in July. Now the bill goes to the Iowa Supreme Court.

The brief comes on the heels of a ballot measure in Ohio that added constitutional protections for abortion access to the Ohio Constitution. The Ohio measure garnered 56.6 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results from the New York Times.

The lawsuit blocking the bill, until it can be closely considered by the courts, was brought by Planned Parenthood, a reproductive health organization, and Iowa abortion providers.

The bill banned abortions after a “fetal heartbeat” can be detected, which is typically around six weeks of pregnancy — much before most people know they are pregnant, experts assert.

The bill included provisions that allowed abortion in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the life of the mother. However, Democrats have criticized the qualifiers for those exceptions.

RELATED: One year post Roe v. Wade overturning, rapid injunction follows passing of fetal heartbeat bill

Under the currently injuncted law, cases of rape must be reported within 45 days of the rape, and cases of incest must be reported within 120 days of the incest. The law also carves out exceptions for miscarriage and fatal fetal abnormalities.

The law only applies to physicians performing the abortion and not the mother’s receiving an abortion.

What’s their case

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said she is confident that the law is on the state’s side and that the Supreme Court will uphold the law.

“No right is more valuable than the right to life,” Bird said in a news release. “Each day, innocent, unborn lives are lost to abortion … I’m confident that the law is on our side, and we will continue fighting to defend the right to life in court.”

The 64-page legal filing lays out the constitutional standards of review that the state thinks should apply to the law.

The filing argues that the court should use the rational basis to review the constitutionality of the law, meaning the state has a rational interest in depriving a right it is constitutional.

Planned Parenthood’s lawsuit argued that the newly enacted Iowa law places an undue burden on women seeking abortion care — the same standard used in Roe v. Wade.

The state’s filing also argued that since Roe v. Wade, the legal precedent that federally protected abortion rights, is no longer law that the court should side with the state and allow the law to be enacted.

The state’s filing also questioned the abortion providers’ legal basis for joining the suit, saying they don’t have a constitutional basis to join the suit.

Reynolds voiced her support for the legal brief on Wednesday in a news release. Reynolds said the legislature spoke when they enacted the law in July and that the law needs to be enforced."
Dec 07 2023,A Texas judge ruled that a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking an abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/12/07/us/texas-abortion-ruling/index.html,"CNN —

A Texas judge ruled Thursday that a pregnant woman who sued the state seeking a court-ordered abortion can legally terminate her pregnancy.

The decision marks a significant development in the ongoing debate over the state’s medical exception to its controversial ban on abortions after six weeks – one of the strictest in the nation.

Kate Cox, who is 20 weeks pregnant, filed a lawsuit this week asking a state district court in Austin court to temporarily block the state’s abortion ban, because she has been unable to get the procedure due to concerns of violating the law. Cox’s baby was diagnosed with trisomy 18 and is not expected to live more than a few days outside the womb, according to the suit.

After the ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton warned Cox’s physician she could still face civil and criminal penalties at some point should she perform the court-ordered procedure.

Cox’s lawsuit is believed to be one of the first attempts in the country by an individual seeking a court-ordered abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, according to the New York Times.

Cox, 31, has been to three different emergency rooms in the last month due to severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks, according to her suit. She has had two prior cesarean surgeries – C-sections – and, the suit said, “continuing the pregnancy puts her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

In an emergency hearing Thursday, a judge granted a temporary restraining order against the state that would allow Cox to immediately have an abortion.

“The idea that Mrs. Cox wants desperately to be a parent, and this law might actually cause her to lose that ability is shocking and would be a genuine miscarriage of justice,” Judge Maya Guerra Gamble said. “So I will be signing the order and it will be processed and sent out today.”

Cox and her husband were present for the hearing – which took place over Zoom – and grew emotional at the judge’s decision and could be seen wiping away tears.

Molly Duane, Cox’s attorney, said they are working to figure out “the fastest way to get her abortion care” but will not disclose when for the safety of her client, her family and physician.

Duane said the fight is far from over, as the ruling only applies to Cox and does not “restore access” to abortion to thousands of other women. She called the state’s argument “callous in the extreme,” and said “they don’t care whether people live or die as long as they’re forced to give birth.”

Marc Hearron, an attorney for the Center for Reproductive Rights, added: “This can’t be the new normal. I don’t think you can expect to see now hundreds of cases being filed on behalf of patients. It’s not realistic.”

Paxton, in the letter threatening future legal action, wrote that Cox has failed to demonstrate she has a “life-threatening” medical condition related to her pregnancy or that her symptoms place her “at risk of death” or major bodily harm.

The letter was sent to three hospitals in Houston where, according to the Texas Medical Board, Cox’s physician has privileges. It was released to the media by Paxton’s office. CNN has reached out to the hospitals for a response.

The state attorney general warned the hospitals that Thursday’s ruling “will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability,” including first-degree felony prosecutions and civil penalties of at least $100,000 for each violation.

And the ruling, Paxton wrote, does not prevent civil action by private citizens – a reference to Senate Bill 8, the controversial Texas law that allows people to sue those who perform or facilitate an abortion.

Group of 20 women and 2 physicians fight state in separate lawsuits

A lawyer representing Texas argued Thursday that Cox’s pregnancy symptoms did not meet the standard set out by the state for a medical emergency that would allow for an abortion.

Johnathan Stone, special counsel with the state attorney general’s office, said Cox’s doctor made a “subjective” belief that Cox qualified for an abortion, rather than basing her medical opinion on “objective” standards outlined in the law.

The argument over subjective versus objective medical reasons for an abortion is central to the ongoing debate and legal fights regarding the state’s exception rule. Critics argue the rule is vague and unclear – causing doctors, who face a felony for performing an illegal abortion, to refrain from taking action. The state maintains the language in the law is adequate and clear.

Duane argued the state was second-guessing her client’s physicians and saying Cox was not sick enough. Duane works for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has been involved in a separate court battle against the state to seek clarity on the state’s medical emergency exception.

“They have moved the goalposts once again. Now a patient must be about to die before a doctor can rely on the exception,” she said of the state, calling the position “cruel and dangerous.”

CNN has reached out to the state’s attorney general office for comment.

Trisomy 18, sometimes called Edwards syndrome, is a chromosomal condition that can cause heart defects and other organ abnormalities. In at least 95% of cases, the fetus doesn’t survive full-term, and the pregnancy ends in miscarriage or stillbirth, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Many children who are born with it die within a few days, and more than 90% die within a year.

Attorneys for the state argued Cox’s condition – as laid out in the court filings – was not severe enough to meet the state’s medical exception standard and that the judge would be essentially changing the law if she granted the temporary restraining order.

Cox’s gynecologist, Dr. Damla Karsan, has previously said she had a “good faith belief” that Cox falls under the legal exception to the abortion ban, but couldn’t provide the abortion without a court order because she “cannot risk loss of her medical license, life in prison, and massive civil fines” if her belief is not accepted by the courts.

The state allows for abortions after six weeks if a woman experiences a “medical emergency,” which is defined in the law as “a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that, as certified by a physician, places the woman in danger of death or a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless an abortion is performed.”

A group of 20 women and two physicians have been fighting the state in a separate lawsuit over the medical exception this year, arguing the language in the law is unclear and causes doctors to refrain from performing abortions in serious cases due to a lack of clarity in the law.

Before the Texas Supreme Court last week, an attorney with the state’s attorney general office argued the law was clear and that if women with life-threatening medical issues were not receiving abortions, then it should be considered negligence on the doctor’s part.

Cox said that although she has gone to the emergency room three times with severe cramping, the law is too vague to make clear whether an abortion under those circumstances would be legal.

“I do not want to continue the pain and suffering that has plagued this pregnancy. I do not want to put my body through the risks of continuing this pregnancy,” Cox said in a statement released by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit in Travis County.

Cox wrote in an op-ed for the Dallas Morning News that her unborn baby girl was diagnosed with full trisomy 18.

“I’m trying to do what is best for my baby daughter and myself and my family, but we are suffering because of the laws in Texas,” Cox wrote. “I do not want my baby to arrive in this world only to watch her suffer.”

“I need to end my pregnancy now so that I have the best chance for my health, for parenting my children, and for a future pregnancy,” she added.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the likelihood of a fetus with trisomy 18 surviving full-term. Almost all fetuses with trisomy 18 don’t survive full-term, and pregnancies end in miscarriage or stillbirth."
Aug 01 2023,Protesters decry Indiana's abortion ban,The Times of Northwest Indiana,center,https://nwitimes.com/news/local/protesters-decry-indianas-abortion-ban/article_6659feb6-3006-11ee-8f32-e7417dba34b9.html,"CROWN POINT — Sonya Haze was long pro-life.

But then in 1995, in her second trimester, she had a miscarriage.

""I had to go to the hospital and I had to have a procedure because my body could not pass the baby,"" she said. ""There are now states in this country where women in my situation in 1995 are told to go home and wait until you bleed out. Had I done that and I also had to be treated for an infection since I waited for a few days hoping I could still have my baby, had I not been able to get the procedure for my miscarriage, I wouldn't have been able to have my beautiful daughter over there or my son. I could have died. And if you think Indiana won't do that to us, you are wrong. They will make you go home. They will make you bleed out almost to the point of death before they give you healthcare. I'm here for my daughter.""

Protestors gathered across the state to protest Indiana's abortion ban before it went into effect Tuesday. Dozens of demonstrators protested in Crown Point, Valparaiso, Michigan City and across the state.

Indiana NOW, MAD Voters of Indiana, Hoosier Jews for Choice, Indiana Women's Action Movement and Pro-Choice South Bend organized the Stop the Bans rallies, which also took place in South Bend, Fort Wayne, Indianapolis and Bloomington.

Every woman should have the right to control over their reproductive future, Sue Elleuterio said.

""Having three kids in a year drove home to me that every person should have the right to decide what their family structure is going to be and what their family situation is going to be,"" she said. ""Indiana has one of the worst maternal health rates in the country. The people who claim they care about babies and care about mothers do not care about babies and mothers or we would not have one of the worst maternal health rates in the country.""

Protestors waved signs like ""Abortion is basic healthcare,"" ""I'm with her,"" Scotus is illegitimate,"" and ""mandatory vasectomies. Come on guys, let's save lives."" They did chants like ""my body, my choice,"" ""two, four, six, eight, separate the church and state,"" ""get your rosaries off my ovaries"" and ""Pro-life is a lie. They don't care if people die.""

When Judy Katz was in college, one of her classmates went to Chicago to get an abortion before the Roe vs. Wade U.S. Supreme Court ruling established it as a constitutional right.

""I tell you young people do you want us making all your decisions for you,"" she said. ""Young people need to get out there and vote.""

Michelle Ferrell said she was protesting because when she was 13 years old her teacher told her about finding her freshman college roommate dead in the bathroom of a coat-hangar abortion.

""She had bled to death in her college dorm,"" she said. ""So when I was 13 I decided I was going to do whatever I could to prevent this from happening ever again.""

Pam Putzell marched in 1973 for reproductive rights.

""Here I am at the age of 73 and we're still fighting the same battle,"" she said. ""When will be heard permanently? When will our rights be everyone's rights? Anyone of us can have our rights taken away.""

She's an adoptive mother with two sons.

""After 10 years of infertility, we were blessed because two women made their choice. Their choice was to give birth and put their children up for adoption,"" she said. ""Thankfully they did and thankfully I'm a mom. I appreciate the people who have the courage to do that and the ability to do that but not everyone does. That's why we need this. Everyone needs to be able to make their choice, whether that's adoption or abortion. It's our choice. My body, my choice.""

Alex Dyonzak had a friend who became pregnant at the age of 15.

""Her family did not support her. Being the older one of her friends, I had to step up and become her only support system, which was a lot for a 17-year-old to do. She couldn't seek help in Indiana because she was past 20 weeks unknowingly. Her abuser wanted her to keep the baby even though she did not. As a healthcare professional today, it's scary to see what we are going through as women. It frightens me to death to think about the challenges we have to face. It's very important we are able to seek any sort of healthcare we need. This new law is going to put us all in danger.""

State Rep. Carolyn Jackson said women and girls are in great danger.

""I heard nine hours of testimony where mothers, physicians and healthcare workers spoke against this bill. Unfortunately, it fell on deaf ears. We stood before the general assembly and stated this bill was dangerous. It's still dangerous. Nothing has changed. I have never seen so many legislators crying and begging their colleagues to do the right thing. This is an issue between a woman, her family and her medical doctor. If I were in this situation, I would want my doctor to help me make the right decision. Not a legislator. Not an old grey-haired legislator who hasn't got a clue about what types of medical emergencies women go through. When a woman is sick in the hospital with an emergency, the last person she would think of calling is her legislator.""

Janine Harrison said the state law would be especially harmful to women with abusive partners seeking independence as abusers often see pregnancy as a way to control and keep their partners.

""When a person who is abused leaves their abuser, it's the most dangerous time for them and any children involved,"" she said.

Rocky Davis said those concerned with the issue needed to become active, such as by putting out signs or registering to vote.

""Whatever you can do, I hope you'll take the time,"" she said. ""Make the calls. Walk and knock on doors. Talk to your neighbors."""

Some are still mulling over the outcome of legislative races in Virginia on Tuesday and now have thoughts about long-term implications — particularly from the pro-life standpoint.

“We are deeply disappointed by these results, which serve as a warning sign for the GOP heading into 2024. Virginia Democrats outspent Republicans nine to one on abortion-focused TV ads that mischaracterized Republican candidates and distracted from Democrats’ extreme position of no-limits abortion on demand,” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

“These ads inaccurately labeled a 15-week protection for babies who can feel pain as a ‘complete ban with no exceptions,’ While GOP candidates rallied around protecting babies from painful late-term abortions beginning at 15 weeks, they allowed Democrats to dominate the abortion narrative on the airwaves and sow confusion with voters. This is not a formula for success for the GOP,” Mrs. Dannefelser said in a written statement shared with Inside the Beltway.

She is issuing a wake-up call.

“The true lesson from this loss is that Democrats are going to make abortion front and center throughout the election campaigns. The GOP consultant class needs to wake up. Candidates must put money and messaging toward countering the Democrats’ attacks or they will lose every time,” Mrs. Dannenfelser said.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America seeks to end abortion “by electing national leaders and advocating for laws that save lives, with a special calling to promote pro-life women leaders,” according to its mission statement.

‘POLICEMEN OF THE WORLD’

Meanwhile, there’s trouble and discord aplenty, as the situation in one particular nation continues to erode.

Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made that clear in opening remarks at a full committee hearing Wednesday on U.S. national security interests in Ukraine.

“It’s important for this committee, and the American people, to fully understand how Russia’s war in Ukraine affects American security. This is different from simply making the case of supporting Ukraine as it fights for freedom. This is a balancing matter that all of us in national security must work towards. We are not, and we cannot be, the policemen of the world,” Mr. Risch said.

“On the other hand, it is also important that we always keep an eye on what’s happening in other countries, particularly with countries friendly to us and ones who enter into defense agreements with us — it is incredibly important. We all know there’s a number of wars going on in the world. We are not participating in the vast majority of them, but we do have to participate in our national security demands,” he continued.

Mr. Risch also called for witnesses to be “crystal clear with us about the realities on the ground in Ukraine and what a Russian victory would mean for America’s national security and economic prosperity.”

He also asked for clarification about alliances that the U.S. makes, how they influence national security and how America’s reputation affects how those defense agreements are carried out.

FOR THE LEXICON

“The Deterrent Act.”

In this case, “Deterrent” stands for the “Defending Education Transparency and Ending Rogue Regimes Engaging in Nefarious Transactions Act,” introduced Oct. 11 by Republican Reps. Michelle Steel of California and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina.

The bill is also championed by Rep. Elise Stefanik, New York Republican, along with her colleagues from the House Committee on Education and the Workforce — who voted Wednesday to advance the Deterrent Act to the floor.

“This legislation brings necessary oversight and transparency to foreign gift reporting requirements to help colleges and universities across the country counter foreign influence and protect our nation’s students,” a written advisory about the act said.

The bill would slash the foreign gift reporting threshold for colleges and universities from $250,000 down to $50,000, with an even stricter $0 threshold for countries and entities of concern, the advisory stated.

“I am committed to ensuring that our institutions of higher education are not compromised by foreign adversaries that want to see the demise of our great nation,” Ms. Stefanik said in a written statement shared with Inside the Beltway.

“President Biden has allowed foreign adversaries to run rampant and undermine our nation’s interests through our universities. We must ensure that universities are putting the interest of American students first and not allowing foreign actors such as Communist China to push propaganda and steal our research. We must protect our students and stand strong against our adversaries,” she said.

Nov 08 2023,"Biden, Hillary Clinton Crow About Democrat Electoral Victories - It's Abortion, Stupid",HotAir,right,https://hotair.com/karen-townsend/2023/11/08/biden-hillary-clinton-crow-about-democrat-electoral-victories-its-abortion-stupid-n590885,"Tuesday night did not go well for Republicans. There were no big gains for Republicans. Joe Biden’s unpopularity didn’t matter. One issue was on the minds of voters and that issue is abortion.

Democrats are making it clear that they will continue to use their playbook that has been used since the Supreme Court ruled that abortion is a states issue, not a federal issue. Every election since then, Democrats paint their Republican opponents as extremists who would jail women for having an abortion, or completely outlaw abortion, forcing women to have unwanted children.

What is the Republican plan? Does anything change after yet another losing election cycle? Mississippi proved to be the only bright spot. The Governor of Mississippi, Tate Reeves, won re-election against Democrat Brandon Presley (a distant cousin of Elvis) who ran as a Blue Dog Democrat. Reeves used the abortion issue in his campaign and his stance is much like that of Presley’s. Presley is a pro-life Democrat who agrees with the state’s restrictions on abortion. He’s a unicorn in the Democrat Party, though. Reeves is not a popular governor but Presley failed to fire up Democrats to get out and vote. Democrats failed to take the gubernatorial election and that was a major victory among lots of defeats Tuesday night.

Are Republican voters tired of losing yet? Joe Biden is very unpopular and his policies have harmed American families. This is well-known. However, Democrats use the abortion issue to their advantage, just as they said they would when the Dodd decision came down from the Supreme Court. Here’s the thing about Democrats – they band together and go vote when push comes to shove. They unite. Republicans splinter into lots of smaller groups. Republicans snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

Why weren’t Republicans better prepared? Governor Youngkin is popular in Virginia. He hoped to have DeSantis-like success in his state with state and local elections. He did not. Youngkin made the mistake of embracing the abortion argument. He promised that there would be a ban on abortion that would kick in at the 15-week mark, not the 6-week mark that some red states have put in place. A six-week ban is a losing argument for Democrats and Independent voters, and especially among women voters. How many more times must we learn this lesson? A majority of voters are okay with a 15-week cut-off on abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the woman. A six-week ban is seen as too extreme because many women don’t even realize they are pregnant at that stage.

Last night Joe Biden stayed up past his bedtime. He issued a statement in order to brag about the successful effort in Ohio to pass an amendment that enshrines access to abortion and a string of other reproductive rights. This is a big win for pro-abortion voters. Ohio is mostly a red state yet this issue was very important to voters. Republican Governor Mike DeWine opposed it. Democrats are not further emboldened to continue to use abortion as a rallying cry in 2024.

Abortion is legal in Ohio up to 22 weeks. Republicans wanted a six-week ban. The ballot initiative was called “Issue 1” and affirms the right of women to make their own decisions about abortion, birth control, fertility treatment, and miscarriage and pregnancy care. There are still some late-term abortion bans in effect, with the exceptions. Someone on Biden’s staff wrote a statement for him to issue. The self-described devout Catholic pledged to stay the course on abortion.

‘Tonight, Americans once again voted to protect their fundamental freedoms – and democracy won,’ the president said shortly after the results were revealed. ‘In Ohio, voters protected access to reproductive health in their state constitution. ‘Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. ‘This extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans. ‘My Administration will continue to protect access to reproductive health care and call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law once and for all.’

Another happy Democrat after Tuesday night’s Democrat victories was Hillary Clinton. She and Chelsea were award presenters at the Glamour Women of the Year shindig.

Last night, reproductive freedom was on the ballot in Ohio, Kentucky, and Virginia. It won everywhere. Women enjoy having human rights, and we vote. — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 8, 2023

The good news is that Hillary Clinton will never be president. So, there’s that.

The shine from Virginia Governor Youngkin has dimmed a bit today. He campaigned hard to move both the House of Delegates and the state senate under Republican control. That didn’t happen. Youngkin has made big gains in Virginia and voters can see it. However, when it comes to abortion, that is an issue that can sway a voter like no other, even in times like this. I know. It defies logic but it keeps happening.

In a typical cycle, Virginia legislative elections wouldn’t garner significant coverage or voter turnout—no statewide offices were on the ballot, making it an “off-off” year—but all 140 seats in the commonwealth’s general assembly were up for grabs. GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin—whose gubernatorial victory in 2021 sparked early speculations about his future presidential prospects—barnstormed across the state campaigning for Republicans to take full control of the general assembly, drawing outsized attention and significance to the election. Democrats and Republicans funneled more than $150 million into the races—30 percent more than in 2019, the last cycle where the entire general assembly was up for election. Suffice to say, Youngkin’s plan didn’t work, despite his previous electoral success in the state. Not only did Democrats retain control of the state Senate, they took back control of the House of Delegates. With a few races still too close to call, the tallies as of this morning show Democrats with a 21-17 majority in the Senate and a 51-47 majority in the House.

As a pro-life woman, it’s frustrating but the fact is that a majority of voters are standing by a 15-16 week cut-off for abortion, with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. Donald Trump knows it. That is why he slammed Ron DeSantis for signing a 6-week ban in Florida. Trump was roundly criticized by pro-life Republicans. The reality is that this is where the country is on abortion. Democrats have successfully claimed abortion as their winning issue. They will keep doing it for as long as it works for them.

Look for Kamala Harris to continue her college tours to rile up young voters about abortion. Republican candidates have to concentrate on policy issues and what they will do when elected. Youngkin made a fatal decision when he tried to get out in front of the abortion issue. I understand why he went on the offense instead of playing defense on the issue but it turned out that he failed to read the room.

Andy Beshear lives to govern Kentucky for another term as governor. Kentucky Attorney General Cameron was portrayed as a rising star in Republican politics and he may be but he lost this race. A common complaint by pundits is that he relied too heavily on Trump’s endorsement and didn’t project strongly enough what he would do in office. Beshear labeled him a MAGA extremist.

Republicans need a winning message on abortion in all states. Each state’s electorate is different so a general, unified message is tricky. It is something that has to happen, though, in order to win elections again."
Nov 08 2023,Iowa AG Brenna Bird files appeal defending halted Iowa abortion ban,Quad-City Times,not-yet-rated,https://qctimes.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/iowa-ag-brenna-bird-files-appeal-defending-halted-iowa-abortion-ban/article_290c237a-7e96-11ee-8cf4-9f0379adb2a5.html,"Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird on Tuesday filed the legal case her team will present when the Iowa Supreme Court hears arguments around legislation that would prohibit the vast majority of abortions in the state.

A Polk County District Court judge temporarily blocked enforcement of the law back in July — three days after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed it at the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering of conservative Christians — until its constitutionality can be considered by the courts.

Planned Parenthood and Iowa abortion providers sued to stop the law from going into effect.

The order means abortion — for now — remains legal in Iowa up until 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The law prohibits abortions once a “fetal heartbeat” — defined as “cardiac activity, the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart within the gestational sac” — is detected. Doctors would be required to first perform an abdominal ultrasound to detect embryonic or fetal cardiac activity.

The law would change the amount of time that women have to seek an abortion from 20 weeks post-fertilization to as little as six weeks — before many women know they are pregnant.

The bill includes exceptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape in cases reported within 45 days, and incest in cases reported within 140 days. It also includes exceptions for miscarriages, a fetal abnormality that would result in the infant’s death and for when the mother’s life is threatened.

An attorney for Planned Parenthood Federation of America argued in court that the law “unquestionably imposes an undue burden” on Iowans’ access to abortion care and violates their constitutional rights to due process, dominion over one’s body, the ability to “have control over their lives and their futures” and to make their own decisions about their health care.

While the ban contains some exceptions for abortions, Iowa physicians have warned the restrictions do not account for complications that occur during pregnancy, and will hinder their ability to provide necessary care and respond to time-sensitive issues.

In the wake of Iowa and U.S. Supreme Court rulings reversing a fundamental right to abortion, Bird argues a new “rational basis” test now applies in court. To pass the test, laws need only be “rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.”

Bird, in her filing, urges the Iowa Supreme Court to “explicitly adopt this test, uphold the Fetal Heartbeat Statute, dissolve the District Court’s injunction, and render judgment for the State.”

The brief also argues that abortion providers have no standing to sue, given that there is no constitutional right to provide abortions.

""No right is more valuable than the right to life,"" Bird said in a statement. ""Each day, innocent, unborn lives are lost to abortion. We know that every moment counts when it comes to protecting the unborn and are working diligently to ensure the Heartbeat Law is upheld. I’m confident that the law is on our side, and we will continue fighting to defend the right to life in court.""

Reynolds, in a statement in response to the brief filed Wednesday, said “it’s time for the Fetal Heartbeat Law to be upheld once and for all.”

“The injunction placed on Iowa’s Fetal Heartbeat Law has already led to the innocent deaths of children. It needs to end,” Reynolds said. “Every life is valuable and worth our state's protection — no matter what stage of life they are in.”

Iowa Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said Wednesday’s legal filing and statements by Bird and Reynolds “show once again how extreme, anti-choice politicians are out of touch with the will of Iowa voters.”

“A substantial majority of Iowans support safe, legal access to abortion and reject attacks on reproductive freedom in Iowa — and so do Senate Democrats,” Trone Garriott said in a statement.

Jun 13 2023,Abortion providers revise lawsuit challenging North Dakota’s near-total ban on abortions,The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead,center,https://inforum.com/news/north-dakota/abortion-providers-revise-lawsuit-challenging-north-dakotas-near-total-ban-on-abortions,"BISMARCK — A lawsuit challenging North Dakota’s abortion ban has been amended to address a recently passed law that bans almost all abortions except those that threaten the life of the mother or involve rape and incest.

The lawsuit originally was aimed at North Dakota’s so-called “trigger law,” an abortion ban that took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that had established a woman’s right to an abortion.

The North Dakota Legislature repealed the trigger ban law, passed in 2007, and replaced it with what the plaintiffs call an “extreme abortion ban” that “flagrantly violates the North Dakota Constitution.”

The new state law passed earlier this year bans almost all abortions except those for pregnancies that threaten the life of the mother or stem from rape or incest. In the case of rape or incest, the abortion must be performed within the first six weeks.

The amended lawsuit, filed Monday, June 12, in Burleigh County District Court, cites a decision by the North Dakota Supreme Court that determined that the state Constitution implicitly grants women the right to an abortion in certain situations.

The ruling, issued in March, said the North Dakota Constitution grants citizens the “right of enjoying and defending life and pursuing and obtaining safety. These rights implicitly include the right to obtain an abortion to preserve the woman’s life or health.""

That right, the decision added, “necessarily includes a pregnant woman” who “has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.”

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit are abortion providers represented by the Center for Reproductive Health and Gender Justice. The amended lawsuit contends that the new law is vague and confusing for physicians to interpret, endangering the lives of pregnant women.

As a result, the plaintiffs contend, there will be a “chilling effect” that discourages physicians from providing care for pregnant women whose lives are at risk.

“North Dakota officials have proven that they will stop at nothing to take away access to essential healthcare, even defying the state’s highest court to do so,” said Meetra Mehdizadeh, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “This extreme law does nothing to protect people’s health. Instead, it has trapped healthcare providers between a rock and a hard place— uncertain over when they can provide abortion care and fearful that they could face punishment if they do.”

The new abortion law, passed in April, bans all abortions except cases of ectopic or molar pregnancy, cases where the life of the mother is endangered, or cases where a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest is discovered in six weeks.

North Dakota’s recently passed abortion ban was intended to clear up language in the 2007 “trigger law” ban and a 2013 “heartbeat bill, ” following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion, according to state Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg.

Myrdal said she rejects arguments that North Dakota’s ban is extreme, and said women are capable of handling the challenges that go with giving birth, even if it results in hardships.

“They think women are evidently unable of going through this,” she said. “You name it and women have gone through it. Women are strong.”

The bill’s backers worked with groups representing the state’s physicians and hospitals in shaping the law, Myrdal said.

The bill passed with overwhelming support in the Republican-controlled North Dakota Legislature and was signed into law by Gov. Doug Burgum, who launched a bid for U.S. president last week ."

Nov 08 2023,"Led by Cuyahoga, Ohio’s big counties were the difference in passing Issue 1 for abortion rights",Cleveland Plain Dealer,center,https://cleveland.com/data/2023/11/led-by-cuyahoga-ohios-big-counties-were-the-difference-in-passing-issue-1-for-abortion-rights.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio - The unofficial tally from Tuesday’s vote for abortion access in Ohio shows that no county voted more overwhelmingly for the constitutional change than Cuyahoga, and that Ohio’s biggest counties largely carried the vote.

While Issue 1 received 56.6% of the vote statewide, it won in Cuyahoga with 74%. The next closest was Franklin County, which includes Columbus, with 73%.

This was followed by Athens County (72%), and Summit and Hamilton counties (each with 65%). Among these, only Athens, home to Ohio University, is a smaller county.

The influence the big counties had on the outcome can be seen in looking at the vote for the four counties with the largest turnout in the state. Issue 1 won by a combined 520,518 votes in Cuyahoga, Franklin, Hamilton and Summit counties for a combined 70.4%.

This was enough to compensate for the statewide margin of 511,234 votes.

In the other 84 counties combined, Issue 1 only received 49.8% of the vote.

Overall, Issue 1 won in 25 counties and lost in 63.

The smallest support came from Putnam (17%), Mercer (21%), Shelby (24%) and Holmes (25%) counties.

Ohio is the seventh state where voters decided to protect abortion access after the landmark Roe v Wade ruling.

Issue 1 establishes “an individual right to one’s own reproductive medical treatment, including but not limited to abortion.” It also creates legal protections for anyone who helps a person receiving reproductive medical treatment.

It also grants treating physicians the authority to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether an unborn child is viable and grants exceptions for abortions to protect the mother at any stage of the pregnancy.

How does this compare to the Issue 1 vote in August?

Cuyahoga County joined several other counties in rejecting the Issue 1 vote in August’s special election.

August’s Issue 1 was an attempt to amend the constitution to require 60% of votes in the state to be necessary when trying to amend the state constitution, which was a response to abortion access bills like November’s Issue 1. If it passed, it would have meant that 60% would be required for a state issue to pass instead of a simple majority of the popular vote.

This means that at 56.62% of the vote, this Issue 1 vote would have failed should the one in August have passed.

When looking at a map comparing the two Issue 1 votes this year, voter turnout against the amendment requirements and for abortion access are nearly the same.

There was some movement among some counties. Some smaller counties increased support for November’s Issue 1 on abortion rights versus rejecting August’s Issue 1.

Guernsey County saw the biggest increase, with 8 percentage points more in November than in August. Fayette County follows with 7.8 percentage points, and Coshocton, Clinton, Carroll and Brown all had an increase of around 6 percentage points.

Some counties did see a decrease, the highest being Lawrence County at a 6.7-percentage-point decrease, followed by Belmont at 5 percentage-point decrease.

Big counties also saw a slight decrease, including Cuyahoga County, which saw a 2.1 percentage-point decrease between the two elections, suggesting some people who voted against abortion access still did not want to see a change in votes needed to change the state constitution.

Newsroom, Nov 8, 2023 / 09:16 am

Virginia Democrats kept control of the state Senate and flipped the state House of Delegates on Tuesday in what will be a major blow to Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s efforts to pass legislation that would ban abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Democrats took slim majorities in both chambers of the Legislature after winning a handful of competitive swing districts.

An effort by Youngkin and legislative Republicans to pass a 15-week abortion ban was a key focus of the rhetoric from both Republican and Democratic candidates. Democrats sought to paint Republicans as a threat to abortion access and Republicans labeled Democrats as extreme on abortion.

Democrats hailed the election victories as a defeat of Youngkin’s proposed 15-week abortion ban."

Nov 08 2023,Glenn Youngkin Bet His Political Future on a ‘Less Extreme’ Abortion Ban and Lost,Daily Beast,left,https://www.thedailybeast.com/virginia-gov-glenn-youngkin-bet-on-a-less-extreme-abortion-ban-and-lost?ref=home,"Up until last night, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin was seen as a probable kingmaker, potential Republican presidential contender, and the future of a party in disarray.

In an election where every seat in the state legislature was on the ballot, Democrats kept their narrow advantage in the state Senate and wrested control of the House of Delegates from the GOP. Youngkin might not have been on the ballot himself, but he is absolutely the election’s biggest loser.

Youngkin ran for office in 2021 focusing on public education—specifically amping up fears about critical race theory (CRT) supposedly being taught in public schools, while also playing off outrage over extended school closures during the pandemic. These were framed as “parents’ rights” issues.

He also wisely made a pointed decision to distance himself from Donald Trump—who was still politically toxic so soon after his attempts to overturn the 2020 election and inciting the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

But Youngkin deftly walked a tightrope to keep from alienating too much of the MAGA base. Youngkin’s secret weapon for victory in 2021 was suburban women (a political euphemism typically used as a stand-in for “white women”), who were mostly not politically extreme MAGA diehards, but were plenty pissed off about schools—and Republicans did everything they could to stoke that anger.

White women voters were so integral to Youngkin’s ascension to power that one Virginia Democratic consultant called the numbers “very sobering.” White women in 2021 swung toward the GOP by 13 points compared to the previous election, and among white women without college degrees, that swing was a whopping 37 points.

The suburban woman vote is a key demographic for both parties and shifts among this group can make or break a campaign—which is what appeared to happen in Virginia’s elections last night.

And the main reason is almost certainly the same one that’s been torpedoing Republican candidates and GOP-backed initiatives since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022. Suburban women, like most women, don’t want to be told what they can do with their bodies.

A poll conducted by the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University released in early October showed 54 percent of Virginians either opposed or strongly opposed Youngkin's proposed 15-week ban on abortion. Youngkin’s approval ratings have been relatively high for much of his term in office, and he has framed his proposed restriction on reproductive rights as a less extreme alternative to the total bans favored by many GOP officials across the country.

But running a campaign on the culture wars at the height of the CRT panic (remember that?) is very different from running a campaign that limits a woman’s reproductive rights, despite ill-founded attempts to make abortion restrictions more women friendly.

Youngkin assumed he could pull a fast one and trick women voters into accepting a more moderate tone on abortion restrictions—which he also saw as a smart strategy for Republicans nationwide. (Youngkin’s abortion ban at 15 weeks included exceptions for rape, incest, and medical emergencies.)

As evidenced not only in Virginia, but in Ohio where voters yesterday resoundingly voted in favor of adding to the state’s constitution an amendment to protect a woman’s right to an abortion, women want to control their own bodies and would like the government to stay out of it. This includes the “suburban” white women who have been so crucial to recent GOP electoral victories.

Youngkin bet his political future—including a possible presidential run—on the idea that he could find a middle ground between “extreme” total bans on abortion and his softer 15-week ban with exceptions. But a ban is a ban, and voters, especially women, are making it clear to Republicans that they don’t see the difference as meaningful.

Will Republicans finally take a hint and keep their policies away from women’s bodies or continue to get annihilated at the polls? The choice is theirs."

Nov 08 2023,"Trump Voters, Evangelicals Helped Pass Ohio Abortion Rights Amendment: Exit Polls",Christian Headlines,center,https://christianheadlines.com/contributors/michael-foust/trump-voters-evangelicals-helped-pass-ohio-abortion-rights-amendment-exit-polls.html,"A bad night for the pro-life community in Tuesday’s Ohio election brought even worse news in exit polling: A significant percentage of Trump voters and self-identifying evangelicals helped carry the day for the pro-choice cause.

It was a down night nationwide for pro-lifers, with pro-life candidates losing not only the Kentucky governor’s race but also the Virginia House, which saw Democrats flip it to take control of both chambers in that state.

But the biggest loss for the pro-life community involved Ohio, where a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to abortion easily passed 57-43 percent. The amendment, known as Issue 1, places language in the Ohio Constitution that declares every individual has the “right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including” abortion.

Exit polls showed that Trump voters were more than twice as likely to support the amendment as Biden voters were to oppose it. For example, although 81 percent of voters who backed Trump in 2020 opposed the amendment, 18 percent supported it. That’s higher than the 8 percent of Biden voters who voted against the amendment. (A total of 92 percent of Biden voters backed Issue 1, according to exit polling.)

Among last night’s takeaways: abortion won big in Ohio’s blue areas, of course. But it also won thanks to support from a lot of Trump voters https://t.co/zLUSwvpW5W pic.twitter.com/Ie3U0zlmoG — Jessica Piper (@jsscppr) November 8, 2023

The takeaway: Biden voters are more unified in supporting legal abortion than Trump voters are unified in opposing it.

Meanwhile, one-fourth (24 percent) of white voters who self-identify as born-again or evangelical supported Issue 1, according to the exit polling. The survey did not probe the beliefs or churchgoing habits of those who self-identify as evangelical.

“Among last night’s takeaways: abortion won big in Ohio’s blue areas, of course. But it also won thanks to support from a lot of Trump voters,” Politico’s Jessica Piper wrote.

Daniel Darling, director of the Land Center for Cultural Engagement at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, said the pro-life community must persuade voters on the Right to oppose abortion.

“It's interesting to me that states like OH and KY, where Trump ran up huge numbers, are giving us these results on the issue of life,” Darling wrote. “I think it shows us that some of Trump's die-hard base, some who voted for him, also continue to vote in favor of abortion. They are animated by other issues, such as immigration and inflation, parents' rights, etc.

A few thoughts about the results in both KY and Ohio, specifically related to the pro-life cause.



First, both are disappointing. We should lament that majorities even in red states often don't see the priority of protecting life in the womb. The end of Roe was just the… — Daniel Darling (@dandarling) November 8, 2023

“This seems to show a clear distinction between pro-life churchgoing evangelical and Catholic folks and unchurched conservatives who vote for Trump,” Darling added. “These are two distinct groups. While we often think our arguments against the sanctity of life are against the left, we need to make arguments to our right to convince them of the sanctity of the unborn. Lastly, we need to not yield in this fight for the unborn. It is a just one. But we also must make arguments designed to persuade.”

NORFOLK, Va. — With 2023's Election Day upon us, abortion is one of the main issues as voters cast their ballots in the Virginia General Assembly races.

It's the first legislative election in Virginia since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to enact restrictions on the procedure. Republicans, who are seeking full control of the state legislature, have largely campaigned on a 15-week ban on abortion proposed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Since the high court's decision, Virginia has become the last Southern state without significant restrictions on abortion. Here's a look at where the laws stand.

Abortion lawful in Virginia during first 2 trimesters

Under Virginia law, abortion is lawful within the first and second trimesters, but the procedure is more restricted afterward.

In the third trimester, the physician performing the procedure has to consult with two other physicians to decide if the continuation of the pregnancy would likely result in the death or impair the health of a woman. Additionally, life support measures have to be used if there's any evidence of viability.

The law states that before any abortion happens, the pregnant woman is required to provide written consent to the person performing the procedure.

When Democrats held Virginia's state government in 2020, they lifted some restrictions on abortion, including a mandatory ultrasound law and a 24-hour waiting period before the procedure.

Republicans have tried to pass abortion restrictions in Virginia

While Youngkin has pushed for a ban, he has said he wants exceptions for rape, incest and saving the life of the pregnant person. He's advocated for this as a middle ground that Virginians can get behind. But the effort hasn't seen much headway in the current General Assembly.

In January, the Democratic-controlled Senate defeated several bills that would have restricted abortion access in the state, including Youngkin's proposed ban. Before the 2023 General Assembly session began, Republican House Speaker Todd Gilbert admitted that movement on the issue wasn't likely this year because of Democratic opposition."
Nov 15 2023,"Emboldened by success in other red states, Nebraska coalition launches effort to protect abortion rights",Los Angeles Times,left,https://latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-11-15/emboldened-by-success-in-other-red-states-effort-launched-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-nebraska,"Protesters line the street in front of the Nebraska State Capitol in Lincoln during an abortion rights demonstration on July 4, 2022.

An effort to enshrine abortion rights in the Nebraska Constitution is being launched, on the heels of successful efforts in other reds states where Republicans had enacted or sought abortion restrictions.

Protect Our Rights, the coalition behind the effort, submitted proposed petition language to the Nebraska secretary of state’s office late last month.

That language was kept under wraps until Wednesday, when the state’s top elections office released it. Organizers plan to hold a news conference Thursday to kick off the effort, in which they will need to collect around 125,000 valid signatures by next summer to get the measure on the ballot in 2024.

“We’re confident in this effort, and we’re energized,” said Ashlei Spivey, founder and executive director of I Be Black Girl, an Omaha-based reproductive rights group that makes up part of the coalition. Other members include Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and the Women’s Fund.

The proposed amendment would declare a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient. Under the petition language, the patient’s healthcare practitioner would determine fetal viability.

The group relied, in part, on polling it says shows a majority of Nebraskans favoring abortion access, Spivey said. That’s proving consistent in other states where voters have backed abortion rights — including in Ohio, where voters last week resoundingly approved an amendment to the state constitution to protect abortion access.

“Ohio was definitely a proof point for us,” Spivey said. “Ohio shows that voters are going to protect their rights.”

Now, advocates in at least a dozen states are looking to take abortion questions to voters in 2024.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that had protected abortion rights nationally, voters in all seven states that held a statewide vote have backed access. That includes neighboring conservative Kansas, where voters resoundingly rejected last year a ballot measure that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban the procedure outright.

Paige Brown, a spokesperson for the Nebraska Catholic Conference that has lobbied hard for abortion restrictions, telegraphed that abortion opponents are aware of the public pushback.

“Nebraska’s major pro-life groups are not pursuing our own ballot initiative,” Brown said in a written statement. Instead, she said, they will focus on defending Nebraska’s current 12-week abortion ban passed by the Republican-led Legislature earlier this year that includes exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the patient.

“The vast majority of Nebraskans agree this is reasonable public policy,” Brown said.

A petition seeking a 2024 referendum to outright ban abortion in Nebraska that was approved earlier this year has been suspended after the lone organizer was unable to raise enough volunteers to circulate it.

Despite indications that further restrictions are unpopular, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen and other Republican leaders have vowed to do just that, even as others have warned it could cost them elections. Republican state Sen. Merve Riepe, who tanked a six-week-ban bill by refusing to end a filibuster on it, took to the legislative floor in April to urge his conservative colleagues to heed signs that abortion will galvanize women to vote them out of office.

“We must embrace the future of reproductive rights,” he said at the time.

Ashley All, who helped lead the effort in Kansas to protect abortion rights, echoed that warning, noting Kansas voters rejected that state’s antiabortion effort by nearly 20 percentage points.

“For 50 years, all we’ve heard is a very specific stereotype of who gets an abortion and why,” All said. “But when you start to disrupt that stereotype and show how abortion is healthcare, people’s perceptions and opinions begin to shift.”"
Sep 14 2023,Push begins to protect abortion rights in Nevada Constitution,KLAS 8,center,https://8newsnow.com/news/politics/push-begins-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-nevada-constitution,"LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A petition initiative to protect abortion rights in the Nevada Constitution was filed Thursday, beginning a long process to approval that could further shield rights already in state law.

Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom announced the effort in a news release that said the effort is being led by Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and the ACLU of Nevada.

Democratic Nevada Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro voiced her support.

“After the fall of Roe, abortion access across the country has been jeopardized. That’s why my Democratic colleagues and I have been fighting to strengthen Nevada’s reproductive freedoms, including codifying the right to an abortion in our state constitution,” Cannizzaro said.

“This is an important ballot measure that gives Nevadans the right to control their bodies — not out-of-touch politicians. I am fully in support of Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom and their coalition’s efforts to put this measure on the ballot in 2024,” she said.

The petition initiative must collect 103,000 signatures by June 2024 to qualify for the November 2024 ballot. If voters pass it in 2024, it will appear again on the 2026 general election ballot for final passage.

The language in the petition initiative relies on a determination of “fetal viability,” which it defines as “the point in pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of an attending provider of health care and based on the particular facts of the case, there is a significant likelihood of the sustained survival of the fetus outside the uterus without the application of extraordinary medical measures.”

A 1990 voter referendum codified the protections for abortion as outlined by Roe v. Wade into state law. That law could be overturned if Republicans gain a majority in Nevada. Putting it into the Nevada Constitution would make it much harder to overturn.

“The urgency of this moment in our nation’s history demands immediate action from us all,” Lindsey Harmon, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, said. “Abortion rights and access in this country are in peril like never before despite the fact that the broad majority of Americans support abortion rights. The fallout of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade has shown us that we have already suffered one year too long without the guaranteed right to reproductive freedom, and we simply cannot afford to stand by and allow any further encroachment on the fundamental right of Nevadans to determine their own reproductive lives and care.”"

The Satanic Temple sued Indiana because the group wanted the state to allow it to provide mail-order drugs for its members in the state to get an abortion.

The group believed the law violated Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act along with the 5th, 13th, and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

The judge ruled the Satanic Temple did not meet its burden to prove there were actual or potential Indiana patients."

Nov 28 2023,"Arkansas attorney general rejects name, ballot title for proposed constitutional amendment to overhaul state's abortion law",Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/nov/28/arkansas-attorney-general-rejects-name-ballot-title-for-proposed-constitutional-amendment-to-overhaul-states-abortion-law,"Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin on Tuesday rejected a proposed popular name and ballot title for a proposed constitutional amendment that would overhaul the state's restrictive abortion law.

A ballot committee, Arkansans for Limited Government, has proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the state from restricting access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception, or in cases of rape, incest, in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant woman's life or health.

Arkansas' current law bans abortions except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency.

The ballot committee's proposed constitutional amendment with a proposed popular name and a proposed ballot title was submitted to Griffin's office Nov. 9. The proposed popular name is The Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment.

The Republican attorney general's options included certifying the popular name and ballot title as submitted, rejecting the entire submission, giving the reasons for the rejection and instructing the sponsor to redesign the measure, or substituting and certifying a more appropriate popular name or ballot title.

Griffin said in the letter to Steven Nichols of Little Rock that, having reviewed the text of the proposed constitutional amendment as well as the proposed popular name and ballot title, ""I must reject your popular name and ballot title due to ambiguities in the text of your proposed measure that prevent me from ensuring that the ballot title you have submitted, or any ballot title that I would substitute, is not misleading.""

The attorney general cited various issues with four sections of the proposed constitutional amendment and three other additional concerns.

Certifying the proposal's popular name and ballot title would clear the way for the Arkansans for Limited Government ballot committee to begin collecting signatures of registered voters in an effort to qualify the proposed amendment for the 2024 general election ballot.

Sponsors of proposed constitutional amendments are required to submit 90,704 signatures of registered voters to the secretary of state's office by July 5, 2024. The total must include signatures from registered voters in at least 50 counties, according to the secretary of state's office.

The Arkansans for Limited Government committee said Tuesday in a news release, ""We appreciate the Attorney General's thorough review of and impartial response to the amendment's language.""

""We are also heartened by the overwhelming support we have received from Arkansans across the state, including pledges to sign a future petition in favor of the Arkansas Reproductive Healthcare Amendment,"" according to the committee chaired by doctor Hershey Garner of Fayetteville.

""Residents want sensible reproductive policy, and Arkansans for Limited Government will begin work immediately with the amendment drafter to craft a revised amendment. We are committed to supporting a ballot proposal that is clear for Arkansas voters,"" the committee said.

The committee filed a statement of organization with the Arkansas Ethics Commission on Monday, listing Garner as the committee's chairman, and attorney James McHugh of Little Rock as the committee's treasurer. For AR People is listed as a member of the committee. For AR People describes itself as a nonprofit organization that advances a responsible democracy in Arkansas by educating the public about issues that have an impact on Arkansans' daily lives.

In a post Tuesday on X, formerly known as Twitter, For AR People wrote that Griffin's rejection of the first version of the proposed ballot title and popular name for the proposed amendment ""is not surprising.""

On June 24, 2022, then-Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge implemented a 2019 state law that bans abortions in Arkansas except to save the life of the mother in a medical emergency, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 landmark ruling that legalized abortion across the country.

[DOCUMENT: Read AG opinion on abortion amendment » arkansasonline.com/1129agopinion/]

Rutledge, a Republican who is now lieutenant governor, certified the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, in accordance with Act 180 of 2019. That in turn certified Arkansas' trigger law on abortion.

The GOP-dominated Legislature and then-Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson enacted Act 180 in the 2019 regular session. Act 180, sponsored by then-Sen. Jason Rapert, R-Conway, is called the Arkansas Human Life Protection Act.

Under Section 1 of the Arkansans against Limited Government's proposed constitutional amendment, the government of the state of Arkansas, its officers or its political subdivisions ""shall not prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception, or in cases of rape, incest, in the event of a fatal fetal anomaly, or when abortion is needed to protect the pregnant female's life or health.""

""Except for the circumstances enumerated in Section 1, the Arkansas General Assembly may prohibit or restrict access to abortion only when it establishes a compelling government interest achieved by the least restrictive means,"" under the proposal.

Griffin said Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment contains at least two issues that prevent him from ensuring the ballot title is not misleading.

One of the issues is that this section may be read in two different ways depending on how the phrase ""access to abortion"" is being used, he said.

""[On] the one hand, you could intend the phrase 'access to' to modify the word 'restrict,' but not the other items in the list. If that were your intent, the provision would prevent government action that would (1) prohibit abortion, (2) penalize abortion, (3) delay abortion, or (4) restrict access to abortion,"" Griffin said.

""On the other hand, you might intend the phrase 'access to abortion' to modify the entire list. If that were your intent, then the provision would prevent government action that would (1) prohibit access to abortion, (2) penalize access to abortion, (3) delay access to abortion, (4) or restrict access to abortion,"" he said. ""But based on the other provisions in your proposal, it seems your intent is to prevent any government action that regulates abortion itself (with the exception of certain conditions in section 2 of your proposal. ... Is your intent to limit government action regarding abortion itself or regarding access to abortion? Under the Arkansas Supreme Court's caselaw, the ballot title would need to describe the nature of the restriction you intend to propose. Because of this lack of clarity, I am unable to say that your ballot title is not misleading.""

Another issue in Section 1 is that the last clause refers to ""the pregnant female's life or health,"" but does not define what is meant by health, he said.

""Is the term intended to cover physical health only or also mental health? If the term is limited to physical health, is that intended to be restricted to emergent medical conditions? Or does the term also extend to pregnancies that increase the risk of certain medical complications? Answers to these questions would almost certainly give voters 'serious ground for reflection.' Therefore, the ballot title would need to inform the potential petitioner or voter about these matters,"" Griffin said. ""Because the text of your proposed measure is unclear on these matters, I cannot ensure your ballot title is a fair summary.""

Among other things, Griffin said the proposed popular name ""is tinged with partisan coloring and misleading because your proposal is solely related to abortion, not 'reproductive healthcare' generally.

""Therefore, in the future, if your propos[ed] measure were at the stage where it could be certified, I would have to substitute and certify a different popular name,"" he said. ""I am flagging this for you now so you can provide an alternative if you would like.""

Griffin also said, ""You have made no attempt to describe your proposal's effect on existing constitutional law.""

""For example, you make no effort to articulate how your proposal would relate to Amendment 68 to our constitution,"" he wrote in his letter to Nichols. ""It seems plausible that even if your proposal were enacted in its current form, portions of Amendment 68 would remain. Since the Arkansas Supreme Court has declared that voters are entitled to some information on how the proposed measure would change current law, some such information would need to be provided.""

Amendment 68 of the Arkansas Constitution, enacted in 1988, states that Arkansas policy ""is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the Federal Constitution.""

Griffin said Section 1 of the proposed constitutional amendment prohibits government action that would 'prohibit, penalize, delay or restrict access to abortion within 18 weeks of conception,"" and this timeframe is keyed to fetal age, which begins at conception.

""But most court cases, medical providers, and most citizens count the weeks of pregnancy using gestational age, which begins from the date of the woman's last menstrual cycle, not from the date of conception,"" he wrote in his letter to Nichols.

""When counting from the more standard starting point, the reference to '18 weeks' is closer to '20 weeks,' "" Griffin said. ""This difference in timing could be misleading to voters and would certainly give them serious ground for reflection. This is not a basis to reject your proposal as misleading. But if your proposal were at the stage where it could be certified, I would have to substitute language in your ballot title to flag for all voters that the timeframe for government regulation would begin at 20 weeks gestational age.""

In a post on X, Rapert wrote Tuesday: ""Thank you @AGTimGriffin for ensuring ballot proposals are truthful and not misleading.""

Regarding the Arkansans for Limited Government committee's proposed constitutional amendment, Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said Monday in a written statement, ""The Left wants the government to play doctor when it comes to gender science experiments on kids and vaccine mandates but apparently draws the line when government prevents the taking of an innocent human life.""

""That's complete hypocrisy -- and disproves their whole claim to stand for 'limited government,'"" Henning said. ""Governor Sanders is proud that Arkansas is the most pro-life state in the country and intends to keep it that way.""

The Arkansans for Limited Government ballot committee responded Monday in a written statement, ""Unfortunately, this rhetoric is what happens when we polarize a personal issue like this. We trust Arkansans to know what's best for themselves and their families. The government doesn't need to be involved.""

In the regular session earlier this year, the Legislature voted to refer to voters in the 2024 general election a proposed constitutional amendment intended to allow state lottery proceeds to fund or provide scholarships or grants to Arkansans enrolled in vocational-technical schools and technical institutes. House Joint Resolution 1006 by Rep. Robin Lundstrum, R-Elm Springs, is the proposed constitutional amendment.

Amendment 87 to the Arkansas Constitution, approved by voters in 2008, limits lottery-funded scholarships and grants to citizens of the state enrolled in ""public and private non-profit two-year and four-year colleges and universities located within the state that are certified according to criteria established by the General Assembly.""

Under HJR 1006, the Arkansas Constitution would be changed to allow lottery-funded scholarships and grants to citizens of the state enrolled in a public or private nonprofit two-year or four-year college or university, a public or private vocational-technical school, or a public or private technical institute.

In the regular session this year, the Legislature opted to refer only one proposed constitutional amendment to voters in the 2024 general election, after voters in November 2022 rejected the three proposed constitutional amendments that the Legislature in 2021 referred to voters.

Oct 26 2023,Satanic Temple loses religious freedom lawsuit against Indiana's abortion restrictions,IndyStar,center,https://indystar.com/story/news/health/2023/10/26/satanic-temple-loses-lawsuit-against-indianas-abortion-restrictions/71326591007,"The Satanic Temple has lost a lawsuit in federal Indiana court that attempted to curb the state's near-total abortion ban.

The Massachusetts-based religious association filed a lawsuit in September 2022 challenging Indiana's newest abortion restrictions by claiming they clashed with the U.S. Constitution and the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which protects religious exercise. The Satanic Temple's religious principles allow members to get abortions.

The lawsuit also argues Indiana's restrictions violate the rights of Hoosier Satanists who may become pregnant if their birth control fails.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita called the lawsuit ""ridiculous"" in a statement Thursday. He said the win ""sustains a pro-life law that is constitutionally and legally sound.""

New documentary:Roe v Wade falls. Indiana overturns a 50-year law. See how it happened in 'First to Act'

“We Hoosiers continue to build a solid culture of life whether satanic cultists like it or not,"" he added.

W. James MacNaughton, the Satanic Temple's attorney, told IndyStar he was disappointed in the decision. It's unknown whether they will appeal.

Federal judge sides with Rokita's office

On behalf of the state, Rokita argued the group didn't have standing to sue because it hadn't presented evidence that there were specific members who would be harmed by the law. MacNaughton told IndyStar Thursday one of the reasons they didn't present anonymous plaintiffs is because of the fear their confidentiality wouldn't be respected in Indiana's anti-abortion climate.

The Satanic Temple launched a telehealth clinic in late 2022 out of New Mexico — called ""Samuel Alito's Mom's Satanic Abortion Clinic"" — but it was never demonstrated that the clinic served its members in Indiana, according to U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Indiana Jane Magnus-Stinson's decision Wednesday.

""A safe, legal way"":More infants are left in this Indiana baby box than anywhere else in the country

The Satanic Temple ""failed to demonstrate that its alleged cost of compliance or threat of prosecution amounts to injury,"" Magnus-Stinson wrote.

""The Satanic Temple had an opportunity to submit evidence,"" but it ""failed on all fronts,"" the judge continued.

The religious association has more than 11,300 members in Indiana. They claim not to worship Satan as featured in Christianity, but the allegorical Satan as featured in the 17th-century epic poem Paradise Lost by John Milton.

Its members follow a set of tenets including the belief that a person’s body is subject to their will and their will alone, according to their lawsuit, and that beliefs should “conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world.”

Indiana's restrictions ban abortion except in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks of gestation, when a pregnancy poses a risk to the life or long-term health of the pregnant person, or in the case of fatal fetal anomalies.

Oct 26 2023,Federal judge throws out Satanic Temple's challenge to Indiana's abortion ban,The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/federal-judge-throws-out-satanic-temples-challenge-to-indianas-abortion-ban,"The Satanic Temple challenged Indiana's abortion ban last September. Like its titular hero, the activist group ultimately failed.

U.S. District Court Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson dismissed the group's lawsuit Wednesday, noting the ""Satanic Temple's allegations fail to prove it has suffered any injury in fact"" and that ""mere indignation"" did not qualify as injury.

Magnus-Stinson noted further that the group had ""failed on all fronts"" to meet its burden of proving causation and redressability, despite having been given ample opportunities to provide evidence and cure its ""standing defects.""

State Sen. Susan Glick (R) introduced Senate Bill 1 in July 2022. The legislation, which was ratified the next month, prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest, fetal abnormalities, or when the mother's life is at risk.

Despite the best efforts of the ACLU and Planned Parenthood to thwart the will of the people and a temporary block, the law went into force on Aug. 21, 2023. However, it still faced at least one more challenge.

In September 2022, the Satanic Temple filed a lawsuit against Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and state Attorney General Todd Rokita.

The Satanic Temple is an atheistic leftist organization that has sought to ensure that women can legally have their unborn children killed by way of their ""religious abortion ritual""; distributed satanic literature to children; publicly performed ""unbaptisms""; held a demonization ceremony in protest of the canonization of the Catholic Spanish priest Junípero Serra; and erected statues of Baphomet on government property.

The temple also runs an online clinic out of New Mexico that distributes abortion drugs, which they've dubbed ""Samuel Alito's Mom's Satanic Abortion Clinic.""

The Satanic Temple, based in Massachusetts, alleged in its complaint that its pregnant members ""believe the fetal tissue they carry in their uterus – from conception until viability – is part of their body and not imbued with any humanity or existence separate and apart from that of the Involuntarily Pregnant Woman herself.""

According to the complaint, the pro-life law violates the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act by preventing its female members from engaging ""in the Satanic Abortion Ritual,"" a ""destructive ritual"" in which women are encouraged to read the group's tenets aloud while killing the children within them.

The group further claimed that S.B. 1 violated the Fifth Amendment by taking its members' uteri; the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against rape and incest victims who become pregnant; and the Thirteenth Amendment, likening pregnancy to slavery.

The activists sought in particular to provide mail-order abortifacients to its members in Indiana, of which there are allegedly over 11,000.

Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson agreed with Gov. Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Rokita that the temple had failed to demonstrate injury in fact, causation, and redressability. After all, the Satanic Temple did not even operate an abortion clinic in the state and could point to no specific concrete instance in which the pro-life law had interfered with its infernal rituals.

""The Satanic Temple has failed to meet its burden to prove that there are actual or potential Indiana patients at all,"" wrote Magnus-Stinson.

The suit has been dismissed and the pro-life law remains in force.

Rokita stressed that this outcome constituted a big win for life and the rule of law, reported the City-County Observer.

""This lawsuit was ridiculous on its face, but this court decision is important because it sustains a pro-life law that is constitutionally and legally sound,"" said Rokita. ""We Hoosiers continue to build a solid culture of life whether satanic cultists like it or not.""

Apr 23 2023,Selective abortion in Armenia,JAMnews,not-yet-rated,https://jam-news.net/selective-abortion-on-the-rise/,"Selective abortions on the rise

In Armenia about 80,000 girls have not been born over the past 30 years due to selective abortion, according to Minister of Health Anahit Avanesyan.

“In order to have a healthy and stable society, we need the sex ratio of newborns to be natural, without any artificial interference. We see the catastrophic demographic consequences that have occurred in other countries, and we do not want a repeat of this situation in our country,” she said.

According to the minister, until 2020 an improvement in this respect was observed in Armenia, but after the Karabakh war the situation changed.

“I couldn’t make this decision alone and give birth to girls”

Forty-year-old Anna Mkrtchyan (name changed) regularly resorted to the help of doctors in order to terminate the pregnancies over twenty years of marriage, as her family expected her to give birth to a boy. The mother of two daughters, she herself dreamed of having a son. But the dream came true only years later after numerous abortions and consequent health problems.

Now Anna recalls these events with regret:

“But then, many years ago, I could not make such a decision alone and give birth to girls. My husband and mother-in-law were against it, they needed a boy, a son, a successor to the family, who would preserve his father’s legacy.”

Statistics

Due to selective abortion, the gender imbalance of newborns in Armenia has been far from international norms for many years.

According to the 2021 Global Gender Gap Report, this figure in Armenia is the highest in the region. Among 153 countries, Armenia is at 98th place, Georgia 74th, Azerbaijan 94th.

According to local statistics, the highest level of gender imbalance in Armenia was in 2000, with 120 boys per 100 girls.

In subsequent years this figure gradually decreased, reaching a ratio of 110 boys to 100 girls in 2020.

In post-war 2021, the lowest rate in recent years was recorded — 109 boys per 100 girls.

But in 2022, the gender imbalance of newborns in Armenia widened again, with 112 boys per 100 girls, whereas the sex ratio of newborns globally is 104-106 boys per 100 girls.

What exactly caused the growth of the gender imbalance index in 2022, experts cannot yet say.

“According to the data of 2022, we have a regression, the reasons for which have not yet been investigated,” the Ministry of Health responded to a request from JAMnews.

Demographer Artak Markosyan says the 2022 regression was unexpected:

“Since 2014 the gender imbalance index has been gradually, smoothly decreasing and has come close enough to international standards. I think the gap between 2021 and 2022 is impressive. And although now it is difficult to talk about all the reasons that led to such figures, I think the growth was due, among other things, to selective abortion.”

Expected result for 2023 i’elusive’

The Ministries of Health and Welfare are jointly undertaking a program to prevent discriminatory fetal sex selection for 2020-2023. It indicates the expected result of the sex ratio of newborns of 107 per 100 by 2023. Based on figures for 2022, the Ministry of Health believes that this indicator is “difficult to achieve”.

Zaruhi Tonoyan, Program Coordinator of the UN Population Fund’s Combating Gender Discrimination Program also considers this unrealistic:

“Unfortunately, we are seeing an increase in the gender imbalance index, and I do not think that we will be able to reach the ratio of 107/100. If we can return at least to the numbers of 2021, this will be a good result.”

In 2022, with the support of the European Union and the United Nations Population Fund, a study was conducted on the reasons for the “discriminatory choice of the sex of the fetus in Armenia”. And it turned out that the number of people who prefer the birth of boys has increased dramatically.

While in 2017, according to the results of a similar study, 38% of respondents said that people in their environment prefer boys, and in 2022 this figure was 53%.

Why do Armenians prefer boys?

In the same 2022 study, when asked why sons are preferred in the family, respondents answered:

91% – “the son is the successor of the family”,

83% – “the son is the defender of the motherland”,

67% – “the son is the heir to the property.”

According to a similar study in 2017 by the United Nations Population Fund:

64% – “the son is the successor of the family”,

33% – “son is the heir to property”,

17% – “the son is the defender of the motherland.”

Experts associate the increased percentage of justification “the son is the defender of the motherland” with the war of 2020 and security problems on the border of Armenia that followed it.

“Although we have had security problems for the past 30 years, since 2020 they have worsened. I suppose that this is the reason for the higher rating of male children as defenders of the homeland,” says Zaruhi Tonoyan, Program Coordinator of the United Nations Population Fund.

“Security issues certainly had a major impact on more people responding this way. On the other hand, I think that the post-war emotional background could also contribute to this,” says demographer Artak Markosyan.

Only in Yerevan they treat the birth of boys and girls equally

According to the results of the study, in the Gegharkunik region preference was given to boys (33% of respondents).

Tavush region is the only one where families want more daughters (17%) than sons (13%).

In Yerevan, these figures are equal — 12% for girls and boys.

In 2022, the number of people giving equal preference to children of different sexes has sharply decreased compared to 2017.

“In 2017 56% of respondents gave equal preference to boys and girls, but in 2022 this figure fell to 36%,” Zaruhi Tonoyan says.

What can be done?

Demographer Artak Markosyan believes that if the gender imbalance grows in 2023, a serious study will need to be carried out:

“First you need to understand the reasons, then try to find solutions to reduce this imbalance.”

According to Zaruhi Tonyan, the problem should be attacked at the social level:

“We must emphasize the role of girls in society and in the family. We will not have a problem of preference only when our way of thinking changes and the importance of the child is not determined by gender.”

According to her, many state and international programs are currently underway, but:

“There is a need to introduce more precise monitoring and evaluation mechanisms at the national level, so that these actions can be properly monitored and their effectiveness evaluated.”

She also emphasizes the role of educational programs, the need for close work with primary health care workers, and media and information campaigns.

Oct 13 2023,Ohio abortion ballot measure a signal of voter sentiment heading into 2024,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/health-ohio-abortion-ballot-measure-voter-sentiment-2024,"

Ohio voters will decide on Nov. 7 whether abortion should be enshrined as a constitutional right in their state, the second time they will weigh in on the matter in less than three months. It will offer a road map of the political landscape in 2024, when more state-level abortion-related ballot measures are expected to come before voters.

In August, a precursor Ohio ballot initiative sponsored by anti-abortion advocates went down to defeat. The proposal would have raised the threshold for passing state constitutional amendments from 50% to 60%, but the abortion rights community was galvanized to defeat it.

THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES WHO HAVE DERAILED PAST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS

Now, its successor, the looming Ohio Issue 1, would establish a state constitutional right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions.” That includes decisions about abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care, and continuation of pregnancy. The amendment would also prevent the state from acting to “directly or indirectly burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against” a citizen’s reproductive choices.

It has turned into one of the fall’s fiercest political battles.

“All eyes are on Ohio,” Jeanne Mancini of March for Life told the Washington Examiner. The Buckeye State has been the epicenter of the state-level debate on abortion since supporters of the procedure proposed an amendment to the state constitution enshrining reproductive rights earlier this year.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, effectively eliminating federal protections on abortion, all 50 states have acted in some capacity to limit or preserve abortion rights.

Quintessential swing states, such as Michigan, have joined Democratic-majority states in instituting strong abortion rights amendments. Kansas also adopted an abortion rights amendment into its constitution, shaking social conservatives.

Other strong Republican states, including Kentucky and Montana, rejected amendments that would have constitutionally constrained abortion. So far, at least eight other states — Florida, Arizona, and South Dakota, among others — are weighing abortion amendments for the 2024 election cycle, making Ohio’s vote a harbinger of things to come.

“It’s the first of many ballot initiatives in the next cycle,” Mancini said. “What we’re seeing is some of these pro-life states are moving far to the left of what [Roe v. Wade] would allow through these ballot initiatives.”

Part of Mancini’s concern is that abortion rights amendments turn what should be a matter of legislative policy into a matter of broad-based constitutional authority.

“It’s really moving what I think should be a policy debate and process out of the hands of the people,” Mancini noted. “It’s true that people, yes, are voting, but they’re not voting for candidates. What they’re voting for is language that is often vague and confusing … and these are very expansive, so they’re not your traditional policymaking mechanism.”

Amendment on the Unborn



Critics of the amendment note the state can limit access to abortion after viability, which can begin as early as 22 weeks gestation. But the final decision to abort even past viability rests with a woman and her physician if continuing the pregnancy is deemed dangerous to the physical or mental health of the mother.

Further, because the amendment would be part of the state constitution, it would supersede existing state laws. This includes a six-week gestational limit that is currently blocked by court order. The amendment would also nullify existing regulations on abortion facilities, as well as parental consent requirements for abortions performed on minors.

Protect Women Ohio, a coalition of anti-abortion voices opposed to Issue 1, has stressed through its ad campaigns that the amendment is anti-parent because of its implicit nullification of parental consent notifications. But Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights says that characterization is inaccurate.

“Anti-parent? Wrong,” Gabriel Mann of OURR told the Washington Examiner. “As a husband and a father, I’m supporting Issue 1. Voting ‘yes’ on Issue 1 will stop this abortion ban and put Ohioans back in charge of our families’ personal medical decisions.”

How the proposed amendment will be described on the ballot is a large part of the political fracas leading up to the Nov. 7 vote. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Senate candidate for 2024, wrote a ballot summary that replaced the medical terms “zygote” and “fetus” with “unborn child.”

OURR contended in a lawsuit against the summary that the language “unnecessarily introduces an ethical judgment.” But the Ohio Supreme Court disagreed last month, saying that it did not interpret the ballot summary as undue persuasion of the voters.

Summer of Discontent



Anti-abortion Ohioans suffered a steep loss for their cause over the summer during that special election that would have made it more difficult to pass state constitutional amendments. At issue on Aug. 8 was whether or not to increase the threshold of ballot initiatives to a 60% majority to pass — a measure that pro-abortion rights groups said was an elimination of the “one-man, one-vote” principle and a threat to democracy.

Once a swing state in presidential contests, Ohio now tilts decisively toward Republicans, but with a populist twist. Former President Donald Trump twice won Ohio by about 8 percentage points, and its congressional delegation and state government are GOP-dominated.

Anti-abortion advocates contend that the strong labor union influence, especially in the heavily industrial northeastern Ohio, in part triggered the loss. They say that won’t be a problem this time.

“There were a lot of different ways to think about it in August, and it was never about abortion,” said Amy Natoce of Protect Women Ohio, the coalition of anti-abortion groups against Issue 1. “This November is very different. It says very clearly it is about extreme abortion, women’s health, and protecting the unborn.”

Natoce added, “It was hard to define in August. It’s defined in November. People know what is at stake. They know what they’re going out and voting for.”

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, one of the nation’s largest anti-abortion organizations, said in the aftermath of the August vote that the Republican Party of Ohio failed to market the matter appropriately, resulting in ads coming in too late to affect early voting. Natoce confirmed that her organization would not make the same mistake, having already flooded the airwaves with anti-amendment content.

Both sides have spent a combined total of nearly $25 million, with the anti-abortion lobby spending nearly $4 million more than supporters of Issue 1.

Early voting in Ohio started on Oct. 11. The weekend before, over 5,000 Ohioans gathered in the capital on Oct. 6 to hear religious leaders such as Bishop of Columbus Earl Fernandes and conservative figures such as Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) at the second annual Ohio March for Life.

Mancini told the Washington Examiner ahead of the march that the event was scheduled before the successful placement of the amendment on the ballot, making it a fortuitous coincidence.

“We will do everything we can possibly do [at the march] to rally the grassroots in Ohio to pro-life grassroots and motivate, motivate, motivate so that people will get out and vote to protect the culture of life in Ohio,” Mancini said."

Feb 13 2024,"New gun, abortion and labor laws take effect in Michigan",Detroit Free Press,left,https://freep.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/13/new-michigan-abortion-gun-labor-laws-take-effect/72576434007,"New Michigan laws approved by Democrats take effect Tuesday, ushering in changes to a slew of policies from labor to abortion rights.

These laws received little or no Republican support in the state Legislature. For laws to take effect immediately after the governor signs the legislation, at least six GOP votes in the state Senate are needed under the current partisan makeup of the chamber. The Democratic bills didn't meet that threshold, meaning they instead went into effect 90 days after lawmakers adjourned their legislative session last year early.

Last year Democrats held a ""trifecta"" for the first time in forty years with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's reelection and the party holding majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature.

Here's a look at the new laws they crafted wielding that power.

Right-to-work repeal and prevailing wage reinstated

On a party-line vote, Democrats repealed Michigan's ""right-to-work"" law that had allowed workers in unionized workplaces to opt out of paying union dues. About half of U.S. states have right-to-work laws in place. With the repeal, Michigan became the first state in nearly 60 years to abandon the policy, which is opposed by labor advocates.

Prep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide

The change only affects workers in the private sector because a U.S. Supreme Court decision currently bars the public sector from requiring employees covered by collective bargaining agreements to pay union dues. But Democrats passed a state law that would also repeal right-to-work for public sector workers in the event the court reverses its earlier decision.

Democrats also reinstated a prevailing wage law requiring union-level wages and benefits for state-funded construction projects.

Expanding abortion access

Michigan has a new ""Reproductive Health Act"" aimed at reducing barriers to abortion access. That includes the repeal of an abortion insurance law that had required the purchase of a special rider to cover abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Democrats removed other abortion restrictions such as a state law that banned higher education institutions' pregnant and parenting services offices from providing referrals for abortion services.

Some state laws Democrats eyed for repeal remain on the books such as a mandated 24-hour waiting period before obtaining an abortion. Abortion rights proponents have sued the state asking the judge to declare the law unconstitutional under a ballot proposal adopted by voters enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution.

LGBTQ+ rights

Democrats have tried for years to expand the state's anti-discrimination law to include LGBTQ+ Michiganders. And last year, they changed the law to bar discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The move came after the Michigan Supreme Court previously ruled that Michigan's civil rights law prohibits such discrimination.

Lawmakers also banned conversion therapy targeting LGBTQ+ youth to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Gun violence prevention

A trio of new gun laws take effect Tuesday: universal background checks for all gun purchases, safe storage requirements to keep guns out of the hands of children and a ""red flag"" law enabling courts to temporarily order the removal of guns from those posing an imminent risk to themselves or others. Whitmer signed the laws within a few months of the school shooting at Michigan State University.

Whitmer also signed into law a temporary gun ban for those with domestic violence convictions.

Education changes

Michigan's public schools will no longer be ranked using an A-F letter system to grade their performance. The rankings had provided a way for parents to evaluate and compare public schools in their communities. Whitmer characterized the system as burdensome red tape for Michigan's schools. The Democratic bill passed on a party-line vote in the state Senate but received bipartisan support in the state House. While the legislation signed by Whitmer repeals the current grading system for ranking schools, it preserves the current index system that also measures school performance.

Meanwhile, Michigan's third grade reading law now no longer requires holding back students who fail a reading proficiency test.

Feb 29 2024,Missouri sues Planned Parenthood for allegedly transporting minors across state lines for abortions without parental consent,The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/missouri-sues-planned-parenthood-consent,"The attorney general of Missouri filed a lawsuit against Planned Parenthood for allegedly failing to get parental consent before transporting minors across state lines for abortions.

Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey called for a court to block the organization's branches in Great Plains from performing abortions to patients from out of state.

“This is the beginning of the end for Planned Parenthood in the State of Missouri. What they conceal and conspire to do in the dark of night has now been uncovered. I am filing suit to ensure it never happens again,” said Bailey.

The lawsuit accuses the group of pulling kids from schools with doctors' notes and then subjecting them to abortions in Kansas before returning them back to Missouri.

“As a father who held my daughter in my arms for the single hour of her life before she died, I know firsthand how important it is to protect life,"" he added. ""Our children are the future. It is time to eradicate Planned Parenthood once and for all to end this pattern of abhorrent, unethical, and illegal behavior.”

He cited evidence gathered in an undercover sting by Project Veritas.

""Planned Parenthood’s most recent unlawful behavior was captured in an investigative video by @Project_Veritas, when Planned Parenthood staff admitted they traffic minors across state lines to perform abortions without parental consent,"" he said.

In the video, a Planned Parenthood employee said they send minors to Kansas for abortions without parental consent ""every day, every day.""

A spokesperson for the abortion provider claimed that the evidence cited by the attorney general was staged.



“This is a press release dressed up as legal action from an unelected attorney general. It is based on ‘evidence’ from fraudulent, extreme anti-abortion actors, who claim to be ‘journalists.’ At this point, we’re relying on the attorney general’s social media posts to review any purported lawsuit, as we have not yet been served and the document does not yet appear to have been filed,"" read the statement.

""We will continue following state and federal laws and proudly providing Missourians with the compassionate sexual and reproductive care that remains available to them in a state with a total abortion ban,"" he added.

Bailey cited numerous other illegal actions taken by the abortion provider in recent years.

Feb 22 2024,Planned Parenthood asks Wisconsin Supreme Court to find 1849 abortion law unconstitutional,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-abortion-ban-lawsuit-planned-parenthood-1518465359ed39a39d38e14a8d97a94e,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin asked the state Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn a 174-year-old state law that conservatives have interpreted as an abortion ban. It’s the second legal challenge to the statute since the U.S. Supreme Court invalidated Roe v. Wade.

The organization filed a petition asking the high court to rule the law unconstitutional without letting any lower courts rule first. And if the justices do so, Planned Parenthood will consider challenging other restrictions on abortion found throughout state law, including bans based on fetal viability and parental consent mandates, according to the organization’s chief strategy officer Michelle Velasquez.

“This petition is really asking whether the Constitution protects access to abortion,” Velasquez said during a video news conference. “We’re asking the court to basically say laws related to abortion would be subject to the highest level of scrutiny.”

The Supreme Court has not said whether it will accept the case, or the related appeal of a lower court ruling won by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul. He challenged the 1849 law as too old to enforce and trumped by a 1985 law that allows abortions up to the point when a fetus could survive outside the womb.

Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper ruled last year that the law only prohibits attacking a woman with the intent to kill her unborn child. The decision emboldened Planned Parenthood to resume offering abortions in Wisconsin after stopping procedures in response to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski, a Republican, has appealed that ruling and earlier this week asked the state Supreme Court to take the case directly without waiting for a lower appellate ruling. Urmanski argued that the case is of statewide importance and will end up before the high court eventually anyway.

Planned Parenthood is seeking a much broader ruling, arguing that the Wisconsin Constitution’s declaration that people have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness means women have a right to control their own bodies. The petition goes on to argue that phrase grants abortion providers the right to practice and means all people have an equal right to make their own medical decisions.

“The right to life and liberty, including the right to make one’s own decisions about whether or not to give birth and medical decisions related to pregnancy or abortion care from a chosen health care provider, is fundamental,” the petition contends. “So, too, is a physician’s right to practice medicine, her chosen profession, and fulfill her ethical obligations of the practice of medicine.”

The petition names Urmanski as a respondent. Urmanski’s attorney, Matt Thome, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the filing.

Abortion opponent Heather Weininger, executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, said in a statement that Planned Parenthood is asking the state Supreme Court to disregard the lives of the unborn “for the sake of their bottom line.”

The stage would be set for big legal wins for both Kaul and Planned Parenthood if the state Supreme Court decides to take their cases. Liberals control the court with a 4-3 majority and one of them — Justice Janet Protasiewicz — repeatedly declared on the campaign trail last year that she supports abortion rights.

Typically judicial candidates don’t comment on issues to avoid the appearance of bias, but Protaswiecz’s remarks galvanized abortion supporters and helped her win her seat."

“Today, I’m proud to announce that the state of Missouri is moving forward with a lawsuit to permanently drive Planned Parenthood from the state of Missouri,” Bailey announced.

🚨BREAKING: Missouri SUES Planned Parenthood after Veritas Investigation Reveals a Conspiracy to Traffic Minors Across State Lines for #SecretAbortions@AGAndrewBailey: “Today, I'm proud to announce that the state of Missouri is moving forward with a lawsuit to permanently drive… pic.twitter.com/VaegYRtZko — Project Veritas (@Project_Veritas) February 29, 2024

Planned Parenthood Great Plains has locations throughout Missouri that provide sexual and reproductive health care, as well as “gender-affirming care” services. Planned Parenthood (PPFA) clinics in Missouri can no longer provide abortion services because the state made the practice illegal after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

The lawsuit comes after a Project Veritas investigation into the Kansas City clinic late last year uncovered a conspiracy to traffic minors across state lines to obtain abortions without their parents’ consent.

“The investigation revealed that Planned Parenthood removes minors from school using altered doctors’ notes, transports them into Kansas for abortions, and then quickly returns them—all to avoid the legal requirement to obtain parental consent,” Bailey said in a press release Thursday.

The Project Veritas undercover video, released on December 21-2023, features Kansas City Planned Parenthood Managing Director “Lashuana” explaining how PPFA will bypass laws to help a 13-year-old get an abortion in Kansas.

“We never tell the parents anything,” Lashuana told the undercover Veritas journalist. “They will bypass without the parents. You just have to make sure you tell them that when you call,” she said. “And we can cut off our letterhead, so it doesn’t even say where she was. Trust me, this is not our first rodeo.”

Lashuana also detailed how the child would be trafficked at no cost to the individuals seeking the abortion.

“They have people that’ll come pick them [minor] up. They have people that will pay for the whole thing,” she explained.

Lashuana told the Veritas journalist that they could also give the child a doctor’s note for school so she would have an excused absence.

“It doesn’t matter if the school agrees or not, we say that she was at the doctor. They have to take it,” she said.

“An agent of a Planned Parenthood clinic in Kansas City brazenly committed to past, present, and future violations of this state’s laws regarding proper parental consent notification, a conspiracy to traffic women out of state for abortions, and a conspiracy to conceal the sexual exploitation of children,” Baily said. “Worse, they admit doing this ‘every day, every day, every day.'”

The attorney general also said that he is is seeking injunctive relief to block the clinic from exploiting more children.

“This is the beginning of the end for Planned Parenthood in the State of Missouri,” Bailey declared.

What they conceal and conspire to do in the dark of night has now been uncovered. I am filing suit to ensure it never happens again,” said Attorney General Bailey. “As a father who held my daughter in my arms for the single hour of her life before she died, I know firsthand how important it is to protect life. Our children are the future. It is time to eradicate Planned Parenthood once and for all to end this pattern of abhorrent, unethical, and illegal behavior.

Baily said the lawsuit is “the culmination of a multi-year campaign to drive Planned Parenthood from the State of Missouri because of its flagrant and intentional refusal to comply with state law.”

The lawsuit laid out Planned Parenthood’s pattern of statutory violations in Missouri:

• In 2018, following at least a half-decade of health-code violations, Planned Parenthood’s facility in Columbia was shut down after staff admitted to having used moldy abortion equipment on women for months.

• Also in 2018, Planned Parenthood physicians conceded in open court that, for at least 15 years, the organization failed to comply with state law requiring physicians performing abortions to file reports when women experience medical complications from abortions.

• In 2020, the Administrative Hearing Commission determined that even though Missouri law at the time required that the same physician who performs an abortion be the one to notify the woman of the risks of abortion, physicians at Planned Parenthood were not doing so.

“It is against the law in Missouri to intentionally cause, aid, or assist a minor to obtain an abortion without parental consent in another state. § 188.250, RSMo,” Bailey stated."

Feb 07 2024,Florida justices raise questions over proposed abortion amendment,Tampa Bay Times,center,https://tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2024/02/07/florida-justices-raise-questions-over-proposed-abortion-amendment,"TALLAHASSEE — Florida’s Supreme Court justices on Wednesday questioned whether a proposed amendment that would restore broader abortion access was “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.”

The amendment would protect abortion until viability, which is estimated to be at about 24 weeks. It would undo Florida’s current ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and negate a six-week ban that lawmakers approved to take effect pending the outcome of an ongoing court case.

But whether the proposal appears on the 2024 ballot hinges on the conservative seven-member Florida Supreme Court.

Attorney General Ashley Moody and anti-abortion groups challenged the amendment, saying its language is misleading and that it would usher in sweeping consequences that would not be clear to the voter.

But the group behind it, Floridians Protecting Freedom, argued that voters are “perfectly capable of reading the language and understanding it.” Whether they like the effects of the proposal would be someone’s decision in the voting booth, an attorney for the group said during oral arguments Wednesday.

The text of the amendment says in part that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.”

Justices grilled attorneys on both sides of the issue, while outside the court, some protesters held up signs urging the justices to “let us vote” while others held placards saying that “Enshrining Abortion in the Florida Constitution is WRONG!”

Mat Staver, an attorney for Liberty Counsel, which opposes the amendment, said the proposal would substantially disrupt abortion regulation, making it difficult for the state to monitor abortion as it does for other health care procedures.

Staver said if allowed to stand, the language would effectively undo any and all abortion laws or regulations that exist, and could tie the hands of the court.

“It’s a total abolition of all the functions of those three branches of government with regards to the issue of abortion,” Staver said.

“You’re saying this is a wolf, and a wolf it may be, but it seems like our job is to answer whether it’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” said Justice John Couriel, who is one of the five justices appointed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. The justices are tasked with ruling whether the ballot language is misleading and whether it deals with multiple subjects instead of only one.

Justices asked Courtney Brewer, an attorney representing the group supporting the amendment, whether voters will have enough information to understand the effect of the ballot language.

Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz at one point said the amendment didn’t seem like it was “really trying to be deceptive,” and said voters could decide if they wanted something more nuanced.

When Muñiz asked if Brewer was saying the amendment was a “wolf that comes as a wolf,” she said yes.

“If voters don’t agree with that they will have the opportunity to vote against it,” she said. “The arguments about what this amendment will do, this is not the time and place for that.”

Nathan Forrester, an attorney for the attorney general’s office, argued that the amendment’s title, which says it would “limit” government interference with abortion, is “understated to the point of deception” and that the ballot summary is unclear as to its effects.

“The people of Florida aren’t stupid, and they can figure this out,” Muñiz responded. “I think there may be a problem as to what it doesn’t say.”

Muñiz, who was also appointed by DeSantis, asked both sides whether unborn children have the same constitutional rights as people in Florida law, and whether that would prohibit the amendment or affect it. Forrester, of the attorney general’s office, said it wasn’t an argument he had considered, and Brewer, representing the amendment, said it wasn’t an argument before the court.

Andrew Shirvell, the executive director of Florida Voice for the Unborn, said he knew the discussion in oral arguments would be difficult but said he was praying for the justices to disqualify the amendment.

He said if the court does not, “it will actually discredit this conservative court that Gov. DeSantis has built.” His group plans to create a political committee to oppose the amendment if it does make it onto the ballot.

House Democratic leader Fentrice Driskell, after the arguments, said she thought the court was not impressed with the state’s presentation.

“The plain language is very clear and a common voter can understand it,” Driskell said.

If the amendment makes it onto the ballot, 60% of Florida voters would need to support it to be enacted. About 1 million voters signed petitions to get the amendment on the ballot during a push backed by groups like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Florida."
Feb 02 2024,Decoding Democrat Joe Biden’s 2024 Abortion Playbook,Breitbart News,right,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/02/02/decoding-democrat-joe-biden-2024-abortion-playbook/,"Killing the unborn is President Joe Biden’s day-one, number-one priority if he is reelected, his staff has said — a strategy likely designed to bludgeon Republicans and appeal to a wide swath of women and young voters accustomed to 50 years of the “right” to abortion invented under the now-defunct Roe v. Wade decision.

The strategy is interesting, given that most overall polling shows the issue of abortion is not Americans’ top priority. But the intense focus is not unexpected, given that one in four Democrats are single-issue voters on abortion and that the majority of independents identify as “pro-choice.” The focus on abortion and painting Republicans as dangerous to women also seems like a ploy to distract from Americans’ top concerns under the Biden administration: the flailing economy and the border, which is essentially open.

In contrast, many Republicans have been eager to shelve the abortion issue going into election season, instead focusing on Biden’s apparent declining mental health, the scandal with his son Hunter, and other various failures. But the GOP should know that in their silence, abortion groups are bankrolling Democrats and corporate media are filling the internet and airwaves with pro-abortion talking points in an effort to keep tight control of the “reproductive rights” narrative going into the election.

Here are five ways self-professed Catholic Joe Biden, 81, is using the issue of abortion as a top strategy ahead of the November presidential election.

“Restore Roe”

Biden, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses, made his first campaign stop in Virginia last week, harping on the issue of abortion in front of a large banner that read, “Restore Roe.”

In June of 2022, the Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision, which overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision inventing a constitutional “right” to abortion and sent the issue back to individual states. Under Roe, a “right” to abortion was established before “viability,” which is generally considered to be between 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Since Dobbs, some states have passed stricter laws regulating abortion, while others, run by Democrats, have loosened abortion laws and appealed to pro-abortion women in red states.

Following the Dobbs decision, the Biden White House and Democrats have called for the restoration of Roe, which would federalize the issue of abortion again. Democrats have repeatedly tried to pass the radical Women’s Health Protection Act, which they claim would restore Roe. But opponents of the legislation, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), say the bill is an “expansion” of Roe and could lead to abortion throughout pregnancy across the country. Biden has pledged to sign the bill should it ever reach his desk.

In the meantime, the Biden administration has arguably become the most pro-abortion administration in U.S. history, working through executive orders, rule-making and guidance from unelected government bureaucrats, and various legal challenges to install its abortion-on-demand agenda around the country and the world.

Biden on abortion: ""Let there be no mistake. The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump."" pic.twitter.com/h27fIQyvBc — The Post Millennial (@TPostMillennial) January 23, 2024

Part of Biden’s focus on restoring Roe includes blaming former President Donald Trump — the likely Republican nominee — for installing three Supreme Court justices who ultimately helped overturn Roe. Trump has touted his nominations and the overturn of Roe as one of his major first-term victories.

“Let there be no mistake. The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden said during his first campaign speech.

“The reason women are being forced to travel across state lines for health care is Donald Trump,” he added. “The reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump.”

“Donald Trump is betting we won’t vote on this issue … He’s betting you’re going to stop caring … that you’ll get distracted, discouraged and stay home,” he said. “Well guess what? I’m betting he’s wrong.”

Threaten a National Abortion Ban

While promising federal action of their own, Democrats and Biden have warned that Republicans would pass a national abortion ban, should a Republican reside at the White House again.

Ever since right-wing extremists overturned Roe, voters have fought back—turning out to win reproductive freedom for their states at the ballot box. But understand this: Republicans are trying to undo all that progress with a national ban. I will keep working to stop them. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 29, 2024

After years of working toward bringing the issue of abortion back to states, some pro-life groups and lawmakers have floated the idea of a national 15-week limit after Dobbs — a limit that would notably allow the majority of abortions to continue but would bar later-term abortions. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) even introduced a bill right before the 2022 midterms.

Republicans in Congress have proposed three national abortion bans just this last year. Make no mistake about it: If Congress were to pass a national ban, I will veto it. pic.twitter.com/uxAKTsErRb — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) August 6, 2023

Some Republican presidential candidates (now ex-candidates) pledged to sign a federal minimum restriction. Trump has not committed to a specific action on abortion if he is reelected. However, he has said the federal government has a “vital role” to play in protecting the unborn and has framed Democrats’ late-term abortion position as “extreme.”

“I want to do what’s right. And we’re looking. And we want to do what’s right for everybody,” he said during a May 2023 CNN town hall. “But now, for the first time, the people that are pro-life have negotiating capability, because you didn’t have it before. They could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born. Now they won’t be able to do that.”

Steal Conservative Talking Points

The “right to choose” is not a new line from Democrats. But the slogan has been repackaged around the country as “reproductive freedom,” while Democrats cast laws that protect the unborn as “government interference” in personal decisions.

As we mark the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, @KamalaHarris, @DrBiden, @DouglasEmhoff, and I are highlighting the stakes of this election and the critical fight ahead against MAGA Republicans’ attacks on reproductive freedom. Tune in. https://t.co/BXh35QGYuO — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 23, 2024

While the Biden administration has no problem coercing Americans to get a vaccine they do not want, surveilling bank accounts, or framing everyday Americans as potential domestic terrorism suspects, the idea of “freedom” and preventing “government interference” is liberally applied to their own political agenda regarding LGBTQIA2S and abortion issues.

.@KamalaHarris and I believe that health care decisions should be made by women and their doctors, not politicians. We will continue to defend a woman’s ability to access emergency care under federal law. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 23, 2024

President @JoeBiden and I believe that a woman should have the freedom to make decisions about her own body without government interference. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 5, 2022

President @JoeBiden and I will continue to fight to protect reproductive freedom and the ability of all Americans to make health care decisions with their doctors—free from political interference. — Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) April 12, 2023

Linking abortion — the intentional killing of the unborn — to “freedom” and “government interference,” is a strategy Democrats and pro-abortion activists have also pushed in state abortion amendment fights around the country since the 2022 midterms.

Left-wing coalitions have paid millions of dollars advertising abortion ballot measures in this framing, along with visuals of family, faith, and American flags waving. The organizations behind these measures also typically outspend pro-life groups by double and triple, often backed by dark money groups.

The strategy has been successful so far, with a string of state-level pro-abortion victories following the fall of Roe v. Wade. Activists in at least nine other states are working to put abortion amendments on the ballot this year, adding more abortion-related fuel to what is expected to be a highly contentious election.

Furthermore, Democrats push the “freedom” narrative while avoiding dialogue around fetal development, points in gestation, or the more gruesome aspects of abortion, which can include the crushing and dismemberment of a baby in the womb.

Create Confusion

Another strategy is lumping elective abortions in with other things like birth control and miscarriages (also medically referred to as spontaneous abortion) under the umbrella term “reproductive health.”

It is a strategy that Democrats have employed since the fall of Roe, some falsely claiming that women will be unable to obtain miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy care or even birth control if abortion is limited.

The Dobbs decision puts at risk the broader rights of privacy for everyone. —The right to make the best decisions for your health —The right to use birth control

—The right to marry who you love The fundamental right to privacy has served as a basis for so many other rights… — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 26, 2024

Poor guy. He left before his soufflé because he decided half the country should risk death if they have an ectopic pregnancy within the wrong state lines. It’s all very unfair to him. The least they could do is let him eat cake ἷ https://t.co/5Y3b1TIW1N — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 8, 2022

On the state level, many abortion ballot measures are framed in this way, giving all people (not just females) the right to make their own “reproductive decisions,” “including but not limited to abortion.” Lumping all reproductive-related issues together gives abortion-related campaigning extra weight, especially among women who believe the narrative and are fearful of being denied necessary care and dying of sepsis.

Point to High-Profile Cases of Women Denied Abortions

Since some Republican-led states have passed abortion restrictions, ongoing high-profile cases have emerged of women being denied abortions in alleged life-threatening situations.

Biden has begun to campaign with some of the women involved in these cases, holding them up as an example of how dangerous Republicans’ abortion laws allegedly are.

Specifically, Biden and first lady Jill Biden invited Kate Cox, who left Texas in December to have her disabled baby aborted, to the annual State of the Union address in March.

On Sunday, @POTUS and @FLOTUS spoke to Kate Cox, who was forced to go to court to seek permission for the care she needed for a non-viable pregnancy that threatened her health. They thanked her for speaking out about the impact of the extreme abortion ban in Texas. pic.twitter.com/i7jDcIug5c — Karine Jean-Pierre (@PressSec) January 24, 2024

In Texas, abortion is outlawed except to save the life of the pregnant woman or prevent serious risk to her physical health, and a doctor can be prosecuted for performing the procedure.

Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, sued the state of Texas with The Center for Reproductive Rights to obtain an abortion after she learned that her unborn baby had Trisomy 18, otherwise known as Edwards syndrome.

Trisomy 18 is a very severe genetic condition that can cause multiple birth defects — 95 percent of babies with the condition do not survive full-term, and ten percent of babies born with the condition typically do not survive past their first year, according to the Cleveland Clinic. There are rare cases of people born with Trisomy 18 living much longer, such as the daughter of former Republican U.S. senator and pro-life advocate Rick Santorum, Isabella, who is now 15 years old. A 2020 scientific journal also describes a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with the condition who has “severe growth and intellectual limitations” but has lived much longer than expected.

The lawsuit alleged that Cox had been to three different emergency rooms within a month due to “severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.” The lawsuit also alleged that her history of having two prior cesarean surgeries meant that continuing the pregnancy “put[s] her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

The complaint argued that it is Dr. Damla Karsan’s (Cox’s healthcare provider) “good faith belief and medical recommendation” that Cox’s circumstances “fall within the medical exception to Texas’s abortion bans and laws.” The lawsuit ultimately asked the court to block the state from enforcing its abortion laws to allow Karsan to abort Cox’s unborn baby.

Ultimately, the Texas Supreme Court halted a lower court ruling in December of 2023 allowing Cox, who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time, to have her unborn baby aborted. The state’s high court blocked a temporary restraining order from Democrat Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the court to intervene.

As to the Texas Supreme Court’s reasoning, justices wrote in part that Dr. Karsan never actually asserted that Cox had a “life-threatening physical condition” or that “in Dr. Karsan’s reasonable medical judgment, an abortion is necessary because Ms. Cox has the type of condition the exception requires.”

“No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn child’s trisomy 18 diagnosis,” the justices wrote.

“Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” they continued. “The exception requires a doctor to decide whether Ms. Cox’s difficulties pose such risks. Dr. Karsan asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”

Cox ended up leaving Texas to have her baby aborted at around 21 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions at that stage of pregnancy typically are done with a dilation and evacuation (D & E) procedure, which can involve “crushing, dismemberment and removal of a fetal body from a woman’s uterus, mere weeks before, or even after, the fetus reaches a developmental age of potential viability outside the mother,” according to the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute.

Before inviting Cox to the State of the Union, Biden was introduced by Amanda Zurawski at his first abortion-themed campaign rally in Virginia. Zurawski was one of five women who sued Texas last year for not being able to obtain an abortion while facing pregnancy complications.

The Biden-Harris reelection campaign also recently released an advertisement featuring Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Texas and mother of three who was denied an abortion in Texas. Dennard narrated the ad and placed the blame for her situation on Trump.

Feb 16 2024,Democrats attack Trump over report that he favors a 16-week abortion ban,Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/16/democrats-trump-abortion-report,"President Biden and other Democrats moved quickly Friday to criticize former president Donald Trump over a report that he prefers a 16-week national abortion ban with a few exceptions, underscoring the extent to which Democrats hope to seize on the issue in November.

Biden’s campaign said the story from the New York Times confirmed their long-held suspicions that Trump would pursue a federal ban after appointing the Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022. Trump’s campaign called the report “fake news.”

“Now, after being the one responsible for taking away women’s freedom … Trump is running scared,” Biden said in a statement. “He’s afraid the women of America are going to hold him responsible for taking away their rights and endangering their rights at the ballot box in November. Which is exactly what’s going to happen.”

The Times reported that Trump has privately told associates he “likes the idea of a 16-week national abortion ban with three exceptions, in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.” Trump’s campaign swiftly pushed back against the story.

“As President Trump has stated, he would sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,” Trump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, without elaborating on such a deal.

Trump’s team was frustrated by the Times story and said no decision had been made on a national ban. One person who has spoken with Trump on several occasions about abortion said the former president repeatedly said he was not going to be tied down to a specific number of weeks. Another person who met with Trump on the issue late last year said he suggested a 16-week ban as a potential plan, but was noncommittal to backing any sort of ban. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.

“He was clear with us when he met with us that he wasn’t going to let them tie him down,” the first person said.

In the meantime, Democrats made the most of the Times story. In addition to Biden’s statement, his campaign held an afternoon call with reporters where his campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, proclaimed that Trump “just came clean.” State parties and Democratic officials in battleground states — including Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — tore into Trump while highlighting the Times report.

The rapid reaction from Democrats showed just how much they see abortion as a winning issue this year, especially as Republicans continue to look for a united message and suffer electoral defeats since the Roe decision. Abortion was one of Democrats’ leading issues in a special election for a New York House seat that they captured Tuesday.

A prominent Democrat with knowledge of the Biden campaign’s strategy — who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal discussions — said they plan to attack Trump on abortion relentlessly this fall, particularly with news clips where he praises the end of Roe, and view it as one of the campaign’s top three issues.

Since the overturning of Roe, Trump has boasted about selecting the judges who helped make the decision, which returned the issue of abortion rights to the states. At the same time, he has publicly demurred on the question of a federal ban and sought to distance himself from some GOP-led states that have passed bans without exceptions. Trump faced some criticism when he attacked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for signing a six-week ban while DeSantis was competing in the GOP primary, but most of the antiabortion community has continued to support him.

Trump has previously emphasized his support for the three exceptions, suggesting the GOP should campaign on them to mitigate its losses. The former president has mocked candidates by name who didn’t say they were for exceptions and has instructed Republicans that they should bring up exceptions before anything else when talking about the issue.

Mini Timmaraju, president and chief executive of Reproductive Freedom for All, told reporters on the Biden campaign call that the exceptions proposed by Trump are “designed not to work, and they’re impossible to enforce in these incredibly draconian states with these extreme bans.” Timmaraju added that Trump was “trying to masquerade as a moderate.”

“We are going to make him own every inch of this crisis he created,” Timmaraju said.

Conservative and antiabortion leaders were taken aback by the Times story because they had been told by Trump he was not going to be tied down and were trying to figure out on Friday if his position had changed, according to two people in the movement.

“He is thinking about a general election,” one Trump adviser said, when describing why Trump has not taken a position on abortion.

“We strongly agree with President Trump on protecting babies from abortion violence at 16 weeks when they feel pain,” SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement.

Trump has repeatedly talked about abortion with advisers and has been pitched on a 15-week ban by figures such as former Trump White House adviser Kellyanne Conway and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). But because he knows it is a tricky political issue, he usually avoids it in public and calls it the “A-word” in private."
Jan 30 2024,"Mississippi, Missouri GOP: No popular votes on abortion access",Christian Science Monitor,center,https://csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2024/0130/Mississippi-Missouri-GOP-No-popular-votes-on-abortion-access,"Legislative efforts in Missouri and Mississippi are attempting to prevent voters from having a say over abortion rights, building on anti-abortion strategies seen in other states, including last year in Ohio.

Democrats and abortion rights advocates say the efforts are evidence that Republican lawmakers and abortion opponents are trying to undercut democratic processes meant to give voters a direct role in forming state laws.

“They’re scared of the people and their voices, so their response is to prevent their voices from being heard,” said Laurie Bertram Roberts, executive director of Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund. “There’s nothing democratic about that, and it’s the same blueprint we’ve seen in Ohio and all these other states, again and again.”

Since the United States Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, voters in seven states have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to curtail them in statewide votes. Democrats have pledged to make the issue a central campaign topic this year for races up and down the ballot.

A proposal passed Jan. 24 by the Mississippi House would ban residents from placing abortion initiatives on the statewide ballot. Mississippi has among the toughest abortion restrictions in the country, with the procedure banned except to save the life of the woman or in cases of rape or incest.

In response to the bill, Democratic Rep. Cheikh Taylor said direct democracy “shouldn’t include terms and conditions.”

The resolution is an attempt to revive a ballot initiative process in Mississippi, which has been without one since 2021 when the state Supreme Court ruled that the process was invalid because it required people to gather signatures from the state’s five previous U.S. House districts. Mississippi dropped to four districts after the 2000 census, but the initiative language was never updated.

Republican Rep. Fred Shanks said House Republicans would not have approved the resolution, which will soon head to the Senate, without the abortion exemption. Some House Republicans said voters should not be allowed to vote on changing abortion laws because Mississippi originated the legal case that overturned Roe v. Wade.

“It took 50 years … to overturn Roe v. Wade,” said Mississippi House Speaker Jason White, a Republican. “We weren’t going to let it just be thrown out the window by folks coming in from out of state, spending 50 million bucks and running an initiative through.”

But Mississippi Democrats and abortion access organizations panned the exemption as limiting the voice of the people.

“This is an extremely undemocratic way to harm access to reproductive health care,” said Sofia Tomov, operations coordinator with Access Reproductive Care Southeast, a member of the Mississippi Abortion Access Coalition.

In Missouri, one of several states where an abortion rights initiative could go before voters in the fall, a plan supported by anti-abortion groups would require initiatives to win a majority vote in five of the state’s eight congressional districts, in addition to a simple statewide majority.

The proposal comes days after a Missouri abortion-rights campaign launched its ballot measure effort aiming to enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution. Missouri abortion rights groups also have criticized Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, saying he is attempting to impede the initiative by manipulating the measure’s ballot summary. A Missouri appeals court recently found the summaries were politically partisan and misleading.

When asked during a recent committee hearing if the GOP proposal was an attempt to get rid of direct democracy, Republican state Rep. Ed Lewis said “I think that our founding fathers were about as fearful of direct democracy as we should be. That’s why they created a republic.”

Sam Lee, lobbyist for Campaign Life Missouri, testified on Jan. 23 for the need for provisions like this that make sure “the rights of the minority aren’t trampled on.”

Democratic Senate Minority Leader John Rizzo said controlling who can vote and on what subjects has been “the highest priority of the Republican Party for the last 20 years.”

Democratic Rep. Joe Adams criticized the plan in part by alleging that the state’s congressional and legislative districts are gerrymandered to favor Republicans. That would make it nearly impossible for an abortion measure to be approved under the proposed legislation.

Attempts to keep abortion measures off the ballot in Missouri and Mississippi follow a similar blueprint in other states to target the ballot initiative process, a form of direct democracy available to voters in only about half the states.

Florida’s Republican attorney general has asked the state Supreme Court to keep a proposed abortion rights amendment off the ballot as an abortion-rights coalition this month reached the necessary number of signatures to qualify it for the 2024 ballot.

In Nevada, a judge on Jan. 22 approved an abortion-rights ballot measure petition as eligible for signature-gathering, striking down a legal challenge by anti-abortion groups attempting to prevent the question from going before voters.

Ohio abortion rights advocates have said last year’s statewide vote to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution was as much about abortion as it was a referendum on democracy itself. They said Republicans tried to obstruct the democratic process before the vote and attempted to ignore the will of voters after the amendment passed.

Ohio Republicans called a special election in August attempting to raise the threshold for passing future constitutional amendments from a simple majority to 60%. That effort was defeated at the polls and was widely seen as aiming to undermine the abortion amendment.

After Ohio voters approved the abortion protections last year, Republican lawmakers pledged to block the amendment from reversing the state’s restrictions. Some proposed preventing Ohio courts from interpreting any cases related to the amendment.

Jan 23 2024,TN lawmaker proposes ‘abortion trafficking’ bill,WKRN News 2,center,https://wkrn.com/news/tennessee-politics/tn-lawmaker-proposes-abortion-trafficking-bill,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – Even though abortion has been effectively banned in Tennessee, one lawmaker wants to take a further step – preventing adults, besides a minor’s parent, from being able to take a minor over state lines for an abortion.

House Bill 1895 would make it a crime for an adult to take an unemancipated minor out of Tennesse for a procedure or bring them abortion drugs.

State Rep. Jason Zachary (R-Knoxville) said he felt a need to introduce the bill after a situation he personally encountered with East Tennessee parents.

“There was a minor who was 14 years old who was pregnant, and steps were being taken to facilitate an abortion for that minor without the parent’s knowledge, and that’s completely unacceptable,” Zachary said.

Zachary added the law would be enforced by people reporting incidents of adults helping facilitate abortions; the case would then be investigated.

Local Planned Parenthood leaders said it would be illegal for an abortion clinic to share information about where a patient lives. However, Zachary did not think that would be necessary to enforce the law.

“It’s criminalizing the helpers of our state; it’s criminalizing the teachers and healthcare providers and social workers and school counselors who may be there to assist a minor in a really difficult situation, and it’s only making a terrible law, the abortion ban in Tennessee, even worse,” said Ashley Coffield, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi.

Coffield called the bill copycat legislation after a similar measure was signed into law in Idaho last spring.

“Before the abortion ban, there weren’t a whole lot of minors in Tennessee who were seeking abortion, but those who were in really desperate situations, and we know that a pregnant person who does not get a wanted abortion, it can have life long, devastating consequences. Studies show that they’re four times more likely to live in poverty; they’re more likely to suffer pregnancy complications, and they’re more likely to stay in an abusive relationship,” she said.

Zachary has introduced the bill, but no votes have been scheduled."

Feb 08 2024,Anti-Abortion Advocate Arrested for Sphere Climb Released on Bond - Nevada Globe,The Nevada Globe,right,https://thenevadaglobe.com/702times/anti-abortion-advocate-arrested-for-sphere-climb-released-on-bond,"Las Vegas, NV – Maison Des Champs, a 24-year-old self-proclaimed skyscraper climber and anti-abortion advocate, has been released from custody after posting bond. Des Champs was set to appear in court for an initial hearing on Thursday, but the hearing was canceled as he had already posted a surety bond, according to court records.

Des Champs made headlines on Wednesday after successfully climbing to the top of the Sphere, an incident that he documented on his Instagram account. His actions were said to be part of a fundraising effort to dissuade a woman from obtaining an abortion, as confirmed by a friend of Des Champs who spoke to the Review-Journal.

The charges against Des Champs include destruction of property, conspiracy to destroy property, and disregarding the safety of persons or property, as stated in court records. This is not the first time Des Champs has faced legal consequences for his actions. Last year, he was arrested for scaling the Aria hotel in protest of COVID-19 related mandates.

In connection to Des Champs’ Sphere climb, three individuals also faced charges. Aaron Hurley (39), Lori Hurley (38), and David Velasquez (25) were arrested alongside Des Champs and accused of assisting him during the climb while filming the incident. The charges against them include disregarding the safety of persons or property, destruction of property, and conspiracy to destroy property. Additionally, Velasquez faces a charge for operating a drone in a manner endangering to life or property, according to court records.

Justice of the Peace Rebecca Saxe released all three individuals on their own recognizance Thursday afternoon. Saxe ordered them to stay away from the Strip and prohibited them from having any contact with Des Champs. While expressing concern about the situation and how Des Champs’ actions diverted attention from other emergencies, Saxe also acknowledged that none of the defendants had a previous criminal history.

During the hearing, it was revealed that Aaron Hurley is an anti-abortion advocate who delivers talks at churches and has appeared on Des Champs’ social media accounts. The judge cautioned Hurley about maintaining no contact with Des Champs during the case and explained the potential consequences if the court’s order is violated.

Saxe emphasized, “If the court finds that you have violated this court’s no contact order, you may be returned back into custody and face additional charges.”

Jan 19 2024,"Anti-Abortion Advocates to Protest in Washington, DC",Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/march-for-life-rallies-abortion/2024/01/19/id/1150180,"More than a year after a generational victory for their movement, opponents of abortion rights are rallying in the nation's capital on Friday with an eye on presidential elections that could be heavily influenced by abortion politics.

Thousands of protesters are expected on the National Mall for an hour of speeches and a march past the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court. But snow and frigid temperatures have been gripping the Washington metropolitan area, which could affect turnout for the march.

Friday's March for Life is the second such event since the June 2022 Supreme Court ruling that ended the federal protection for abortion rights enshrined in Roe v. Wade. Last year's march was understandably triumphant, with organizers relishing a state-by-state fight in legislatures around the country.

That fight rages on, with mixed results. The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization reverted abortion lawmaking back to the states, and 14 states are now enforcing bans on abortion throughout pregnancy. Two more have such bans on hold because of court rulings. And another two have bans that take effect when cardiac activity can be detected, about six weeks into pregnancy — often before women know they’re pregnant.

But abortion restrictions have also lost at the ballot box in Ohio, Kansas and Kentucky. And total bans have produced high-profile causes for abortion rights supporters to rally around. Kate Cox, a Texas mother of two, sought an abortion after learning the baby she was carrying had a fatal genetic condition. Her request for an exemption from Texas’ ban, one of the country’s strictest, was denied by the state Supreme Court, and she left Texas to seek an abortion elsewhere.

Movement organizers now expect abortion rights to be a major Democratic rallying cry in President Joe Biden's reelection campaign.

“The pro-abortion forces, that's one of the major things they're going to run on,” said Susan Swift, president of Pro-Life Legal and a veteran anti-abortion activist. “That's one of the only things that seems to animate their base.”

Biden campaign officials openly state that they plan to make Biden synonymous with the fight to preserve abortion rights.

Vice President Kamala Harris has led the charge on the issue for the White House. She will hold the first event in Wisconsin on Monday, which would have been the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the lawsuit that led to the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion."
Jan 30 2024,Pennsylvania Supreme Court opens the door to public funding for abortion,Catholic News Agency,right,https://catholicnewsagency.com/news/256686/pennsylvania-supreme-court-opens-the-door-to-public-funding-for-abortion,"The Commonwealth Court had previously dismissed the lawsuit in 2021 on the grounds that it was bound by Pennsylvania Supreme Court precedent; the state Supreme Court had previously upheld the abortion restrictions in 1985.

The majority ruling this week found that Pennsylvania’s law barring public funds for most abortions “discriminates against those women who choose to exercise their fundamental right to terminate a pregnancy” and that abortion providers have standing to sue the state over the policy.

The ruling does not immediately change abortion policy in Pennsylvania. Rather, the state Supreme Court ruling sends the case back to the Commonwealth Court for further review. Abortion is presently legal in Pennsylvania up to 24 weeks in pregnancy, or later in pregnancy if the life of the mother is at risk.

Seventeen states use public state funds to pay for abortions, despite a federal policy known as the Hyde Amendment that since 1976 has prohibited the use of federal tax dollars to pay for abortion. States that want to pay for abortions through their Medicaid program could do so using their own funds and are not reimbursed by the federal government.

The Pennsylvania Catholic Conference, which advocates for policy in the state on behalf of the Catholic bishops, said it is working on a formal response to the state Supreme Court’s ruling.

In a brief statement to CNA on Tuesday, Eric Failing, the conferences’s executive director, noted that it is “a complex case with a lot of decisions so we are going through it very carefully.”"
Feb 12 2024,"Voting changes, abortion access and other new Michigan laws take effect Tuesday",MLive.com,center,https://mlive.com/politics/2024/02/voting-changes-abortion-access-and-other-new-michigan-laws-take-effect-tuesday.html,"LANSING, MI — Though Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed off on 321 public acts in 2023, not all of those laws immediately took effect upon getting her signature.

The Michigan legislature, more specifically the Senate, has the ability to grant or deny immediate effect to legislation upon its passage. Should a bill not gain immediate effect, it won’t officially become law until 90 days after session adjourns for the year.

While 2023 marked the most bills passed in the first year of a term since 2011, it also marked the first time in four decades that Democrats controlled all three branches of state government.

More than 140 bills will become law on Tuesday, Feb. 13, some of which act together as part of a package. Here are just some of the highlights.

Major changes ahead of 2024 elections, incoming

Much like with the constitutional requirement for financial disclosure legislation, when voters sounded off on Proposal 2 of 2022 there was an understanding that Michigan’s voting laws would change as well. What that looks like, however, is multifaceted.

Some of these changes – including moving Michigan’s presidential primary to Feb. 27 and allowing absentee ballots from military and overseas voters to be counted if received up to six days after an election – were signed into law separately from the Proposal 2-tied package.

As for what was mandatory, legislation signed in July 2023 will now allow Michiganders to:

Have the ability to track their ballots online, with a state website able to notify voters when/if their ballot is received, whether its been counted or if there is an error with the procedure;

Be able to fill out a single application to vote by mail, as well as have a ballot mailed to them for all future elections;

Have at least nine days of early voting before each statewide and federal election;

Be able to fix clerical errors with their ballots, as well as obtain prepaid postage for all absentee ballot applications and envelopes;

Use several different forms of ID – including a person’s U.S. passport, tribal photo ID card, military ID card or student ID – to affirm voting eligibility;

Have at least one secure drop box for every municipality (or at least one drop box for every 15,000 registered voters, for communities with a high concentration of registered voters);

Felony penalties associated with disclosing election results from an early voting site prior to Election Day also go into effect Tuesday.

Changes for abortion access and care

A slew of abortion-related laws take effect Tuesday, with among the biggest being a rollback of restrictions surrounding abortion providers – more commonly known as “TRAP laws.” This means providers will no longer have to deal with regulations surrounding hallway width, ceiling heights or HVAC systems.

The change comes as part of the Reproductive Health Act, signed into law Nov. 21, 2023, which also ushered in a handful of other changes, including:

Lifting the ban on dilation and extraction abortion procedures, the medical term for what is politically referred to as “partial-birth abortion;”

Doing away with requiring women to purchase a special rider if hoping to have their insurance cover abortion procedures;

Repealing a 1931 law that would have criminalized doctors and nurses who prescribed abortion medication to patients, and;

Allowing public universities to provide literature on abortion to pregnant students, should they want it.

Controversial energy citing package becomes official

Who gets to say where a large scale wind, solar or energy storage project goes in your city? As of Tuesday, that decision may come down to the state.

Signed in November, this new law effectively strips from local governments the permitting and zoning authority of utility-scale renewable projects. Instead, that authority would fall to the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC), which would then choose where these installations are constructed.

This change does allow an initial four- to eight-month period when developers could work with local officials before the state takes over. However, locals could not place any restrictions on projects stricter than state rules.

Whether this law is here to stay, though, remains to be seen. A petition effort to repeal the new act was given the green light in January by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers. To be successful, organizers will need to collect at least 356,958 signatures in the next 180 days if they hope to get it before voters on the November 2024 ballot.

‘Right-to-work’ is no more

Another March 2023 repeal, and Democrat-identified policy priority out the gate, was removing Michigan’s status as a so-called “right-to-work” state – and making the mitten the first state in nearly 60 years to do so.

The initial law prevented non-union workers from being forced to pay fees to any union they declined to join, as well as stops unions from making payments part of a job requirement in unionized workplaces. Pro-union advocates argued law was unfair, saying that non-union members received the benefits unions fought for without having to pay for them like other members did; anti-union organizations believe the repeal dissuades business from siting in Michigan, hindering the state’s ability to compete globally.

Even when enacted during the Snyder administration, “right-to-work” was a deeply controversial policy, with heated debate surrounding whether it produced an economic impact throughout its 10-year lifespan.

Financial disclosures now required for politicians, others

Unlike other bills on this list, this package of legislation was constitutionally required following the passage of Proposal 1 in 2022

Under these bills, public officials are required to do a number of things, including:

Requiring filers – including the governor, attorney general and secretary of state – to disclose the sources of any income or assets worth at least $1,000;

Require a lawmaker to disclose if their spouse does business with the state, or has a majority interest in a company that does business with the state;

Stop lawmakers from being seated, or otherwise do their elected job, if they’ve failed to file a financial disclosure. Upon filing, they could then take office.

Not all are happy with the change, however – though not because they don’t want to report. Rather, Democrats and Republicans alike have decried the bills as not being transparent enough, voting against the package in the legislature due to what they perceived as loopholes in the process.

Gender, sexual orientation protections codified

The spirit of these bills has been essentially in effect since the Michigan Supreme Court handed down a decision in 2020 which prohibits discrimination of a person’s gender or sexuality. However, that precedent was not written into law until Whitmer signed off on protections in mid-March of 2023.

Under the bills, Michigan’s anti-discrimination law will now explicitly protect Michiganders on the basis of sex and gender identity, after legislation amending the Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act. It ensures these protections will stay etched into state law, regardless if the Michigan Supreme Court case is upended by a new ruling.

Jeremy Moss, D-Southfield; Attorney General Dana Nessel, Rep. Jason Hoskins, D-Southfield, and advocate S'Niayh Tate.

Tackling Michigan’s third grade reading law

Michigan’s law requiring third-graders to repeat the school year if scoring too low on a state reading test is no more. Democrats gutted the policy – implemented in 2016 under the administration of then-Gov. Rick Snyder, though not in effect until 2020 – almost immediately upon taking office.

Whitmer then signed off on the move in March 2023. Parents can still choose to hold back their child over literacy concerns, but the state now can’t make that decision for them.

In the 2021-2022 school year, about 5,680 third-graders were eligible for being held back after scoring below Michigan’s English language arts standards. Of that number, districts only held back 545 students (just under 10%) for the 2022-23 school year, representing 0.6% of the state’s third grade enrollment per a Michigan State University Education Policy Innovation Collaborative report.

Changes to Michigan’s juvenile justice system ahead

Alongside the dozens of other changes set to take place Tuesday, Michigan’s juvenile justice system will also see a revamp due to a package of bills signed by Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist in December.

These changes would broaden the types of offenses eligible for diversion programs, in an effort to keep children out of jail. It also enables juvenile courts and law enforcement to use risk and mental health screening tools in determining where is best suited to handle their needs.

Other parts of the package include:"

Pennsylvania’s supreme court ruled on Monday that a lower court must hear a case challenging a ban on the use of government-funded healthcare to pay for abortions, raising hopes among reproductive rights advocates for an expansion of abortion access in the state and the establishment of a constitutional right to the procedure. The case, brought by abortion providers in the state, challenged a decades-old state law barring Medicaid from covering abortions, arguing that it should be overturned because it violates the broader rights guaranteed by the state constitution’s Equal Rights Amendment. Monday’s 3-2 ruling both overturns a lower court decision to dismiss the case and puts aside a 1985 state supreme court court decision that upheld the law banning the use of state Medicaid dollars for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.

More countries have halted funding to the largest UN agency operating in Gaza, as the crisis deepens over the alleged role of some staff in the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel. Japan and Austria said they were suspending payments to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. The US, UK, Germany and Italy are also among those who have suspended funding. UNRWA has told the BBC it is ""extremely desperate"" and that ""the humanitarian needs in Gaza are growing by the hour"". The agency has sacked several of its staff over allegations they were involved on 7 October, when Hamas gunmen infiltrated Israel, killing about 1,300 people - mainly civilians - and taking about 250 others back to Gaza as hostages.

US authorities have charged three men with plotting to murder an Iranian defector living in Maryland. Naji Sharifi Zindashti, 49, who lives in Iran, allegedly asked Canadian Damion Ryan to help with an assassination. Mr Ryan, a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club, then enlisted associate Adam Pearson, who is currently in prison. They are also accused of targeting the defector's female companion. Mr Zindashti - who US and UK officials say operates a criminal network targeting Iranian dissidents around the world on behalf of the Iranian government - agreed to pay Mr Ryan, 43, and Pearson, 29, a total of $350,000 (£275,000) plus $20,000 (£15,750) in travel expenses for the murder-for-hire, according to an indictment released Monday.

In the far, far suburbs of Houston, Texas, three teenagers are talking at a coffee shop about a clandestine bookshelf in their public school classroom. It's filled with books that have been challenged or banned. ""Some of the books that I've read are books like Hood Feminism, The Poet X, Gabi, A Girl in Pieces,"" says one of the girls. She's a 17-year-old senior with round glasses and long braids. The books, she says, sparked her feminist consciousness. ""I just see, especially in my community, a lot of women being talked down upon and those books [were] really nice to read.""

From the outside, the Hospital for the Negro Insane of Maryland, which opened in Crownsville, Md., in 1911, looked like a farm, with patients harvesting tobacco, constructing gardens and working with cattle. But Peabody award-winning NBC journalist Antonia Hylton says the hospital's interior told a different story. Inside, Crownsville Hospital, as it became known, had cold, concrete floors, small windows and seclusion cells in which patients were sometimes left for weeks at a time. And the facility was filthy, with a distinctive, unpleasant odor. ""There was a stench that emanated from most of the buildings so strong that generations of employees describe never being able to not smell that smell again, never being able to fully feel they washed it out of their clothes or their hair,"" Hylton says.

German doctors at 23 state-owned university hospitals are expected to walk out on Tuesday after hospital managers and union leaders failed to reach an agreement in collective bargaining talks. Several thousand doctors are expected to rally in the northern German city of Hanover to demand wage increases and restrictions on rotating shifts, which entail irregular working hours. The Marburger Bund trade union, which represents the doctors, is demanding a 12.5% pay increase as well as higher bonuses for regular night, weekend and on public holiday shifts for the more than 20,000 doctors at the university hospitals, which are financed by Germany's 16 federal states. Union leader Andreas Botzlar told the dpa news agency that the federal states ""do not want to face the fact that university hospitals are falling further and further behind – in terms of doctors' salaries as well as working conditions.""

French President Emmanuel Macron is set to push for changes to European Union (EU) legislation to address grievances being expressed by farmers in France and across the bloc, the country's farming minister Marc Fesneau said on Monday amid ongoing protests. Farmers set up chokepoints along major arteries into Paris on Monday afternoon, with the government ordering the deployment of 15,000 police and paramilitary gendarmes in response. The farmers attached signs to their tractors that read ""no food without farmers"" and ""the end of us would mean famine for you."" ""This is the final battle for farming. It's a question of survival,"" one farmer in the southwestern Lot-et-Garonne department told the AFP news agency.

Qatar’s prime minister has said “good progress” was made during a meeting between intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States over the weekend to discuss a possible deal to secure a truce in the Israel-Hamas war and the release of captives held by Palestinian groups in Gaza. Spy chiefs from the three countries, which have been leading negotiations on agreements to pause fighting since the start of the war on October 7, met over the weekend in the French capital Paris. The sides discussed a potential deal that would include a phased truce that would see women and children released first and humanitarian aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al Thani confirmed on Monday. “We are hoping to relay this proposal to Hamas and to get them to a place where they engage positively and constructively in the process,” the prime minister said during an event hosted by the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, the US.

The United States military announced on Sunday that three US soldiers were killed and at least 34 were wounded in a drone attack targeting Tower 22, a remote logistics outpost near the Jordan-Syrian border. The attack has elicited a strong reaction from Washington with President Joe Biden pledging to hold the attackers to account. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed armed groups in the region, claimed the attacks, saying it was in response to US support to Israel’s war on Gaza, which has killed more than 26,000 people. Here is what we know about the drone strike and the attack site:

Rishi Sunak’s troubled Rwanda deportation plan has been condemned by Conservative peers, historians and bishops in an indication that the House of Lords could demand changes that might delay its implementation. Ken Clarke, the Conservative former chancellor and former lord chancellor, joined the archbishop of Canterbury and the historian Peter Hennessy on Monday evening in opposing the government’s plan to overturn a ruling by the UK’s highest court and send asylum seekers to the central African country. They were among more than 60 members of the Lords listed to speak during the second reading debate of the government’s safety of Rwanda (asylum and immigration) bill The draft legislation seeks to block the supreme court’s findings of fact that Rwanda was not a safe destination for asylum seekers because they would be at risk of refoulement.

Ukrainians who have moved to the UK have highlighted the lack of dentists as among the most astonishing aspects of British life, according to a report on the experiences of people granted humanitarian visas. Access to medical care is free of charge on the NHS for Ukrainians, but researchers at Birmingham University heard notably outspoken accounts about the difficulty of securing dental treatment. The provision of dentistry services under the NHS was even negatively compared with that in Ukraine, which was a popular destination for dental care tourists before the war thanks to low charges and good availability. One woman in her 30s, Boyka, told the researchers: “We don’t have a dentist. It’s crazy. For us, it’s, like, impossible! In Ukraine the dentist industry is huge, you know, everywhere, and because it’s everywhere you just go and it’s like £10, £8, and you can clean it, whiten it like [a] Hollywood smile!

Officials in Brussels have reportedly drawn up a secret plan to sabotage Hungary’s economy if Viktor Orbán decides this week to again block a €50bn support package for Ukraine. The plan, reported by the Financial Times, reflects the fury mounting across European capitals at what one diplomat called the “policy of blackmail” being pursued by the Hungarian prime minister, who leads the bloc’s most pro-Russia state. The FT said the strategy involved targeting Hungary’s economy, weakening its currency and reducing investor confidence.

Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. government in recent months launched an operation to fight a pervasive Chinese hacking operation that successfully compromised thousands of internet-connected devices, according to two Western security officials and one person familiar with the matter. The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation sought and received legal authorization to remotely disable aspects of the Chinese hacking campaign, the sources told Reuters. The Biden administration has increasingly focused on hacking, not only for fear nation states may try to disrupt the U.S. election in November, but because ransomware wreaked havoc on Corporate America in 2023. The hacking group at the center of recent activity, Volt Typhoon , has especially alarmed intelligence officials who say it is part of a larger effort to compromise Western critical infrastructure, including naval ports, internet service providers and utilities.

WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday vowed the U.S. would take ""all necessary actions"" to defend its troops after a deadly drone attack in Jordan by Iran-backed militants, even as President Joe Biden's administration stressed it was not seeking a war with Iran. ""Let me start with my outrage and sorrow (for) the deaths of three brave U.S. troops in Jordan and for the other troops who were wounded,"" Austin said at the Pentagon. ""The president and I will not tolerate attacks on U.S. forces and we will take all necessary actions to defend the U.S. and our troops,"" Austin added at the start of meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at the Pentagon. The attack on Sunday killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded more than 40 troops. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. troops since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October and marks a major escalation in tensions that have engulfed the Middle East.

Kaitlin Armstrong was successfully hiding in Costa Rica for weeks when she responded to an ad for a yoga teacher – a mistake authorities say led to her arrest and eventual conviction for the murder of professional cyclist Anna Moriah ""Mo"" Wilson. Armstrong, 36, was convicted and sentenced to 90 years in prison in 2023 after the fatal shooting of 25-year-old Wilson over a love triangle involving Armstrong's boyfriend, Colin Strickland, another pro cyclist. Wilson's body was discovered on May 11, 2022. Shortly after the killing, Armstrong used a fake passport to flee to Costa Rica where she was believed to be hiding in one of the country's many hostels, detectives with the U.S. Marshals Service told CBS’ “48 Hours” in a first-time interview over the weekend."
Jan 24 2024,Attorney General certifies ballot title for abortion amendment,KTLO,center,https://ktlo.com/2024/01/24/attorney-general-certifies-ballot-title-for-abortion-amendment,"Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin has certified the popular name and ballot title for an abortion amendment that could appear on the 2024 ballot.

Currently, Arkansas law bans abortions except in cases of a medical emergency to save the life of a mother. If voters support the amendment, access to abortion will become part of the Arkansas Constitution. The measure would forbid any laws from being passed to restrict abortion in cases of rape, incest, or fatal fetal anomaly or to protect the life or well-being of the mother within the first 18 weeks after conception.

Supporters of the Arkansas Abortion Amendment may now begin collecting the signatures required as the next step in the ballot inclusion process. The signatures must be collected by July 5th and turned into the Attorney General’s office for certification.

Jan 17 2024,Attorney general blocks constitutional abortion proposal,Montana Free Press,left,https://montanafreepress.org/2024/01/17/montana-attorney-general-blocks-constitutional-abortion-proposal,"Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has blocked a ballot proposal seeking to create a constitutional right to abortion, labeling the initiative “legally insufficient” after a required review by his office.

In a memorandum dated Jan. 16, Knudsen said the proposed ballot initiative spearheaded by Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana, Ballot Measure #14, improperly “logrolls multiple distinct political choices into a single initiative” and limits the state’s ability to protect public health and safety.

“Ballot Measure 14 creates an express right to abortion but denies voters the ability to express their views on the nuance of the right. This is classic logrolling and is prohibited by Article XIV, Section 11” of the Montana Constitution, Knudsen wrote.

The backers of the initiative, organized through the committee Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, said they intend to challenge Knudsen’s decision in state court within 10 days, the time designated by the ballot proposal process. If the Montana Supreme Court rules in its favor, the coalition could soon begin collecting signatures to shepherd the initiative to the 2024 ballot.

In a statement Wednesday, an attorney for the ballot issue committee said Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights was disappointed by Knudsen’s decision and accused the attorney general of wrongly interfering in the ballot proposal process.

“In an attempt to keep an abortion rights initiative out of the hands of voters, Attorney General Austin Knudsen has used the power of his office to put personal politics before a fair process to allow Montanans the opportunity to secure their reproductive rights,” attorney Raph Graybill said in a statement provided to Montana Free Press Wednesday evening, adding that the committee was “confident” in the ballot language submitted in November. “Make no mistake: We will do everything we can, including taking legal action, to ensure Montanans have the opportunity to vote to secure their rights to make decisions about their own pregnancies, including the right to abortion care, in 2024.”

Spokespersons for the attorney general’s office did not respond to emailed questions Wednesday.

If advocates are successful in court and clear the other hurdles leading up to November, voters will get to weigh in on the constitutional initiative that, in the language drafted, “affirms the right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion, in the Montana Constitution.”

The proposal continues to state that, if approved, the amendment “prohibits the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability. Additionally, the amendment ensures that the government cannot deny or burden access to an abortion when it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health. This constitutional amendment prevents the government from punishing patients, health care providers, or anyone who assists someone in seeking reproductive care, including abortion care.”

In his legal review, Knudsen said the proposed ballot language would preclude elected officials from enacting reasonable regulations and restrictions on abortion when the practice is determined “medically necessary.”

“This clause makes it so even regulations that serve a compelling state interest and are narrowly tailored to that interest cannot survive,” Knudsen wrote.

Knudsen also said that, as written, the constitutional amendment would preclude Montanans from passing future regulations on abortion that reflect their nuanced and complicated views on the issue, particularly in relation to fetal viability and various health risks to the pregnant patient.

“First, voters’ views on abortion change dramatically based on the specific timeframe of pregnancy in which the abortion occurs. Second, states commonly treat physical and psychological conditions differently. States also commonly use qualifying language to clarify when an abortion is medically necessary,” Knudsen wrote. “Ballot Measure 14 creates an express right to abortion but denies voters the ability to express their views on the nuance of the right.”

Knudsen’s office previously blocked a different ballot initiative related to the creation of a top-four primary system in Montana, citing similar concerns about “logrolling” multiple subjects into one proposal. The coalition behind that ballot initiative filed a legal challenge over Knudsen’s decision and was affirmed by the Montana Supreme Court within weeks, clearing the way for signature collection.

As of Wednesday, six proposed ballot initiatives have been allowed to begin collecting signatures, according to the Montana secretary of state’s website. None have yet met the threshold for inclusion in November’s election."

Jan 22 2024,Activists Begin Effort to Enshrine Abortion in Colorado Constitution,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2024/01/22/left-wing-activists-begin-effort-to-enshrine-abortion-in-colorado-constitution,"Left-wing activists have officially begun their effort to establish the “right” to kill the unborn in Colorado — a state that already has no limits on abortion.

Besides enshrining the “right” to abortion in the state constitution, the measure would undo a 1984 voter-passed amendment that prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. That amendment essentially outlawed health insurance coverage for abortions for public employees and those using Medicaid.

The coalition behind the abortion amendment is called Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom, and it is comprised of left-wing organizations — including Cobalt, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Colorado. The group announced the beginning of its signature-collection efforts on the fifty-first anniversary of the Supreme Court’s now-defunct 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which had invented a constitutional “right” to abortion.

“We’ve always been a national leader on this issue. We’ve always been a place where people who needed abortion care were able to come,” Laura Chapin, a spokesperson for the coalition, told NBC News:

This ballot measure is very much of, about and for Coloradans, but I also think Colorado is a place where people look to as a hopeful symbol right now. We’re a place where people look at us and say, “Colorado is a place where they look out for people and they protect people.” So I think for us this ballot measure is both practical and symbolic.

The coalition must collect a little more than 124,000 valid signatures from two percent of the total registered voters in each of the state’s 35 Senate districts by April 26 to make it on the November ballot. If the measure makes it on the ballot, it would need the support of 55 percent of voters to pass.

Activists in several other states are working to put abortion amendments on the ballot in 2024 after a string of state-level pro-abortion victories following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022.

On Tuesday, six different pro-lifers were found guilty by the Department of Justice (DOJ) after they took part in a peaceful protest at an abortion facility in Tennessee a few years ago. The protestors were singing hymns and praying outside of the facility and now face up to 11-years-of prison each, according to The Daily Wire.

On March 5, 2021, a group of demonstrators gathered in a hallway outside of the Mount Juliet abortion clinic. While there, the group sang songs like “Holy, Holy, Holy,” “It is Well with My Soul,” and “Amazing Grace,” and read Bible verses, one of which from Psalm 91 about being covered in the Lord’s protection. The group also enlightened women seeking abortions that there were other options than to kill their child in utero.

The Department of Justice has accused pro-life activists of violating the FACE Act and engaging in a civil rights… pic.twitter.com/YcXC2ByMop — I Meme Therefore I Am 🇺🇸 (@ImMeme0) January 30, 2024

In October of 2022, 11 activists who were involved were charged with blocking the abortion center. And, on Tuesday, six of them were found guilty for “conspiracy against rights” and violating Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE).

Steve Crampton from the Thomas Moore Society Senior Counsel that’s representing Paul Vaughin, one of the six protestors, insisted that they would appeal the verdict.

This was a peaceful demonstration by entirely peaceable citizens—filled with prayer, hymn-singing, and worship—oriented toward persuading expecting mothers not to abort their babies. Unfortunately, the Biden Department of Justice decided to characterize Paul Vaughn’s peaceful actions as a felony ‘conspiracy against rights,’ to intimidate and punish Paul and other pro-life people and people of faith.

The six individuals are set to be sentenced on July 2, according to The Daily Wire.

In response to the news, users on X were stunned.

“Biden administration shows they hate nobody more than those who would protect life as 6 pro-lifers are convicted and face 11 years in prison for trying to stop women from slaughtering their babies,” one user wrote.

“The US is now a police state,” another indicated.

One more pointed out how hypocritical the justice system is and wrote how crazy it was that these protestors were found guilty.

“But in Obama’s America Antifa/BLM rioters can burn down a federal police building & no charges whatsoever,” the user wrote.

This verdict came the same week that another religious protestor was charged with a “hate crime” after he took down a Satanic statue.

It’s incredibly obvious that our government is targeting Christians and pro-religious or pro-life values and attempting to make those groups out as the villains."

There was a major milestone Friday for efforts to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.The groups behind it now have enough valid signatures on the petition required to put the measure on the ballot for voters this November.Since last April, the political committee Floridians Protecting Freedom representing Planned Parenthood, other abortion rights groups and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has been collecting signatures to place a proposed amendment on the ballot in November to ""limit government interference with abortion.""Related: Abortion clinics, ACLU sue Florida over upcoming abortion lawsThe group now has the required number of valid voter signatures — more than 911,000 as of mid-afternoon — although the political committee has collected roughly 1.5 million signatures from voters like Jazmine Card, who says protecting a woman's right to choose is vital. “As a woman, to have somebody else tell me what to do with my body, I feel like, it isn't right for anybody,"" Card said. During a news conference, Lauren Brenzel, campaign director of Floridians Protecting Freedom, said, “We believe that politicians interfering with women's private medical decisions, is dangerous, around abortion, are dangerous. And we cannot let politicians have the ultimate say on this issue.” Related: Florida attorney general argues against proposed abortion rights amendment But Rep. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody is fighting to keep the abortion measure off the ballot, arguing that allowing abortion until ""viability"" as it states in the proposed ballot language, is too vague.The medical community generally agrees that viability of a fetus occurs at approximately 24 weeks gestation. Others critical of the proposed measure question why much of the nearly $10 million raised to fund the petition drive, which is revealed in campaign finance records, is coming from outside Florida.One of them is Republican Palm Bay State Rep. Randy Fine, who told WESH 2 News, “Look, when out-of-state money comes in, they have proven they have the ability to send paid signature gatherers out to get signatures, and this is not the first time they have done so.” Fine says voters should reject the initiative.“I think this is basically written to allow abortion anytime on demand for any reason, and I think that the ballot language isn't clear,"" Fine said. It's clear enough, argues Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried, for so many voters to sign the petition to show their support.“This is greater than reproductive health care. This is about our freedoms to make sure that we are living in a society that is fair and just and keeping government out of our bedrooms,"" Fried said.

If the court of mostly conservative justices favors the state, 30 days after the ruling, a more-restrictive six-week abortion ban passed in 2023 will take effect with exceptions for rape and incest, but only if a woman provides proof of a crime or alleged crime and only up to 15 weeks. If the proposed abortion rights amendment makes it to the ballot, 60% of voters would have to approve it for the measure to be written into the state constitution.

The case stems from the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, which prohibits Medicaid from covering abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or it puts the patient’s life at risk. A state Supreme Court ruling three years later established that the law is not a form of sex discrimination, meaning it cannot be challenged under the Pennsylvania Equal Rights Amendment."

Jan 03 2024,Wisconsin: The Abortion Factor and Victory in 2024,Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2024/1/3/2215123/-Wisconsin-The-Abortion-Factor-and-Victory-in-2024,"Wisconsin volunteers had a very full year last year. Most of the people who canvassed with Hope Springs last year had spent the early Spring knocking on doors for the Wisconsin Dems before the April elections (successfully electing Janet Protasiewicz to the state Supreme Court) before knocking on 372,988 doors with Hope Springs in the late Spring, Summer and early Fall. We have now knocked on 38.4% of all doors in Wisconsin.

The Wisconsin volunteers i talked to in December were very confident about the re-election of Tammy Baldwin. i agree, for perhaps different reasons. Baldwin has always put together a strong organization, she reaches out to all parts of Wisconsin and shows up in places where traditional Democrats have stopped going. One of our Wisconsin organizers (who i caught up with at the Obama alumni reunion in November) sends me a text every time someone announces they won’t run against Baldwin (“another one bites the dust”). So far, no high-profile Republican has announced they are running.

But that won’t change Baldwin’s campaign strategy. As she has said, she won’t “write off anybody. Don’t write off any area. You really do have to show up to listen, but also follow up and be a champion for the pocketbook-issues that everybody struggles with.” Our Wisconsin volunteers expect her organization and efforts to help not just Biden but a slew of Democrats, especially those expected to run for state legislature under new district lines.

And Baldwin definitely has run some of the best senate campaigns waged in more Rural states. Everyone expects her to do so again this year.

But she is also a beneficiary of one of the best state Democratic organizations in the country. WisDems has really rebuilt since the Walker recall election (perhaps renewal is a better term here than rebuilt) and serves as a model for Swing State Democratic party orgs. After Hope Springs stopped canvassing this September, WisDems held a statewide canvass after the November election, focused on local priorities and targets. That’s no mean feat.

Times/Siena Poll

“Heading into 2024, the Dairy State remains somewhat unpredictable” in the presidential race. In 2020, Biden defeated Trump by 20,682 votes in Wisconsin, a margin of ~0.7%. “Biden visited Wisconsin multiple times in 2023 and that will continue in 2024, while Trump barnstormed the state in his two prior races, and the same should be expected through the fall.” The “Marquette poll finds Biden has slight edge over Trump,” and the Times/Siena Poll agreed. Other polls of Likely Voters in Wisconsin are equally encouraging. But Wisconsin was also a state where voters have told us that they don’t hear (or know) much about Biden’s accomplishments — and they want to hear more.

One of the things that seemed to excite the volunteers i had met with in December was that they had registered 680 New Voters since we started knocking on doors there. In total, our efforts there have resulted in 3,127 voters correctly registered at their current address. It’s the little things, but essential in our super-compliance strategy of protecting the vote.

Everywhere i went, volunteers (and organizers) wanted to talk about the Ohio elections. Even though Wisconsin won’t replicate the Kansas and Ohio referendums, Reproductive Freedom is still an issue in the state:

Planned Parenthood resumed abortion services at three locations in 2023, the lawsuit over Wisconsin's abortion laws isn't over quite yet. Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanski is appealing a Dane County judge's ruling that the state's 1849 law applies to feticide, not abortions. The case could ultimately reach the state Supreme Court.

“We can never relax in Wisconsin,” one volunteer (in the WOW counties!) noted. That seems about right.

While i don’t agree with the initial premise here:

the playbook for Democrats has largely relied on the issue of abortion rights. The strategy has mostly been successful among Wisconsinites who reelected Gov. Tony Evers last year and supported Justice Janet Protasiewicz by double digits to flip the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court this past spring. Though the issue remains tied up in the legal system in Wisconsin, Chergosky believes talk of a national abortion ban will likely reignite the topic on the campaign trail. “Abortion motivates the base of the party, and having a motivated base is extremely important in the broader context of the general election come November 2024. I also think abortion has the potential to swing some of those undecided voters, so this goes back to the role that abortion played in the 2022 Midterm elections.”

The advantage that Democrats have, in Wisconsin and elsewhere, is that the issue of abortion is a consequential contrast to Trump and the MAGA Republicans. It makes women more determined to vote, and, even if they have Republican leanings, to take Democratic candidates more seriously. The voters we have been talking to, Democrats and independents, don’t want to be around crazy, and Trump and his minions are the craziest out there. The more that Democrats talk about individual freedoms and Constitutional Rights, the more likely we will win in 2024.

But the volunteers and organizers i talked to in Wisconsin were hopeful of the opportunities presented by 2023 and wanted to know how we could take advantage of those opportunities:

One of the first, sweeping changes that will come to Wisconsin in spring is new legislative maps, which will have to be in place by March 15, according to the Wisconsin Elections Commission. The new maps could alter the makeup of the Legislature, possibly giving Democrats more power. It might also change who your representative or senator is: Half of the state Senate and the full state Assembly will run in new districts. And keep an eye out for possible appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, after Assembly Speaker Robin Vos indicated Republicans would take the ruling to the nation's highest court.

We won’t know the answer until we see the maps (or whether Republicans can get a stay from the Supreme Court) but “New maps are likely to remove some of the Republican advantage conferred by gerrymandering, with the state Supreme Court’s ruling stating that partisan fairness will be a factor when it comes to redrawing districts. Democrats could be fielding candidates in places across the state that haven’t seen a competitive race in nearly two decades.”

Our work in Wisconsin, then, just continues to expand. One of the things that the Baldwin campaign requested was to be the “lead” on Constituent Service Requests we collect this year. We’ve collected more than 4,000 CSRs in the state and voters there have had much higher participation in making requests than almost any other state. Wisconsinites want their government to work for them, and this is just another datapoint where we can heighten awareness that Democrats Deliver!

But we need your help. Like everyone else, we are asking for financial support for these vital efforts. If you are like me, you are inundated with requests. We don’t have any cute pets, or special treats, to offer up to encourage your support. Nor will we try to guilt you by telling you the threat is real, ongoing and getting more sophisticated. We are all getting tired of the incessant fund-raising.

But if you are able to contribute to our efforts to protect Democratic voters, especially in minority communities, expand the electorate, and believe in grassroots efforts to increase voter participation and election protection, please do. We need your help:

Feb 02 2024,How pending Supreme Court case could restrict Montana abortion access,Missoulian,center,https://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/rural-health-care-montana-abortion-mifepristone-supreme-court/article_b9e49a51-2a60-5df7-884b-e2a7626eb77d.html,"The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case in March that could ban access to abortion medication obtained by telemedicine and mail, which accounted for almost 19% of abortions in Montana in 2023.

The case would also shorten the timeframe for in-person medication abortions from 10 weeks to seven weeks. In-person medication abortion accounted for 60% of abortions in Montana in 2023, according to data provided by the state's three providers.

When Montana’s legislature passed a bill in 2021 that would have banned the use of telemedicine and mail for abortions, Planned Parenthood sued the state. The Montana Supreme Court temporarily blocked the law on the grounds that it violated the state constitution.

Three years later, the case is still pending, and the temporary block is still in effect.

“Montana’s Constitution affords significantly broader protection than the federal constitution” when it comes to matters of privacy, such as medical decisions, Montana Supreme Court Justice Laurie McKinnon wrote in a 2023 opinion on a case in which the court unanimously ruled in favor of allowing advanced practice registered nurses to provide abortions.

Nevertheless, the case before the U.S. Supreme Court highlights the power of the federal government to place its own restrictions on abortion — a reminder that comes in an election year with a competitive senate race.

The drug in question, mifepristone, was approved by the Federal Drug Administration for abortions in the first seven weeks of pregnancy in 2000. In 2016, the FDA updated guidelines for use up to 10 weeks. In 2021, it was approved for use with consultation via telemedicine, rather than requiring patients to attend in-person appointments.

The federal case, filed by the anti-abortion group Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, seeks to revert the FDA guidelines to the pre-2016 rules, meaning that mifepristone could only be administered up to seven weeks into pregnancy. Patients would also be required to attend three in-person doctor’s visits to obtain the medication.

As of 2021, 56% of abortions nationwide were medication abortions, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In Montana, that figure — which includes medication obtained in-person and via mail — was 79%.

In that same year, 48% of abortions in Montana occurred within the first six weeks of pregnancy. Another 36% occurred between seven and nine weeks.

440 miles roundtrip

Of the Montana women who received abortions by mail through Planned Parenthood between July 2020 and June 2021, 56% would have had to drive at least one to two hours each way to attend an appointment and 18% would have had to drive two to five hours each way, according to legal documents filed as part of group’s 2021 case against the state.

Patients travel an average of 440 miles roundtrip to visit an abortion provider in Montana, according to the Montana Abortion Access Program (MAAP).

If the old guidelines were to be reinstated, Montanans would have to go to All Families Healthcare in Whitefish, Blue Mountain Clinic in Missoula, or Planned Parenthood in Helena to receive an abortion after seven weeks. Planned Parenthood Helena only offers procedural abortions two to three days of the month.

The Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine argues that mifepristone poses risks and requires greater oversight by medical professionals. They believe that the FDA did not adequately evaluate the risks that could result from changing the timeline and the in-person requirement prior to changing the guidelines.

Viagra more dangerous

Opponents argue that the ""overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and two decades of medical practice show that mifepristone is safe and effective and that it is not medically necessary to impose additional restrictions,” according to a legal brief by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

“Using Viagra is more dangerous than using mifepristone,"" the brief said.

Just one day after the Supreme Court announced the March 26 date for oral arguments on the case, the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America foundation endorsed U.S. Senate hopeful Tim Sheehy.

That same day, Sen. Jon Tester signed a document to the Supreme Court in support of the FDA. Tester spoke out in favor of abortion medication earlier last year, when Walgreens and CVS limited access to the medication in Montana pharmacies.

“I’ll continue to fight back against any effort from Washington politicians that would limit health care options for women in rural America and strip away Montanans’ freedoms,” Tester said in a statement on the pending case.

The Sheehy campaign could not be reached for comment.

Senate Republicans “do not support a federal ban on all abortions” Sen. Steve Daines said in a statement in response to questions about his position on this case.

""There should be reasonable limits placed on painful late-term abortions, with exception for rape, incest, and the life of the mother,” the statement continued.

When asked what this means for his position on this case, which is about first trimester abortions, a spokesperson for Daines said that he ""will continue to fight against the radical Democrat efforts to allow abortion-on-demand up until birth.""

Currently, Montana is considered “protective” of abortion access, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Montana has increasingly become a destination for people seeking abortions in neighboring states, as there are no abortion providers in Idaho, North Dakota, or South Dakota, according to MAAP. There is one clinic in Wyoming, in Casper, which recently reopened after being closed due to arson.

In 2021, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 14% of abortions in Montana were for out-of-state patients, according to the CDC.

Several state laws passed in the last couple of years — which have been blocked from going into effect pending litigation — would drastically change abortion access in the state.

In the same lawsuit challenging the state’s telemedicine and mail abortion ban, Planned Parenthood is also challenging two other laws passed in 2021: one bans abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and another requires pregnant women be offered an ultrasound prior to receiving an abortion. Neither are in effect due to the supreme court’s temporary block.

Other abortion bills

Six other abortion bills were passed in the 2023 legislative session, including a law banning the most common surgical abortion procedure and another disallowing Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of incest, rape, or to save the life of the mother.

Planned Parenthood and other providers sued the state in response to these two laws and a Lewis and Clark County District Court judge granted temporary blocks on them.

It could be years before these cases are resolved. A 2018 lawsuit, filed by Helen Weems of All Families Healthcare, challenged a state law prohibiting advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) from providing abortions. In May 2023, the Montana Supreme Court unanimously upheld a Lewis and Clark County District Court ruling in favor of Weems, which allows APRNs to provide abortions.

The court found that the state failed to demonstrate that abortions performed by APRNs pose a safety risk that would warrant state intervention.

And if there weren’t enough lawsuits already, just three days before the scheduling for the federal case was announced, a group called Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights filed a case in the state supreme court against Attorney General Austin Knudsen, for blocking the group’s ballot proposal for Montanans to vote in November on whether to explicitly protect pre-viability abortion in the state constitution."

Feb 02 2024,Wyoming Supreme Court Says Pro-Lifers Can't Intervene In Abortion Lawsuit,Cowboy State Daily,right,https://cowboystatedaily.com/2024/02/02/wyoming-supreme-court-says-pro-lifers-cant-intervene-in-abortion-lawsuit,"The Wyoming Supreme Court on Friday denied a petition by two state lawmakers and a pro-life group to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the state’s two abortion bans.

Pro-life group Right To Life Wyoming and Republican state Reps. Chip Neiman and Rachel Rodriguez-Williams do not have significant, protectable legal interests in the lawsuit’s issues to justify their joining the case, and the state Attorney General’s office is already representing the pro-life argument, says the high court’s order penned by Chief Justice Kate Fox.

Fox’s opinion upholds an earlier ruling by Teton County District Court Judge Melissa Owens, who also denied the group and the legislators a chance to intervene in Johnson v. Wyoming.

Filed in March 2023, the lawsuit is a pro-choice coalition’s attempt to overturn Wyoming’s abortion bans. Owens also blocked both bans from being enforced while the case is ongoing. One of the bans outlaws nearly all abortions, with exemptions for pregnancies conceived through rape and incest; and the other bans the marketing and transfer of chemicals to cause abortions.

If allowed to go into effect, the bans could punish doctors for causing abortions, but not the pregnant women undergoing them.

""While we are disappointed in the court's decision, we are proud to continue our pro-life work in the Legislature and in our everyday lives,"" Rodriguez-Williams and Neiman told Cowboy State Daily via a joint statement Friday. ""I pray that the courts will uphold Wyoming's pro-life law, which will save lives and protect women's health. No one can deny that life is a human right.""

No Right To Intervene

The first intervention mechanism the Wyoming Supreme Court studied is intervention of right: the idea that parties can join a lawsuit if they have protectible interests in its outcome, if the outcome could impair their exercise of that interest, if no one in the lawsuit is adequately protecting those interests, and if their application to intervene is timely.

Right To Life Wyoming (RTLW) and the lawmakers did apply for intervention in a timely manner, but they didn’t satisfy the other legal criteria to join the suit, Owens had ruled.

The high court agrees.

Advocacy Not Enough

Fox’s opinion breaks down some of the cases the pro-lifers cited as evidence that their advocacy, time and investment in the pro-life cause formulate a protectible interest in the case’s outcome.

For example, the 10th Circuit case Coalition of Arizona v. Department of the Interior focused on whether the Mexican Spotted Owl should be protected under the Endangered Species Act.

Dr. Robin Silver, a wildlife photographer, amateur biologist and naturalist asked to intervene in that lawsuit to protect his interest in the owl. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decided Silver should be able to intervene, because the Endangered Species Act conveyed a legal right, essentially, for Silver to enjoy the owl.

Right to Life Wyoming did not point to a law conferring a similar right with respect to the abortion issue, says the opinion.

Also, the opinion adds, RTLW won’t be regulated by the abortion bans.

“Once the abortion laws challenged in this case were enacted, the responsibility for enforcing and defending the laws shifted to the government,” says the opinion. “At that point, RTLW’s advocacy for the laws and its interest in the policy underlying them became no different from or greater than that of the public at large.”

This Branch Makes Laws

The high court made the same conclusion regarding Neiman and Rodriguez-Williams’ bid to intervene.

It also rebutted the lawmakers’ argument that one of their interests in the case is protecting the Legislature’s authority to enact laws governing abortion and to protect the health and general welfare of the people.

The Legislature can still regulate health care and abortion, but will have to stay within the confines of the Wyoming Constitution as interpreted by the judicial branch, says the opinion.

It’s a statement loaded with portent and potential for both sides of this dispute: Owens is still contemplating whether the Wyoming Constitution’s promise of health-care autonomy confers a right to abortion.

She also may have to decide whether a limit on that promise — that the Legislature can regulate health-care autonomy to preserve the general welfare of Wyoming — preserves lawmakers’ ability to ban abortion.

The Wyoming Supreme Court did not make that decision for her.

“Interpreting the constitution is exclusively the province of the courts and does not impinge on the Legislature’s authority to vote on legislation,” the opinion says.

Lastly, the high court rejected the lawmakers’ petition because the abortion bans don’t specify that they can intervene in the legal challenges the bans spark.

An earlier draft of the criminal abortion ban did contain an intervention mechanism, but that language didn’t survive the legislative process.

Court Says Too Messy

Even when parties don’t have a right to intervene under the set legal criteria, they can ask for permissive intervention, a more discretionary entrance to a case allowed if their interests align with the case issues and their intervention won’t bog down the case with delays and repeat arguments.

Owens had denied permissive intervention too, saying letting the petitioners into the case would politicize and complicate it — and the Wyoming Attorney General’s office already represents their interests adequately.

The Wyoming Supreme Court upheld Owens’ decision.

Evidence Arena

RTLW and the lawmakers disputed the way the Attorney General’s office, via deputy attorney Jay Jerde, is defending the state’s abortion bans.

Jerde has argued that whether abortion is health care, and whether abortion is constitutional, are legal issues Owens should consider to produce a ruling.

The proposed intervenors and the pro-choice plaintiffs both have disagreed, saying they’d like to show evidence demonstrating the validity of their arguments in a hearing or trial.

That puts the proposed intervenors at odds with the AG’s office on legal strategies, but it doesn’t mean the AG’s office is doing a poor job defending the bans, the high court ruled.

The opinion notes that the AG’s office filed a nearly 100-page opposition to the plaintiffs’ request that the laws be blocked immediately as they went into effect.

The state and the proposed intervenors “share this same goal, (and) we presume the State Defendants’ representation is adequate,” the order adds.

Would Be A Rumble

The state Supreme Court also agreed with Owens that letting the intervenors into the case would bog it down.

“Intervention would risk duplicative and cumulative argument, which would delay the matter to the detriment of the parties,” the order says.

Before Owens’ court, Secretary of State Chuck Gray also had asked to intervene in the case, and Owens denied his petition along with the others.

But when Rodriguez-Williams, Neiman and Right To Life Wyoming appealed to the state Supreme Court, Gray decided it was best not to join the appeal.

Jan 23 2024,"Biden features Texans in abortion rights rally, campaign video",KXAN News,not-yet-rated,https://kxan.com/news/political-news/biden-features-texans-in-abortion-rights-rally-campaign-video,"MANASSAS, Virginia (Nexstar) — Abortion rights were the key focus of President Joe Biden’s first campaign of the year, as Democrats bet on it as their most formidable issue heading into the 2024 election.

At a Tuesday rally in Virginia, Texas resident Amanda Zurawski — the leading plaintiff in a lawsuit against the state over its abortion laws — introduced Biden on stage after telling the crowd about how she nearly died after she was denied an abortion in Texas.

Zurawski said she and her husband desperately wanted a child, but at about 18 weeks she started experiencing “catastrophic complications,” before her membranes ruptured and she later became septic.

“We were devastated. What I needed at that point was an abortion so I could safely and with dignity deliver my daughter,” she said. “I needed to begin the healing process, both physically and emotionally. But unfortunately, this was post Roe in Texas. The near-total abortion ban had gone into effect.”

During the rally — which coincides with the New Hampshire primaries — Biden targeted his likely opponent, former President Donald Trump, telling the crowd that it is Trump who is responsible for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and therefore restrictive laws in states like Texas.

“Donald Trump is betting you won’t vote on this issue,” Biden said. “He’s betting that you’re going to stop caring, by the way, that you’ll get distracted, discouraged, stay home. Well guess what? I’m betting he’s wrong.”

The rally comes as most polls show a close race in a hypothetical rematch with Trump.

Trump has bragged about the influence he had in appointing more conservative justices on the U.S. Supreme Court — who would go on to overturn abortion protections in summer 2022. At a Fox News town hall in Iowa, he declared: “I did it. I’m proud to have done it.

On Monday, Biden’s campaign released a video ad featuring another Texas woman part of the Zurawski lawsuit — Dr. Austin Dennard. The Dallas OB-GYN and mother joined the lawsuit after finding herself in a similar situation as Zurawski, after she experienced severe complications with her pregnancy, and ultimately left the state to get an abortion for a child she had wanted.

“In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,” Dennard said in the campaign ad. “We need leaders that will protect our rights and not take them away. And that’s Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”

Republicans grapple with messaging on abortion

Texas law prohibits all abortions except under limited circumstances, such as a “life-threatening condition to the mother caused by the pregnancy.” Physicians who perform an abortion outside of these circumstances could be subject to a sentence of up to life in prison and at least a $100,000 fine for each offense. Authors of the legislation said the state’s trigger law works in concert with Texas’ 2021 law, known as Senate Bill 8 — which allows private citizens to sue providers or anyone who aids and abets abortions that occur after six weeks.

In Texas, Republicans have been hesitant to weigh in on whether exceptions to Texas’ abortion laws should be expanded.

Responding to reporter questions at an unrelated event in December, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn did not directly say if he thinks the Texas law should be modified to clarify exceptions in the cases of women like Zurawski and Dennard.

“We’re in a period of transition, where previously because of Roe versus Wade, this is all decided, one size fits all at the national level. And now it’s transitioning back to the states,” he said. “And I think there’s an important conversation going on between the voters in the various states and they have their elected representatives about where, where the lines should be drawn.”

Caroline Vakil, a campaign reporter with The Hill, points to Democrats’ successes in other states where abortion has literally been on the ballot in recent elections.

“I think that Republicans sort of underestimated how galvanizing of an issue it was going to be,” she said. “I think both parties are trying to paint the other as extreme. But I think in this case, we’re starting to see which side resonates a little bit more with voters.”

Recent polls in Texas show abortion is a top ranking issue for voter, but does not rank nearly as high as issues like the economy and immigration/border security."
Jan 22 2024,"Biden, Harris team up to campaign for abortion rights in Virginia",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-abortion-virginia-2024-rally-32acf43a2f89ff539d9864617e9857cc,"MANASSAS, Va. (AP) — President Joe Biden on Tuesday condemned abortion bans that have increasingly endangered the health of pregnant women, forcing them to grow sicker before they can receive medical care, and he laid the blame on Donald Trump, his likely Republican challenger in this year’s election.

“He’s betting we won’t hold him responsible,” Biden said to a crowd of hundreds of cheering supporters. “He’s betting you’re going to stop caring.”

“But guess what?” he added. “I’m betting he’s wrong. I’m betting you won’t forget.”

The rally with Vice President Kamala Harris came on the same day as the Republican primary in New Hampshire, where Trump tightened his grip on his party’s presidential nomination. Biden won the largely symbolic Democratic primary via a write-in campaign after he refused to appear on the ballot.

The Virginia rally demonstrated how Democrats hope to harness enduring anger over abortion restrictions to blunt his comeback bid.

Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court less than two years ago in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a decision enabled by three conservative justices appointed by Trump.

“The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden said.

The speech was Biden’s bluntest yet on abortion and the status of reproductive health, but it was disrupted several times by protests over Israel’s war in Gaza. One person shouted “shame on you!”

“This is going to go on for a while; they got this planned,” the Democratic president said as the protestors were escorted out one by one.

Biden and Harris were joined by their spouses, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff, at Tuesday’s rally. It’s the first time the four of them have appeared together since the campaign began, a reflection of the importance that Democrats are putting on abortion this year.

Jill Biden told a story about a friend who became pregnant in high school, years before Roe v. Wade. The friend, she said, needed to get a psychiatric evaluation to be declared mentally unfit before she could get the abortion.

“Secrecy, shame, silence, danger, even death. That’s what defined that time for so many women,” she said. “And because of Dobbs that’s where we’re finding ourselves back again, refighting the battles we had fought.”

Emhoff told the crowd that the fight for abortion rights needed men as well.

“Reproductive freedom is not a woman’s issue,” Emhoff said. “It’s an everyone’s issue.”

The four of them spoke in front of a blue banner that spanned the width of the stage and said “Restore Roe” in bold letters. The crowd hummed with energy, chanting “four more years” and booing Trump’s name, a glimpse of the enthusiasm that has been largely missing from Biden’s low-key events since announcing his reelection campaign last April.

Biden was introduced by Amanda Zurawski, a Texas woman whose water broke only halfway through her pregnancy. Because Roe v. Wade had just been overturned, she was unable to get an abortion until she went into septic shock.

“What I went through was nothing short of barbaric. And it didn’t need to happen,” said Zurawski, who has also testified before Congress and sued Texas along with several other women. “But it did, because of Donald Trump.”

Democrats view Virginia as a success story in their fight for abortion rights since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In last year’s legislative elections, the party maintained control of the Senate and won a majority in the House. It was a defeat for Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who had proposed new limits on abortion and had been considered a potential presidential candidate.

“The voice of the people has been heard and it will be heard,” said Harris, the first woman to serve as vice president.

She also targeted Trump in her speech, describing him as “the architect of this health care crisis” caused by abortion restrictions around the country.

Harris was in Wisconsin on Monday to mark the 51st anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the first stop in a nationwide series of events focused on abortion.

“In America, freedom is not to be given. It is not to be bestowed. It is ours by right,” she said. “And that includes the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body — not the government telling you what to do.”

While Harris and Democrats have embraced abortion as a campaign issue, many Republicans are shying away or calling for a truce, fearful of sparking more backlash from voters.

Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, recently made a plea to “find consensus” on the divisive issue.

“As much as I’m pro-life, I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice, and I don’t want them to judge me for being pro-life,” she said during a primary debate in November.

Trump has taken credit for helping to overturn Roe v. Wade, but he has balked at laws like Florida’s ban on abortions after six weeks, which was signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who dropped out of the Republican nomination race over the weekend.

“You have to win elections,” Trump said during a recent Fox News town hall.

Abortion is also the focus of Biden’s new television advertisement featuring Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Texas who had to leave her state to get an abortion when she learned that her baby had a fatal condition called anencephaly.

“In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy, and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,” Dennard said.

Although Democrats want to restore the federal rights that were established in Roe v. Wade, there’s no chance of that with the current makeup of the Supreme Court and Republican control of the House. The White House is pushing against the limits of its ability to ensure access to abortion.

On Monday, it announced the creation of a team dedicated to helping hospitals comply with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires hospitals receiving federal money to provide life-saving treatment when a patient is at risk of dying.

The Department of Health and Human Services said it would improve training at hospitals concerning the law and publish new information on how to lodge a complaint against a hospital.

Some advocacy groups have said complaints should be enforced more aggressively. Last week, The Associated Press reported that federal officials did not find any violation of the law when an Oklahoma hospital instructed a 26-year-old woman to wait in a parking lot until her condition worsened to qualify for an abortion of her nonviable pregnancy.

Dec 11 2023,Woman at center of Texas abortion controversy travels out of state for legal abortion,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/woman-center-texas-abortion-controversy-travels-abortion,"The woman at the center of a high-profile abortion controversy in Texas has decided to travel out of state to terminate her pregnancy instead of waiting for a decision from the state’s Supreme Court.

Kate Cox, 31, sought an abortion in Texas after her fetus was given a near-fatal diagnosis that also risked harming her own health. A Texas judge granted Cox’s request for an abortion on Thursday, but the request was blocked by the state Supreme Court after a challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Saturday. On Monday, Cox decided to travel out of state to obtain the abortion.

“She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights who represented Cox in her case, said.

Breaking: Kate Cox, 31-year-old woman who asked TX for an emergency abortion, has left the state so she can terminate her pregnancy legally. “She’s been in and out of the emergency room and she couldn’t wait any longer,” said Nancy Northup, head of Center for Reproductive Rights — Elizabeth Landers (@ElizLanders) December 11, 2023

Cox’s fetus, at 21 weeks of gestation, has been diagnosed with trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition that slows growth before birth and often results in miscarriage. Only 5%-10% of children born with trisomy 18 live past their first year of life, with those surviving having severe intellectual disabilities. Texas bans all abortions at the moment of fertilization with a few narrow exceptions for health or life of the mother.

In his challenge to a lower Texas court ruling that first allowed Cox to get an abortion, Paxton argued that the condition did not meet the state’s requirements and threatened to prosecute any hospitals that carried out the abortion.

“The [temporary restraining order] will not insulate you, or anyone else, from civil and criminal liability for violating Texas’ abortion laws,” Paxton wrote.

It is unknown what effect Cox’s travel out of state, where abortions in her case are legal, will have on the case in Texas."

Jul 14 2023,White House & DNC criticize Iowa's new abortion law while anti-abortion groups praise it,KGAN CBS 2,center,https://cbs2iowa.com/news/local/white-house-dnc-criticize-iowas-new-abortion-law-while-anti-abortion-groups-praise-it,"The Biden Administration and National Democratic Committee criticized Iowa's new abortion law Friday while anti-abortion groups praised the bill's signing.

Gov. Kim Reynolds at the Family Leader Summit in Des Moines and a Polk County Judge refused to from going into effect.

Providers were hoping the judge would put a temporary block while it goes through the courts. The judge said he would not make a ruling on it until weighing the options and said a decision would likely come Monday or

The White House called the law ""extreme.""

Full White House statement

Today, Governor Kim Reynolds signed into law an extreme abortion ban that will take away a woman’s right to choose and is just the latest state ban enacted by Republican elected officials following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade one year ago. Iowa’s new law will penalize health care providers and cause delays and denials of health and life-saving care.

While Republican elected officials advance dangerous laws, President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of Americans who believe personal health care decisions should be between a woman and her doctor, not politicians, and will continue to call on Congress to codify the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law. The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to defend access to reproductive health care and fight any attempts to pass a national abortion ban.

DNC Statement

“Governor Kim Reynolds just signed a cruel abortion ban into law among a crowd of extremists who cheered as Iowan women’s abortion rights were stripped away. Iowa’s abortion ban is only the latest show of abortion extremism from MAGA Republicans, all made possible by Donald Trump and the conservative justices he appointed who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade. MAGA Republicans won’t stop their crusade against abortion until they rip away the freedom of every woman in every state to make their own health care decisions.”

National Right to Life

Anti-abortion groups praised the bill's signing on Friday. National Right to Life thanked Gov. Reynolds and the Iowa Legislature for passing it.

“They were committed to seeing this legislation pass and we honor them! We are proud to stand beside Governor Reynolds, the pro-life legislators, and members of our Iowa Coalition of Pro-Life Leaders.”

“The mission of our adversaries is to see more babies killed by abortion, but we will continue to advocate for life and will not stop fighting until abortion becomes unthinkable. We want to see lives saved and women no longer placed in harm’s way because of abortion.”"
Sep 28 2023,Casper woman sentenced to 5 years in prison for abortion clinic arson,Oil City News,center,https://oilcity.news/crime/2023/09/28/casper-woman-sentenced-to-5-years-in-prison-for-abortion-clinic-arson,"CASPER, Wyo. — A Casper woman was sentenced to 60 months in prison for setting fire to the Wellspring Health Access clinic in Casper on May 25, 2022.

Lorna Roxanne Green, 22, was formally charged with arson of a facility engaged in interstate commerce, which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.

She was also ordered to pay restitution. The most recent figure is around $273,000, according to Green’s attorney, Ryan Semerad. Final terms, including consideration of Green’s ability to pay, will be finalized within 90 days.

The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson at the federal courthouse in Cheyenne on Thursday, Sept. 28.

“No amount of money can ease the fear and devastation we all felt,” the clinic’s president, Julie Burkhart, said at sentencing. “It is something we will carry for the rest of our lives.”

Semerad asked Judge Johnson to consider that Green had acted independently and without the intention to spread fear or personally intimidate clinic staff.

Judge Johnson noted that Green was a “complex” defendant, and that though she appeared gifted and talented, her beliefs did not justify the terror she caused.

The clinic made the news in April 2022 as it was poised to become the first in Wyoming to offer medical abortions among its services in family planning, STI testing and gender-affirming care.

Green pleaded guilty last summer to breaking into the facility, pouring gasoline and starting the fire during the early morning hours of May 25, 2022, several weeks before the clinic was set to open.

Green said at the change-of-plea hearing in July that she “knew right after” that her actions were wrong, according to the Associated Press.

The federal complaint filed in the case states that Green was living in Laramie at the time of the arson. She told investigators she purchased the gas cans and aluminum basting pans in Laramie, drove straight to clinic and then drove back after setting the fire.

The FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms assisted the Casper Police Department in the investigation.

Police responded that morning around 3:49 a.m. when a man in the apartment next door to the clinic got up to use the restroom and heard glass breaking outside.

Police arrived to find smoke coming out of the facility and called the fire department. The early response likely spared the clinic from more extensive damage, the complaint noted.

The clinic’s founders told police that security cameras had been installed just a few days prior. Images of the masked suspect were quickly released, along with a $10,000 reward offer for information.

At of the beginning of March 2023, police had exhausted every lead, the complaint noted. With the help of an anonymous donor, the Casper Police Department upped the reward for information to $15,000 on March 3.

Four of the 12 leads generated identified Lorna Green as the suspect, according to the complaint.

A subsequent review of Green’s Instagram photos revealed that she bore a strong physical resemblance to the suspect. It was also learned that Green drove a beige 2007 Corolla, matching a vehicle seen on the clinic’s exterior security cameras.

An Instagram picture of Green also showed her wearing a shoe that matched the model and brand of the suspect’s shoes from the night of the arson.

Green was arrested in Casper on March 21. She told investigators that “she did not like abortion and was having nightmares which she attributed to her anxiety about the the abortion clinic opening, so she decided to burn the building,” the complaint stated.

Soon after news of the clinic’s opening was spread last year, anti-abortion advocates began gathering on a weekly basis outside the facility on the 2nd Street thoroughfare and have continued to do ever since.

Lauren Rankin, the clinic’s spokesperson, told Oil City News on Wednesday that there have been no further acts of violence.

She also directed Oil City News to findings of the peer-reviewed Turnaway Study, which posits that denying women access to abortions results in worse financial, health and family outcomes.

Anti-abortion advocates have told Oil City in the past that they believe human life should have legal protections beginning at conception. Moral positions on both sides were previously explored at a Casper rally in fall 2021.

The clinic’s founders are among a coalition of advocates, including medical professionals, challenging Wyoming’s near-total ban and medication abortion ban on the grounds that they violate the state constitution’s guarantee of medical autonomy.

“No matter what an individual’s opinions or objectives may be, the use of violence and property destruction to advance them is never acceptable,” U.S. Attorney Nicholas Vassallo said in a DOJ release following the sentencing.

“This was a reckless and serious crime which endangered the community and caused significant financial harm to the clinic’s owner. The sentence imposed today, five years of federal incarceration, appropriately reflects the gravity of Ms. Green’s offense,” Vassallo said."

SALT LAKE CITY — About 200 abortion rights advocates gathered outside of the Salt Lake City-County Building Wednesday to show support to a Utah judge's decision to grant a preliminary injunction to block a new law that would effectively ban abortion clinics.

Despite the injunction, those at the rally at Washington Square said they anticipate an ongoing fight on the issue and gathered to sign petitions.

Community groups such as the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and ACLU of Utah were present throughout, as well as some elected officials.

""As legislators it is our responsibility to protect the health and well-being of all our constituents, regardless of who they are, who they love or their circumstances. This includes protecting access to abortion care, as long as it is our duty to stand up for the rights and well-being of all members of our community,"" said Rep. Angela Romero, D-Salt Lake City.

""We are at a critical point in fighting for reproductive rights and justice. The onslaught of legislation aimed at restricting access to abortion is an attack on our individual freedom and basic human rights. And make no mistake, these laws will have devastating consequences,"" continued Romero.

Dr. Emily Corrigan, an OBGYN practicing in Boise, noted that Idaho has some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation, banning the procedure at all stages of pregnancy. Idaho's abortion law allows the procedure to be performed in cases of rape, incest, or if the mother would die without one.

Idaho's abortion laws also include a penalty of two to five years in prison if convicted of ""abortion trafficking,"" which is helping a minor access abortion across state lines, and the ability to file a civil lawsuit against doctors who perform abortions outside of the outlined exceptions, Corrigan said.

""Fear and confusion still abound across Idaho, resulting in patients (being) denied emergency health care. And those patients are paying the price when the rest of the world is moving forward with reproductive health care rights; Idaho and possibly Utah are moving backwards,"" Corrigan said. ""How many Idaho and American women will have to die before we can all regain the right we had for 50 years? How many of them will have to pay the price?""

Corrigan also pointed to rising waitlists for women to access reproductive and maternal health care due to the growing scarcity of OBGYN physicians in the state.

Before the injunction was granted, HB467 was set to stop the licensing of new abortion clinics after May 2, and effectively ban legal abortions in clinics beginning in January 2024.

Planned Parenthood issued the request to Judge Andrew Stone in a 3rd District Court hearing last Friday to place an injunction on the law. The organization argued that the implementation of HB467 effectively equates to a ban, and often hospitals perform abortions only under certain circumstances.

Licensed clinics provide over 95% of abortions in Utah, and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah health centers are not presently licensed as hospitals, according to Planned Parenthood.

Groups and lawmakers who support the bill have argued the bill is intended to protect the unborn while allowing reasonable exemptions.

Bill sponsor Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield, said during the legislative session that the bill still allows clinics like Planned Parenthood to perform other services such as cervical screenings.

""We in Utah have a long-standing tradition — since before statehood — of protecting the unborn by outlawing abortion. We have compassionate exemptions, and we have compassionate law and services for women who find themselves in a situation, and we as a state ought to support them in making the decision that they need to make. That's what this bill does, in a compassionate and thoughtful way,"" Lisonbee has said.

Ahead of Gov. Spencer Cox's signing of the bill, the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America organization stated, ""Planned Parenthood's days of profiting at the expense of unborn lives in Utah could be numbered.""

""Abortion clinics are not medical facilities,"" said Adam Schwend, the group's western regional director. ""Planned Parenthood and the rest of the abortion industry exist to generate a profit by taking lives of unborn children, rather than to care for patients. They generally do not have to abide by the same regulatory standards as health clinics, and this puts women at risk.""

The preliminary injunction request is a part of the same request filed by Planned Parenthood in 2022 against the state's trigger law that bans abortions except under certain circumstances. The circumstances outlined in Utah's trigger law include rape, incest or serious risk of death to the mother. Stone issued an injunction to prevent that law from going into effect, and it is currently being briefed for consideration by the Utah Supreme Court.

Anti-abortion groups are banking on Ohio to end the movement’s run of state-level losses and create a blueprint for battles in 2024 and beyond. In four weeks, voters in the Buckeye State will decide whether to enshrine abortion protections into the state constitution or be the first to reject an abortion-rights measure since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

“Ohio is the first of a lot to come in the year ahead,” said March for Life President Jeanne Mancini.”That’s why we’re looking even more closely at Ohio: It could easily set the standard.” Six states voted last year on abortion referendums. In all six, including deep-red Kansas, Kentucky and Montana — the anti-abortion side lost, and it wasn’t particularly close."

Sep 08 2023,Florida Supreme Court Considers Upholding Abortion Restrictions,New York Times (News),left,https://nytimes.com/2023/09/08/us/florida-supreme-court-abortion.html,"The Florida Supreme Court’s conservative justices repeatedly questioned on Friday whether the state’s privacy rights extend to abortion as they considered whether to uphold a ban on the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy — a decision that could overturn decades of legal precedent and trigger a far more restrictive ban.

Such a decision would cement Florida’s transformation from a haven for women seeking abortions in the American South to a state with some of the most severe restrictions on the procedure, which were enshrined into law by Republicans who have also shifted the ideological balance of the high court from liberal to conservative.

Should the court affirm the 15-week ban, as expected, that would trigger the more recently approved six-week ban to take effect 30 days later, a dramatic policy shift for a state that up until last year allowed abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Few women know they are pregnant by six weeks, and abortion rights backers say such an early ban amounts to near total prohibition. The justices did not indicate when they would rule.

During a closely watched oral argument in Tallahassee on Friday, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood, the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida and several abortion providers argued that the court should not narrow the scope of the privacy rights that Floridians have relied on for 40 years. The state’s solicitor general countered that the court erred in extending privacy rights to abortion, as it first did in 1989."

Jul 18 2023,Iowa ban on most abortions blocked,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,left,https://arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jul/18/iowa-ban-on-most-abortions-blocked,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- An Iowa judge on Monday temporarily blocked the state's new ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, just days after Gov. Kim Reynolds signed the measure into law.

That means abortion is once again legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy while the courts assess the new law's constitutionality.

The new law prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant.

The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the measure in a rare, all-day special session last week, prompting a legal challenge by the ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic. Judge Joseph Seidlin held a hearing on the matter Friday, but said he would take the issue under advisement -- just as Reynolds signed the bill into law about a mile away.

Abortion providers said they scrambled last week to fit in as many appointments as possible before the governor put pen to paper, preemptively making hundreds of calls to prepare patients for the uncertainty and keeping clinics open late.

Reynolds swiftly put out a statement underscoring her intention to fight the issue all the way to the state Supreme Court.

""The abortion industry's attempt to thwart the will of Iowans and the voices of their elected representatives continues today,"" she said.

The ruling Monday does specify that while the law is temporarily paused, the state's Board of Medicine should proceed with creating rules for enforcement, as the law specifies. That way the guidance for health care providers would be well defined if the law were to be in effect in the future.

There are limited circumstances under the law that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality ""incompatible with life""; or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.

Seidlin specified that his ruling hinges on the ""undue burden"" test, which is an intermediate level of scrutiny that requires laws do not create a significant obstacle to abortion.

The state Supreme Court, in its latest rulings on the issue, said that undue burden remains in effect ""with an invitation to litigate the issue further,"" Seidlin wrote. ""This, perhaps, is the litigation that accepts the invitation.""

Using that standard, abortion advocates are likely right to say the new law violates Iowans' constitutional rights, Seidlin said, which led him to grant the temporary block.

Lawyers for the state argued -- and will likely continue to argue -- that the law should be analyzed using rational basis review, the lowest level of scrutiny to judge legal challenges.

""We are deeply relieved that the court granted this relief so essential health care in Iowa can continue,"" said Abbey Hardy-Fairbanks, medical director of the Iowa City-based Emma Goldman Clinic, in a statement. ""We are also acutely aware that the relief is only pending further litigation and the future of abortion in Iowa remains tenuous and threatened.""

Most Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions, and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected.

Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings, as is now the case in Iowa."
Nov 02 2023,Indiana Supreme Court fines Rokita $250 for Fox News interview on abortion doctor,Chicago Tribune,center,https://chicagotribune.com/suburbs/post-tribune/ct-ptb-rokita-st-1103-20231102-thz6vztfynfmthnxcogrhqdl4e-story.html,"The Indiana Supreme Court issued a “public reprimand” Thursday for Attorney General Todd Rokita for comments he made on Fox News about an Indianapolis abortion doctor.

In a 3-2 decision, the justices wrote that Rokita, who is originally from Munster, admitted to two professional conduct violations in a sworn affidavit, with a third dismissed.

Rokita is ordered to pay $250 in court costs. Chief Justice Loretta Rush and Christopher Goff dissented — arguing his penalty should be stiffer given his role.

In a lengthy statement, Rokita denied wrongdoing.

“First things first: I deny and was not found to have violated anyone’s confidentiality or any laws. I was not fined. And I will continue as Indiana’s duly-elected attorney general,” he wrote.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, IU Health obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Caitlin Bernard told an Indianapolis Star reporter in a July 1, 2022 article that she recently performed an abortion on a 10-year-old Ohio girl. The doctor filed state reports the next day.

Days later on July 13, 2022, Rokita appeared on Fox News calling Bernard an “abortion activist acting as a doctor — with a history of failing to report.”

“We’re gathering the evidence as we speak, and we’re going to fight this to the end, uh, including looking at her licensure if she failed to report,” he added.

His comments — which the justices called “attorney misconduct” — served “no substantial purpose” than to “embarrass” or “burden” Bernard, while possibly “prejudicing” a hearing against her, the justices wrote.

Rokita’s comments on national TV had a “far greater reach” than in another cited discipline case where a county prosecutor wove opinions into a press release on a high-profile murder case sent to a local newspaper.

Rokita filed a federal lawsuit against Indiana University Health in September claiming the state’s largest hospital system violated patient privacy laws when Bernard publicly shared the girl’s story. Rokita’s lawsuit also names IU Healthcare Associates.

Bernard was reprimanded by Indiana’s medical licensing board in May, saying she didn’t abide by privacy laws by speaking publicly about the girl’s treatment. Hospital system officials have argued against that assertion.

Gerson Fuentes, 28, who confessed to raping and impregnating the Ohio girl, was sentenced to life in prison in July.

Sep 25 2023,"Mother to Serve 2 Years for Aiding Daughter's Abortion, Burning Remains",Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/09/25/nebraska-mother-sentenced-years-prison-assisting-daughters-third-trimester-abortion-burning-babys-body,"A Nebraska mother who aided in her daughter’s third trimester chemical abortion and helped burn and bury the baby’s remains was sentenced on Friday to two years in prison.

Jessica Burgess, 42, pleaded guilty in July to tampering with human remains, false reporting, and providing an abortion after at least 20 weeks of gestation — an act which is illegal under state law, NBC News reported.

“Madison County District Judge Mark Johnson sentenced her Friday to one year in prison for each count, with the first two to run concurrently. The sentence for the abortion count was ordered to run after the first two, amounting to a two-year sentence,” according to the report.

Burgess’ attorney sought probation, but the judge “balked at that request,” the report states. The judge countered that Burgess knew she was breaking the state’s abortion law because she initially lied to investigators and went to “extraordinary means” to obtain the abortion pills online instead of through a medical provider.

“I shudder to think, Ms. Burgess, that you have such disrespect for a — call it a human fetus, call it a stillborn child — that you would treat it like yesterday’s trash and not give it some respect in its treatment and disposal,” the judge said. “Our society expects more; it demands more.”

Burgess, who is from Norfolk, Nebraska, admitted during her plea hearing that she helped her then 17-year-old daughter abort her baby. Additional charges of concealing the death of another person and abortion by someone other than a licensed physician were dismissed as part of her plea, the report states.

Her daughter, now-19-year-old Celeste Burgess, was sentenced to 90 days in jail this summer, as well as two years of probation for burning and burying her baby’s body. She was released from jail on September 11, according to the report.

“The abortion, well into the teen’s third trimester, violated Nebraska law at the time that banned abortion after 20 weeks of gestation. Officials have said Jessica Burgess ordered abortion pills online and gave them to her daughter in the spring of 2022,” according to the report.

Norfolk police began investigating the incident after receiving a tip, and eventually secured a search warrant to obtain access to Facebook messages between the mother and daughter. Prosecutors said those messages revealed that the women discussed the abortion, as well as destroying the evidence. Police subsequently found the burned baby’s remains buried in a field north of Norfolk, the report states.

In one of the Facebook messages, Jessica Burgess allegedly told her daughter how to take the abortion pills, court records show. Another message showed Celeste Burgess saying, “I will finally be able to wear jeans.”

It should be noted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends women only take abortion pills up to ten weeks’ gestation — up from the agency’s previous seven-week recommendation. The FDA changed the gestational limit recommendation in 2016, a move which is being challenged in court as part of a larger lawsuit concerning the agency’s approval of the abortion pill.

In May of this year, Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen signed a bill that restricts abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy and outlaws the sexual mutilation of minors in the name of so-called “gender-affirming care.”

Nov 01 2023,"Mother, son charged with kidnapping after police say they took a teenager to Oregon for an abortion",Todays Chronic,left,https://todayschronic.com/mother-son-charged-with-kidnapping-after-police-say-they-took-a-teenager-to-oregon-for-an-abortion,"An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion.

Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl’s mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion.

With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year.

Idaho’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren’t relying on it.

According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend’s house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho.

The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant.

According to court documents, the girl said she was “happy” when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship.

The boyfriend’s mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to “kick her out of their house” if she did.

The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles (885 km) from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl’s cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time.

The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was “mutually agreed upon” between the girl and her son. She said she she never “coerced” anyone into having an abortion.

Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl.

The mother is also facing multiple drug charges.

Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.”

Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment."
Nov 01 2023,MO Secretary of State faces another lawsuit over abortion ballot petition language,KMOV 4,center,https://kmov.com/2023/11/02/mo-secretary-state-faces-another-lawsuit-over-abortion-ballot-petition-language,"ST. LOUIS, Mo. (KMOV) - The Missouri Secretary of State is facing another lawsuit over abortion ballot petition language after a court ruled against the state.

On Tuesday, the Missouri Court of Appeals rejected Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft’s appeal to reverse the decision by a lower court to strike and rewrite the summary statements for six reproductive freedom ballot initiatives.

The months-long legal fight began after a St. Louis area doctor filed a set of petitions with the Secretary of State’s office to pose the question of abortion rights to Missouri voters. The initiative petition process dictates that the secretary of state approves the wording. A judge ruled that the language written by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a staunch opponent of abortion rights and a current candidate for governor, was unfairly biased against the issue and ordered a rewrite with language that was not as inflammatory.

The Western District Court of Appeals heard the case on Monday. The next day, the court issued a ruling.

“The Secretary’s summary statements are replete with politically partisan language. After removal of the inaccurate and partisan language of the Secretary’s summary statements, the circuit court was left with largely unworkable summary statements. The circuit court was authorized to write alternative language to fulfill its responsibility that a fair and sufficient summary statement be certified,” read part of the ruling.

Ashcroft said he plans to file an appeal as early as Wednesday.

Jamie Corley, executive director of the Missouri Women and Family Research Fund, recently filed a similar lawsuit accusing Ashcroft and the State Auditor of misleading language to describe six ballot petitions filed by the Missouri Women and Family Research Fund.

“People do not want a total ban regardless of your political affiliation,” Corley told First Alert 4. “We want something in the middle. We want it to be legal, but we want it to be limited.”

Secretary Ashcroft described one petition as allowing for “dangerous, unregulated and unrestricted abortions.”

“I think they’re scared that if they tell the truth to the people of this state and their initiative petition gets to the ballot people won’t vote for it,” Jay Ashcroft told First Alert 4. “I will continue to fight to make sure the people are told the truth. I don’t care how many times I’m sued.”

There are 17 proposed abortion initiatives fighting to make it to ballots next year. Some of Corley’s proposals allow abortions in the case of rape, incest and fatal fetal abnormalities if someone calls into a crisis hotline--up until 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Other petitions allow abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy or after fetal viability, except if the pregnancy endangers the mother’s life. One version has no restrictions at all.

A ballot initiative needs more than 50% of votes to become law and more than 171,000 signatures by May to get put on a campaign ballot.

Corley said her team plans to start collecting signatures in a few weeks, even as her lawsuit plays out.

Jul 24 2023,Ballot-Initiative Battle: Ohio Pro-Lifers Face Abortion Groups’ Push to Enshrine Abortion in the State Constitution,National Catholic Register,right,https://ncregister.com/news/buckeye-state-s-battle-for-life-2023,"This year’s outcome in the Buckeye State could be a bellwether for similar battles elsewhere in 2024.

Ohio is the most recent battleground in abortion groups’ ongoing efforts to add nearly unlimited abortion access to state constitutions.

As pro-life battles have largely shifted to the states a little over a year out from the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the latest showdown will be in Ohio, where abortion groups are pushing an amendment to the state Constitution that would ensure virtually unlimited access to abortion.

The groups behind the amendment include Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which are coming off successes they had in the 2022 midterm elections in adding language ensuring abortion access to the state Constitutions of California, Michigan and Vermont.

The amendment would add language to the Ohio Constitution, stating that “every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on contraception, fertility treatment, continuing one’s own pregnancy, miscarriage care, and abortion.”

Protect Women Ohio, a coalition of more than 50 pro-life and faith-based organizations, including Ohio Right to Life and the Ohio Catholic Conference, has been fighting the amendment with warnings that it would allow late-term abortions, take away parental rights, and eliminate health and safety requirements.

While the amendment states that “abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability,” it also specifies that “in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”

Peter Range, CEO of Ohio Right to Life, noted that the language of “health,” where abortion past viability is permitted, is a broad definition from the 1973 Supreme Court decision Doe v. Bolton, which includes “all factors, physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the women’s age relevant to the well-being of the mother.”

Michelle Duffey, communications director at the Ohio Catholic Conference, told the Register that while its proponents use the language of taking the state back to the status under Roe, the amendment “actually goes dangerously beyond Roe” by allowing for late-term abortions and “also removing the parental rights and potentially removing a lot of those safety regulations and putting women at risk of abuse.”









Anti-Parent Agenda

Amy Natoce, press secretary for Protect Women Ohio, said that the amendment’s language of an individual’s right to “reproductive decisions” without specifying an age would “completely wipe out parental consent and notification requirements in Ohio so that minors can obtain abortions and even sex-change procedures without parental consent and notification.”

Range told the Register that one of the groups behind the amendment, Urge, states on its website that it is working to “end forced parental-involvement laws” on the abortion issue. He highlighted Planned Parenthood and the ACLU’s argument in court cases in Indiana and Alaska that parental-consent laws created “an unconstitutional undue burden on unemancipated minors.”

Range said it was clear from these public stances from the groups behind the amendment that they have “a targeted agenda to separate parents from their kids on these incredibly important decisions that kids could be making.”

The amendment’s covering of “reproductive decisions, including but not limited to” abortion, he added, is broad enough to include gender-transition surgeries. A legal analysis of the amendment from Carrie Severino and Frank Scaturro of the Judicial Crisis Network in National Review said “a natural reading” of that part of the amendment “would extend to any medical procedure that involves the human reproductive system, including sex-change surgery.”

The amendment also stipulates that the state government “shall not, directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against either an individual’s voluntary exercise of this right or a person or entity that assists an individual exercising this right, unless the State demonstrates that it is using the least restrictive means to advance the individual’s health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.”

Natoce said the way this part of the amendment is worded is dangerous because it could enable predatory behavior and coerced abortions with its broad protection for individuals who assist in obtaining abortions. The Ohio Catholic Conference also listed that as a primary concern, citing a recent study, which found that the “majority of women who have had an abortion report ‘high levels of pressure’ to seek the abortion” and under the language of the amendment, “anyone who transports, counsels, or pressures a woman into an abortion, including abusers, traffickers, and negligent clinicians, would be protected by law.”

Natoce also raised concerns about the amendment eliminating the state’s existing laws if they are deemed a “burden” to abortion access, including its limit on abortion to 22 weeks, parental-consent requirements, and its abortion provider health and safety standards.

In response to a question about parental-consent laws, ACLU of Ohio attorney Jesse Hill said in February, “when you pass a constitutional amendment, it doesn’t just automatically erase everything and start over. But it would mean that laws that conflict with it cannot be enforced, should not be enforced.”

The amendment’s proponents have collected more than 700,000 signatures, considerably more than the required 413,000 signatures to get the issue on the ballot in November. Local officials were scheduled to determine how many of those signatures were valid by July 20 to see if it could appear on the November ballot; but prior to that, there is a potentially game-changing August special election that could raise the amount of votes needed to pass any amendment to the state Constitution. Republican legislators have placed Issue One on the August ballot, a vote on raising the majority needed to amend the state Constitution from its current 50%-plus-one majority, which has been in place for more than 100 years, to 60%.

Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima, is among the state lawmakers advocating the move to require a larger majority of votes to amend the state Constitution. He told the Register that, in the past 20 years, Ohio has gone from being a more divided state politically to more Republican, and outside groups “who do not like what is happening in the legislature or in the executive branch have decided, ‘we’ll just go try to change the Constitution instead.’”

“We have folks who make a lot of money performing abortions, like Planned Parenthood; that’s why they want that enshrined,” he said, but he added that the issue is not only about abortion and referenced the 2009 amendment to the state Constitution, which authorized casinos to come in, as well as more recent efforts to legalize marijuana in the state Constitution.

Regarding the abortion amendment, he said that as information spreads about what it would mean for parental rights and late-term abortion, he thinks Ohioans will reject it. “I think there’s a chance they could get an excess of 50%,” he said. “It won’t get an excess of 60%, which is why it’s important to vote ‘Yes’ on Aug. 8.”









Outside Interest Groups

Natoce said that raising the threshold will “protect the [state] Constitution from these out-of-state special interest groups like the ACLU that so often try to come into our state with this outside money and buy their way into the [Ohio] Constitution.” She added that the August special election “will certainly have a bearing on what happens in November.”

She pointed out that just 18 states allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments and, of those, several states require larger majorities for their passage, including a 60% requirement in Florida, a 55% requirement in Colorado, and a 66% requirement in New Hampshire.

While the vote on the amendment regarding abortion will be affected by the August election, she said that what the election “is really about is protecting Ohio’s Constitution from outside groups. This is not a new phenomenon of outside groups coming into the state and coming in with their truckloads of money and trying to circumvent the legislative process and buy their way into the [Ohio] Constitution.”

Some former Ohio GOP governors and attorneys general who are opposed to the amendment have voiced concerns about such a significant vote taking place in an August election, which typically sees lower turnout. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose believes the advertisements and press coverage of the issue will drive up turnout.

Range said that Ohio Right to Life is supporting a “Yes” vote on raising the threshold because “we just recognize that Ohio’s Constitution is an incredibly important document, and it needs to be protected,” and “it’s not protected right now.”

Duffey said the bishops are neutral on the issue of raising the threshold to amend the state Constitution, referencing their statement that they “do not have a position on Issue 1, as it does not have moral content. However, as ‘responsible citizenship is a virtue, and participation in political life is a moral obligation’ (‘Faithful Citizenship,’ No. 13), the bishops urge Catholics in Ohio to register and vote in the special election.”

Clarke Forsythe, legal counsel at Americans United for Life, told the Register that raising the majority required to amend the state’s Constitution makes sense, as “supermajority measures are throughout state constitutions and the federal Constitution.”

The abortion amendment in nearby Michigan passed with just under 57% of the vote, which is under the proposed 60% higher threshold in the August election, but pro-lifers in Ohio say, regardless of what happens in August, they are hopeful about their chances in November.

One thing Natoce said sets apart the efforts in Ohio is that Protect Women Ohio “came out of the gate early with advertisements to define the issue.” When the ACLU and other groups began collecting signatures in mid-March for the initiative, Protect Women Ohio responded with a $5-million ad buy and door-to-door canvassers, talking to voters to “let Ohioans know that this goes directly after their rights as parents and goes directly after the unborn, stripping away all protections.”

Duffey believes the situation in Ohio is very different from Michigan, where the timing of the leak of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe put pro-lifers “in an even more defensive state from the beginning.”









‘A Spiritual Battle’

Come November, Ohio will serve as the latest test on the issue since the disappointing 2022 midterm outcomes for pro-lifers on state ballot initiatives. Many will be watching its outcome closely, as abortion advocates plan similar efforts to add abortion to state constitutions in 11 states in 2024, including Florida, South Dakota and Missouri.

Forsythe anticipated that “any state that has a ballot-initiative procedure, it’s a reasonable possibility; abortion advocates could run an initiative in the state if they think they can make it on the ballot.”

Ohio Right to Life’s Range views the amendment efforts in Ohio as part of “a much larger battle” taking place “across the country for parental rights to ensure that parents have a say in their kids’ decisions” and “for life, whether or not a child will be able to breathe the common air, to have a chance at life.”

He viewed this as “fundamentally a spiritual battle” and encouraged people of faith to pray for the success of the pro-life side in these battles, expressing gratitude for the prayers of the Ohio bishops.

Ohio’s bishops also have been encouraging the faithful to pray and fast against this amendment. Part of that has included handing out prayer cards in parishes across the dioceses, with a “Prayer for Ohio” on the back that has a special appeal for the intercession of Mary and Joseph, who “welcomed Jesus into our broken world” to “help us build a civilization of love by upholding the sacredness of life, preserving parental rights, and accompanying pregnant women in need.”"

“We have folks who make a lot of money performing abortions, like Planned Parenthood; that’s why they want that enshrined,” he said, but he added that the issue is not only about abortion and referenced the 2009 amendment to the state Constitution, which authorized casinos to come in, as well as more recent efforts to legalize marijuana in the state Constitution.

Regarding the abortion amendment, he said that as information spreads about what it would mean for parental rights and late-term abortion, he thinks Ohioans will reject it. “I think there’s a chance they could get an excess of 50%,” he said. “It won’t get an excess of 60%, which is why it’s important to vote ‘Yes’ on Aug. 8.”









Outside Interest Groups

Natoce said that raising the threshold will “protect the [state] Constitution from these out-of-state special interest groups like the ACLU that so often try to come into our state with this outside money and buy their way into the [Ohio] Constitution.” She added that the August special election “will certainly have a bearing on what happens in November.”

She pointed out that just 18 states allow citizen-initiated constitutional amendments and, of those, several states require larger majorities for their passage, including a 60% requirement in Florida, a 55% requirement in Colorado, and a 66% requirement in New Hampshire.

While the vote on the amendment regarding abortion will be affected by the August election, she said that what the election “is really about is protecting Ohio’s Constitution from outside groups. This is not a new phenomenon of outside groups coming into the state and coming in with their truckloads of money and trying to circumvent the legislative process and buy their way into the [Ohio] Constitution.”

Some former Ohio GOP governors and attorneys general who are opposed to the amendment have voiced concerns about such a significant vote taking place in an August election, which typically sees lower turnout. Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose believes the advertisements and press coverage of the issue will drive up turnout.

Range said that Ohio Right to Life is supporting a “Yes” vote on raising the threshold because “we just recognize that Ohio’s Constitution is an incredibly important document, and it needs to be protected,” and “it’s not protected right now.”

Duffey said the bishops are neutral on the issue of raising the threshold to amend the state Constitution, referencing their statement that they “do not have a position on Issue 1, as it does not have moral content. However, as ‘responsible citizenship is a virtue, and participation in political life is a moral obligation’ (‘Faithful Citizenship,’ No. 13), the bishops urge Catholics in Ohio to register and vote in the special election.”

Clarke Forsythe, legal counsel at Americans United for Life, told the Register that raising the majority required to amend the state’s Constitution makes sense, as “supermajority measures are throughout state constitutions and the federal Constitution.”

The abortion amendment in nearby Michigan passed with just under 57% of the vote, which is under the proposed 60% higher threshold in the August election, but pro-lifers in Ohio say, regardless of what happens in August, they are hopeful about their chances in November.

One thing Natoce said sets apart the efforts in Ohio is that Protect Women Ohio “came out of the gate early with advertisements to define the issue.” When the ACLU and other groups began collecting signatures in mid-March for the initiative, Protect Women Ohio responded with a $5-million ad buy and door-to-door canvassers, talking to voters to “let Ohioans know that this goes directly after their rights as parents and goes directly after the unborn, stripping away all protections.”

Duffey believes the situation in Ohio is very different from Michigan, where the timing of the leak of the Dobbs decision overturning Roe put pro-lifers “in an even more defensive state from the beginning.”









‘A Spiritual Battle’

Come November, Ohio will serve as the latest test on the issue since the disappointing 2022 midterm outcomes for pro-lifers on state ballot initiatives. Many will be watching its outcome closely, as abortion advocates plan similar efforts to add abortion to state constitutions in 11 states in 2024, including Florida, South Dakota and Missouri.

Forsythe anticipated that “any state that has a ballot-initiative procedure, it’s a reasonable possibility; abortion advocates could run an initiative in the state if they think they can make it on the ballot.”

Ohio Right to Life’s Range views the amendment efforts in Ohio as part of “a much larger battle” taking place “across the country for parental rights to ensure that parents have a say in their kids’ decisions” and “for life, whether or not a child will be able to breathe the common air, to have a chance at life.”

He viewed this as “fundamentally a spiritual battle” and encouraged people of faith to pray for the success of the pro-life side in these battles, expressing gratitude for the prayers of the Ohio bishops.

Ohio’s bishops also have been encouraging the faithful to pray and fast against this amendment. Part of that has included handing out prayer cards in parishes across the dioceses, with a “Prayer for Ohio” on the back that has a special appeal for the intercession of Mary and Joseph, who “welcomed Jesus into our broken world” to “help us build a civilization of love by upholding the sacredness of life, preserving parental rights, and accompanying pregnant women in need.”"

Access to safe abortion, reproductive rights and marijuana legalization are some top issues for Democrats.

Del. Don Scott is likely to become Virginia’s next speaker of the House after Democrats took control of the State House and maintained control of the State Senate.

Norfolk Reproductive rights appear to be big issue for Hampton Roads voters Colter Anstaett

""Since the Democrats will have control of the Senate and House, what does this mean for reproductive rights and access to abortion?"" News 3's Leondra Head asked Scott.

""It means that reproductive healthcare and access to abortion safe, legal and accessible will be enshrined in our constitution,"" Scott said.

Currently, Virginia state law bans abortion after 26 weeks. Governor Glenn Youngkin has proposed a 15-week abortion ban.

Now that democrats will have control of the general assembly, Scott says they plan to add an amendment to the Virginia constitution regarding abortion access.

""We’ll be introducing a constitution amendment either this session or the very next one,"" Scott said. ""I know we’ll get it done in one of these next two sessions.""

For an amendment to be voted on, it must be voted on twice.

Scott said says an amendment would ""enshrine the language that’s in Roe V. Wade and enshrine the current law in the Commonwealth of Virginia.""

Another hot topic is marijuana. Anyone over 21-years-old can possess up to an ounce of marijuana in Virginia and can grow four marijuana plants at their residence. However selling recreational marijuana in the state is illegal.

Scott says that could change.

""We made it legal,"" Scott said. ""But we haven’t made the sell of marijuana legal, and we need to fix that. There’s an opportunity right now. The marijuana market in Virginia is a $8 billion market. It’s not being taxed, but folks are using it.""

""We can use some of those resources to improve child care, improve mental health resources and use some of that tax revenue and make adult use legalization legal,"" Scott said.

News 3's Leondra Head spoke to Nicholas Rochas, the owner of Queens Green Apothecary CBD store in Virginia Beach.

""Delegate Scott hinted at making the sale of marijuana legal in Virginia. You’re a CBD shop owner. What would that mean for CBD shops in Virginia?"" News 3's Leondra Head asked Rochas.

""This type of legislation would help push through and move forward the recreational market,"" Rochas said. ""It’s a real big win for Virginia.""

Over the summer, Governor Glenn Youngkin signed a law that makes Delta 8 THC illegal.

""It’s natural to see Delta 8 and Delta 10 will go away when Delta 9, full blown marijuana gets legalized from a recreational standpoint,"" Rochas said.

Delegate Scott says Democrats plan to tackle several issues head on when the General Assembly is back in session in January."

Oct 31 2023,Judge blocks law requiring doctors to tell patients about discredited 'abortion reversal',Law & Crime,center,https://lawandcrime.com/abortion/judge-blocks-law-requiring-doctors-to-tell-patients-about-discredited-abortion-reversal,"A Kansas judge blocked an “abortion reversal” law Monday, ruling that the state’s requirement that doctors advise patients about the possibility of “reversing” a medication abortion is a free speech violation based on junk science that turns the informed consent process upside down and makes patients “likely to be less informed—not more.”

The ruling blocks portions of a longstanding set of abortion regulations, including the 24-hour waiting period, plus a new requirement that providers recite a script that informs patients that medication abortions can be “reversed.” The claim that an abortion conducted through the use of Mifepristone — the first pill in a commonly-used two-medication abortion regimen — can be “reversed” through doses of other drugs is not accepted science with the medical industry.

Judge K. Christopher Jayaram, a judge appointed by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly in 2021, issued the 92-page ruling on Monday in the case of Hodes & Nauser v. Kobach. The lawsuit involves the 1997 “Woman’s-Right-to-Know” Act, which requires doctors to obtain written proof of a patient’s informed consent within 24 hours before having an abortion. The original law required an extensive list of specific points that doctors were required to cover with their patients. Over the next decade, the act was amended multiple times, each iteration adding to the exhaustive mandates required of doctors.

In 2023, after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, the Kansas legislature adopted H.B. 2264, an amendment known as the “Medication Abortion Reversal” Amendment.

The amendment, passed over Kelly’s veto, required that a number of warnings and offers of “reversal” be given to anyone seeking a medication abortion. It further required that a “conspicuous sign” be posted at private offices, freestanding clinics, pharmacies, and anywhere else mifepristone is dispensed, as follows:

NOTICE TO PATIENTS HAVING MEDICATION ABORTIONS THAT USE MIFEPRISTONE: Mifepristone, also known as RU–486 or mifeprex, alone is not always effective in ending a pregnancy. It may be possible to reverse its intended effect if the second pill or tablet has not been taken or administered. If you change your mind and wish to try to continue the pregnancy, you can get immediate help by accessing available resources.

The law created a $10,000 per day penalty for violations of the signage requirement and allowed for doctors to be criminally prosecuted. Additionally, the act mandates that non-compliance constitutes “unprofessional conduct” for purposes of medical licensing.

The judge’s ruling Monday blocked enforcement of the law on the grounds that it likely violates both state and federal law.

Jayaram reasoned that, “Because a woman’s right to bodily autonomy (including her right to decide whether to terminate or continue a pregnancy) is fundamental,” and because the doctor-patient relationship is “intimate and intensely-personal,” the law fails under standards set out under the Kansas State Constitution.

Likewise, he said that despite any “specific moral, ethical, or spiritual concerns” that might weigh in favor of the law, the law appears a clear violation of the First Amendment.

Jayaram listed a number of relevant facts in his ruling: that abortion is a common procedure and statistically safer than carrying a pregnancy to term, that the majority of women who have abortions have already given birth to other children, that nearly all abortions in Kansas are performed early in pregnancy, and that women typically invest significant time, research, discussion, and thought prior to making an appointment for an abortion.

Furthermore, Jayaram said, doctors go through a robust discussion process with patients as part of standard medical practice. Requiring that they advise patients about abortion “reversal” is dangerous and misleading, the judge said:

There is no credible scientific/medical evidence that the “reversal” therapy proposed in the Amendment actually “reverses” the effects of mifepristone. Indeed, the overwhelming weight of credible evidence, given this record, suggests that such a theory is misleading, untested, potentially-dangerous for women, and speculative.

The judge also called out the state’s witnesses for offering evidence in support of “reversal” that was “not credible or grounded in established and appropriately peer-reviewed and validated science.”

Jayaram reminded that it is already well-established law that the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights protects “the right to control one’s own body, to assert bodily integrity, and to exercise self determination” as a fundamental right which is “separate, distinct, and broader than the protections contemplated under the United States’ Constitution.” As a result, an infringement on the right to terminate a pregnancy is subject to strict scrutiny: valid only if narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest — and this act does not.

Although the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson decision eradicated a right to abortion itself under the U.S. Constitution, the right to free speech under the First Amendment remained unchanged by the ruling. Jayaram concluded therefore that under standard First Amendment jurisprudence, H.B. 2264 is as an unconstitutional violation of free speech.

The judge reasoned that through the act, Kansas is “‘wedging’ its way into the physician-patient relationship…[and] infring[ing] on a woman’s fundamental right to bodily autonomy.” He said that requiring doctors to make statements about abortion “reversal,” “invades that physician-patient relationship,” and, “places a figurative ‘thumb’ on the decision-making scale by advocating for the State’s preferred message and outcome.”

Jayaram said the act’s invasiveness goes even beyond interference and requires illegally compelled speech without a valid purpose. Plus, he pointed out, subjecting patients to a deluge of unnecessary communications can actually thwart the informed consent process.

He wrote:

By overwhelming patients with information other than that strictly necessary to reach an informed decision on the procedure at issue, both orally and in writing in multiple locations at multiple times, the significance of the material medical information conveyed appears likely to be diluted, and the consent seems potentially likely to be less informed — not more.

Jayaram concluded his lengthy decision with an acknowledgment that “Reasonable minds can and do, unquestionably, diverge as to the propriety and permissibility of terminating a pregnancy.”

“This Court is deeply aware of the strongly-held and very personal beliefs on both sides of these issues,” he continued, but qualified that the court “will not, and need not wade into such ideologic debates” to analyze the legality of Kansas’ law.

The judge warned that Kansas’ right to legislate “pursuant to its own moral scruples” is limited by the guarantees the state itself adopted in its constitution.

Traci Lynn Nauser, the board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist who is one of the plaintiffs in the case, reacted to the ruling in a statement Monday:

This ruling represents a hard-fought win for our patients all across Kansas and in neighboring states where abortion is banned. While there is still a long road ahead to ensure that Kansans are able to access timely abortion care without facing barriers, we are grateful that we can continue to provide accurate, patient-centered information to those who trust us with their care.

Anti-abortion group Kansans for Life criticized the ruling as “a nightmare for women and a dream come true for the profit-driven abortion industry.”

Jessica Burgess and her daughter were accused of acting together to terminate the pregnancy of Celeste Burgess in April 2022.

The 41-year-old mother ordered the pills online and gave them to her daughter, who was 17 at the time and in her third trimester, the Times reported Friday, citing prosecutors.

Authorities said the family then buried the aborted fetus.

Abortion beyond the legal limit of 20 weeks

In April of this year, police began investigating suspicions that Celeste Burgess gave birth prematurely to a stillborn child, whom they buried together.

In July, the girl was sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to concealing human remains.

Her mother, Jessica, pleaded guilty in July to violating Nebraska’s abortion law, providing false information to a police officer and removing or concealing human remains.

Celeste Burgess, who was released earlier this month, was in the courtroom wiping away tears when her mother was sentenced Friday, according to the Daily News.

The 41-year-old mother was facing five charges, including one under a 2010 law that only allows abortion up to 20 weeks after fertilization.

On June 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court overturned a federal ruling that had guaranteed abortion rights nationwide since 1973. Since then, each state has been free to set its own abortion access policy.

But about ten states have banned abortions, forcing clinics to close or relocate. (AFP)"

(WOWT/Gray News) - The mother of a teen at the center of an illegal abortion case in northeast Nebraska has been sentenced to prison.

Jessica Burgess was sentenced Friday to two years in prison in Madison County District Court for removing or concealing a dead human body, false reporting, and performing an abortion past 20 weeks’ gestation.

Burgess had been ordered by Judge Mark A. Johnson at her attorney’s request to receive a psychological evaluation before her sentencing. That was rescinded because of a “lack of funding,” according to court documents.

Her daughter Celeste Burgess, now 19 years old, was sentenced in July to 90 days in jail and two years of probation after pleading guilty to one count of removing a dead human body in May.

Celeste Burgess, 17 at the time, was initially charged after authorities said she took pills to abort her 29-week-old fetus. Nebraska law at the time allowed for abortion up to 20 weeks; the current law allows for up to 12 weeks.

Authorities also said she had set the fetus on fire and disposed of its body in a Madison County field.

Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature failed this year to enact a six-week ban on abortions, but later passed a 12-week ban after adding it as an amendment to another bill limiting gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The American Civil Liberties Union has sued to overturn the abortion ban and transgender care bill, citing a Nebraska constitutional requirement that legislative bills stick to a single subject.

Both the legislative action and the sentencings in the Norfolk case came in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to overturn Roe v. Wade, which for 50 years had established a constitutional right to abortion.

Jul 13 2023,Iowa abortion ban draws challenge,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,left,https://arkansasonline.com/news/2023/jul/13/iowa-abortion-ban-draws-challenge,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa's new ban on most abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy was challenged in court on Wednesday, launching what will likely be a lengthy and emotional legal battle just hours after the Legislature approved it in a late-night vote.

Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds says she'll sign the bill into law on Friday. It would take effect immediately.

The bill was passed with exclusively Republican support in a rare, one-day legislative session lasting more than 14 hours. There were vocal -- and sometimes tense -- objections from Democratic lawmakers and abortion advocates protesting at the Capitol.

The challenge, brought by the ACLU of Iowa, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the Emma Goldman Clinic, requests that a district court temporarily put the soon-to-be law on hold as the courts assess its constitutionality. A hearing is scheduled for Friday afternoon, according to court documents, just before the governor's bill signing.

Abortion is currently legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy, but that would change with the stroke of Reynolds' pen Friday. The new legislation prohibits almost all abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy and before many women know they are pregnant.

Reynolds ordered the special session after Iowa's Supreme Court declined in June to reinstate a practically identical law that she signed in 2018. She called the new bill a vindication of her earlier efforts.

""The Iowa Supreme Court questioned whether this legislature would pass the same law they did in 2018, and today they have a clear answer,"" Reynolds said in a statement. ""Justice for the unborn should not be delayed.""

There are limited circumstances under the measure that would allow for abortion after the point in a pregnancy where cardiac activity is detected: rape, if reported to law enforcement or a health provider within 45 days; incest, if reported within 145 days; if the fetus has a fetal abnormality ""incompatible with life""; or if the pregnancy is endangering the life of the pregnant woman.

Planned Parenthood North Central States said Wednesday they are preparing to have to refer patients to other states if the law isn't blocked. As of Wednesday, 200 patients were scheduled for abortions at Iowa Planned Parenthood or the Emma Goldman Clinic this week and next, according to the court filings. Most of them are past the six-week mark in their pregnancies.

""We are seeking to block the ban because we know that every day this law is in effect, Iowans will face life-threatening barriers to getting desperately needed medical care -- just as we have seen in other states with similar bans,"" Rita Bettis Austen, legal director for the ACLU of Iowa, said in a statement.

Most Republican-led states have drastically limited abortion access in the year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and handed authority on abortion law to the states. More than a dozen states have bans with limited exceptions and one state, Georgia, bans abortion after cardiac activity is detected. Several other states have similar restrictions that are on hold pending court rulings.

A district court in Iowa found the state's 2018 abortion ban unconstitutional in 2019, which at the time was based on rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and Iowa's Supreme Court that had affirmed a woman's fundamental constitutional right to abortion.

After both bodies overturned those rulings last year, the governor sought to reinstate the 2018 law. But the state's high court deadlocked last month without ruling on the merits of an abortion ban, leaving that law permanently blocked and leaving open the question of how the courts would rule on a new one."

Nov 08 2023,"Republicans burned by abortion restrictions at ballot box, can’t shake ‘ban’ rhetoric from Dems",Washington Times,right,https://washingtontimes.com/news/2023/nov/8/republicans-burned-abortion-restrictions-ballot-bo,"Some pundits tried to pin the latest Republican election losses on former President Donald Trump, but the trouncing Tuesday was more likely tied to the party’s stance on limiting abortion, which it has struggled to define for more than a year since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Republicans’ muddled messaging on abortion could spell disaster for the party in 2024.

Republican losses in Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Pennsylvania indicate abortion is a leading issue among voters. Those driven to the polls Tuesday rejected the party’s efforts to limit the procedure, even at 15 weeks, which a slim majority of Americans support.

“Elections all around the country had one overriding message: The pro-abortion-rights majority is still angry about the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future,” University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato told The Washington Times.

Democrats now see the Republicans’ abortion quandary as their path to victory in 2024, when the House, Senate and White House are up for grabs.

“Every time MAGA Republicans bring their abortion bans to the ballot box, they lose,” said Rep. James McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat. “Americans are making our voices heard, and we believe medical decisions are between a patient and doctor — not a patient and a GOP politician on a power trip.”

SEE ALSO: Biden campaign says Trump can’t have it both ways on abortion issue

The Supreme Court’s landmark decision to overturn Roe in June 2022 ended federally legalized abortion and sent decisions about the procedure back to the states. Two election cycles later, Republicans are beginning to see that their long-sought ruling is crushing them in elections.

A July AP/NORC poll found that 51% of adults support keeping abortion legal up to 15 weeks of pregnancy. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, campaigned on that limit as he sought to define the Democratic position as extreme and without any limits at all.

The proposed restriction didn’t sell with voters in Virginia, a once-conservative state that has leaned increasingly Democratic. It drove enough Democrats to the polls to dash Mr. Youngkin’s hope that Republicans would win control of the Statehouse.

Instead, voters flipped the Republican-led Senate and returned full control of the legislature to Democrats, blocking Republicans from implementing abortion restrictions and dimming Mr. Youngkin’s allure as a rising Republican star.

Republicans lost the governor’s race in Kentucky. Voters in Ohio easily passed a citizen-sponsored measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. In Pennsylvania, Democrat and abortion rights advocate Dan McCaffery won the open seat on the state Supreme Court.

Last year, Republicans suffered a similar thrashing in the midterm elections. The abortion issue helped sink Republican candidates in swing-state races. Pro-choice turnout helped keep the Senate under Democratic control and limited the House Republican takeover to just a handful of seats.

In October, Mr. Youngkin’s political action committee spent $1.4 million on an ad campaign to dispel Democrats’ claim that a Republican-controlled Statehouse would pursue an outright abortion ban, which under current Virginia law is permitted for up to 26 weeks.

In proposing the 15-week limit with some exceptions, Mr. Youngkin sought the middle ground — far from the six-week abortion ban pushed by the most conservative wing of the party, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Mr. Youngkin’s 15-week gambit “didn’t work either,” Mr. Sabato said.

The party may have to consider another option, he said: “Avoid talking about it and change the subject.”

Democrats won’t let Republicans duck the issue.

In Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear overcame President Biden’s unpopularity in his conservative state to defeat Republican Daniel Cameron and win a second term.

Democrats in Kentucky made abortion limits a central campaign issue.

Mr. Beshear bashed Mr. Cameron repeatedly about the Republican Party’s anti-abortion stance. A Beshear campaign ad featured a woman who was raped by her stepfather at age 12. She questioned the state’s current abortion ban, which prohibits the procedure even in cases of rape and incest.

“I don’t think it’s a big secret, but in many states, abortion is not a winning issue for Republicans,” Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a former Republican presidential nominee, told The Times. “The winning issue relates to the economy and the cost of living. People are suffering high costs of food, gasoline, housing, health care, and they want to see people who can improve their lives. So focusing on abortion didn’t turn out to be a big winner. I think you would not find that as a surprise.”

The most ardent pro-life wing of the Republican Party on Wednesday rejected the notion of backing away from efforts to limit abortion.

Pro-life Republicans said the party did a poor job uniting behind a message of protecting the life of the unborn and failed to show voters that the Democrats’ position supporting limitless abortion is extreme.

“We have to unite our party together to fight their radical stance on abortion and win in 2024,” said Mercedes Schlapp, who worked as a communications director in the Trump White House and now hosts the nation’s largest annual conservative gathering, the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Sen. Cynthia M. Lummis, Wyoming Republican, said navigating the abortion issue may not be that simple for the party.

“I think that we need to acknowledge that Americans really value and cherish their individual constitutional rights regardless of whether they ever intend to use them,” she said. “We as Republicans need to take that and try to move forward, and not change our core values, but remember that the core values of the individual American also involve the freedom to be an American. It’s going to be a huge challenge for us.”

Mr. Trump has distanced himself from bans on abortion in the first term of pregnancy.

He blamed Mr. Cameron’s loss in Kentucky on his Republican nemesis, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a fellow Kentuckian who endorsed Mr. Cameron but whose approval ratings have dipped.

Mr. Trump took credit for the Republicans’ only big win: the reelection in conservative Mississippi of Republican Gov. Tate Reeves. He said Mr. Reeves “surged after my involvement.”

In September, Mr. Trump called the six-week ban endorsed by Mr. DeSantis, arguably his top but distant opponent for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, “a terrible thing and a terrible mistake.”

The former president said he opposes abortion bans that do not include exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.

“In order to win in 2024, Republicans must learn how to talk about Abortion,” Mr. Trump said in a September post on Truth Social.

Asked by NBC News how he would navigate the abortion issue if elected, Mr. Trump predicted he would come up with a successful solution that would allow the Republicans to finally put the issue behind them. “I’m going to come together with all groups,” Mr. Trump said. “And we’re going to have something that’s acceptable.”

“Ohio, there’s an important election happening right now,” the Democrat said on X, the website formerly known as Twitter. “If you want to protect abortion rights by making them part of your state Constitution, vote yes on Issue 1.”"
Nov 08 2023,"Abortion rights win out in 2023 elections, showing GOP hasn't found footing for 2024",Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/abortion-rights-2023-election-republicans-democrats-vote,"Abortion rights won out in several key races in Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky on Election Day, signaling support for abortion access in the 2024 election and a need for the anti-abortion movement to regroup for next year.

Ohioans voted on Tuesday to add a comprehensive reproductive rights amendment to their state constitution, enshrining the right to abortion and placing strict restrictions on the state legislature’s capacity to regulate the procedure.

DEMOCRATS SPOOKED AFTER BIDEN SHOCK POLL AND FRET TRUMP WHITE HOUSE COMEBACK

Advocates of the amendment rallied support for it in response to a measure signed by Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) to ban abortion after six weeks gestation, which had not been enforced due to continued legal challenges.

In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA) branded the off-cycle elections for the House and Senate as a referendum on his leadership and as an opportunity to gain enough support for a ban on abortion at 15 weeks gestation, the point at which a fetus can feel pain in the womb.

Democrats in the purple state were able to flip the state House and maintain control of the Senate, both by slim majorities.

Meanwhile, incumbent Gov. Andy Beshear (D-KY) was able to leverage the anti-abortion record of his opponent, Daniel Cameron, who, during the campaign, flip-flopped on his position of adding rape and incest exceptions to the state’s total ban on abortion.

Abortion rights have become a larger topic in state-level elections since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, making the regulation of the procedure a state matter. The 2022 midterm elections were also dominated by abortion, with strong anti-abortion Republicans losing more ground in the House and Senate than anticipated.

Anti-abortion advocates have already taken note that their strategy needs to change ahead of the 2024 elections to advance their policy goals.

Human life begins at the moment of fertilization. Abortion is an act of homicidal violence that kills a living… — Lila Rose (@LilaGraceRose) November 8, 2023



“The pro-life movement must adapt to win,” said Lila Rose, president of the anti-abortion network Live Action. “We have to throw out the old playbook and dive headfirst into a strategy that can win the hearts and minds of the American people and translate into electoral victory.”

Anti-abortion group SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser reacted similarly, saying that activists advocating anti-abortion candidates or against pro-abortion ballot measures in the 2024 cycle “will need to devote more resources to compassionate pro-life messages for women and their children, combating the campaign of fear from the other side.”

Democratic politicians across the board celebrated Tuesday’s victory.

“Voters turned out to safeguard reproductive rights and prevent extremists from enforcing an abortion ban that would harm women and criminalize doctors,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in response to the Ohio amendment. “Since the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, people across the country have voted to defend reproductive freedom every time it has appeared on the ballot.”

“Abortion is a kitchen table issue,” Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) said late on Tuesday night. “Republicans don’t have a messaging problem, they have a policy problem.”

In September, a group of Republican senators led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) held a closed-door meeting to discuss a strategy for messaging on abortion restrictions during the 2024 election cycle.

The consensus drawn from that meeting highlighted the need to move away from simple terms of being for or against abortion and toward more specific policy proposals.

Rose said that emphasizing the science of fetal development will be crucial.

“Human life begins at fertilization,” Rose said. “Abortion is a murderous act of violence. Embracing the truth with courage is the first step toward the next political victory.”"
Sep 21 2023,Abortions resume in Wisconsin after 15 months of legal uncertainty,NPR (Online News),left,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/09/21/1200610927/abortions-resume-in-wisconsin-after-15-months-of-legal-uncertainty,"Abortions resume in Wisconsin after 15 months of legal uncertainty

After more than a year, Planned Parenthood is once again providing abortions in Wisconsin.

Starting Monday, the group began offering abortion appointments at two locations — the Water Street Health Center in Milwaukee and the Madison East Health Center.

The decision follows a nearly 15-month period during which virtually no legal abortions were available in Wisconsin.

Providers across Wisconsin stopped offering the procedure in June of 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. That's largely because of a long-dormant state law, which was widely interpreted as banning abortions unless they're done to save a pregnant person's life.

But in an ongoing court case, Dane County Circuit Court Judge Diane Schlipper ruled that the 19th century law actually bans feticide — when someone attacks a pregnant person and destroys the fetus — rather than abortions performed with a patient's consent.

Planned Parenthood cites this as a basis to return to performing abortions.

""In consultation with attorneys, physicians, partners and stakeholders, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is confident in our decision to resume abortion care in Wisconsin,"" Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin CEO Tanya Atkinson said in a video announcement last week.

In an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio on Monday, Atkinson said people began requesting abortion appointments immediately after Planned Parenthood announced the change.

""All of our appointment slots were full within 24 hours,"" Atkinson said. ""So it's clear that the need is great.""

Meanwhile, at Planned Parenthood's Water Street clinic in Milwaukee, nearly 50 anti-abortion protestors had gathered by Monday morning to pray and sing. Among them was Sarah Storms, who cited her Christian faith.

""We view innocent pre-born children as our neighbor, and we have a duty to stand up and speak on their behalf as they're being led away to death,"" Storms said. ""We have a special inspiration today because abortion laws against abortion in our state are being disregarded and not enforced by the authorities that be.""

The ruling in Dane County this summer was the latest twist in an ongoing dispute over the legality of abortions under Wisconsin's 1849 law.

Wisconsin's Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued days after Roe's overturn in an attempt to block prosecutions of abortions under the law. This summer, Dane County's Schlipper allowed the case to proceed when she dismissed a motion from Sheboygan County District Attorney Joel Urmanksi, which asked for Kaul's lawsuit to be thrown out.

In her July ruling, Judge Schlipper cited a 1994 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision.

""According to State v. Black, ... this pre-Roe statute says nothing about abortion—there is no such thing as an '1849 Abortion Ban' in Wisconsin,"" Schlipper wrote. ""A physician who performs a consensual medical abortion commits a crime only 'after the fetus or unborn child reaches viability.""'

The Dane County case is ongoing and is likely to be appealed to Wisconsin's Supreme Court, where liberals now hold a 4-3 majority.

Newly-elected state supreme court Justice Janet Protasiewicz was outspoken about her support for abortion rights during her 2023 campaign, prompting criticism from Republicans who accused her of pre-judging potential cases.

Last week, Wisconsin's state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican from Rochester, blasted the decision of Planned Parenthood to resume abortions while Kaul's lawsuit is still pending.

""We're still working our way through the legislative and the process inside the courts,"" Vos told reporters. ""So it's very presumptive, and it's one of the things that worries me about the independence of our judiciary.""

Prior to Roe's overturn, elective abortions were available in only three cities in Wisconsin — Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

The Madison and Milwaukee Planned Parenthood clinics that are resuming abortions are both located in counties where Democratic district attorneys have pledged not to prosecute abortion providers under the 1849 law. But in Sheboygan County, Urmanski, a Republican, has said he would enforce the law.

Planned Parenthood is looking into resuming abortion services at its Sheboygan clinic, Atkinson said Friday.

""We continue to work on logistics in order to in order to do that,"" Atkinson said. ""We want to make sure that we are able to offer a meaningful schedule for folks who need access.""

Cynthia Lin is board president of the Women's Medical Fund, a Wisconsin nonprofit that provides financial assistance to people seeking abortions. She applauded Planned Parenthood's decision to resume abortions in Wisconsin, and said the Fund will continue working with people seeking abortions, whether they're traveling within Wisconsin or outside its borders.

""We know that people will continue needing abortions, and will continue getting them,"" Lin said. ""Some will also continue traveling out-of-state as they did, because of relatively more cumbersome restrictions in Wisconsin compared to some of our neighboring states."""
Nov 08 2023,Ohio voters pass Issue 1 constitutional amendment to protect abortion and reproductive rights ⋆ Michigan Advance,Michigan Advance,center,https://michiganadvance.com/2023/11/08/ohio-voters-pass-issue-1-constitutional-amendment-to-protect-abortion-and-reproductive-rights,"Ohio voters passed the Issue 1 constitutional amendment to protect abortion and reproductive rights Tuesday. The Associated Press called the election over Issue 1 shortly after 9 p.m.

With more than 99% of precincts reporting early Wednesday, the amendment was passing with 56.35% of the vote, or 2.14 million voters out of more than 3.8 million who had cast ballots in the race. That result will remain unofficial until provisional ballots are counted and official results are certified.

“Today, Ohioans made it clear, abortion is a winning issue, and together we can do anything,” said Lauren Blauvelt, co-chair of the Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights and executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.

The amendment, brought by Ohio Physicians for Reproductive Rights, Ohioans for Reproductive Freedom and other reproductive rights advocacy groups, will enshrine abortion, contraception, fertility treatment, miscarriage care, and continuing one’s own pregnancy into the Ohio Constitution.

The measure is similar to the constitutional amendment Michigan voters passed in 2022, Proposal 3.

Nancy Kramer, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights and one of the individuals who led the constitutional amendment effort, said the amendment was a “citizen-led” effort full of “diverse and dynamic” people.

“We have marshaled the resources, the enthusiasm and now the votes of millions of Ohioans,” Kramer said at a Tuesday night watch party for Issue 1 supporters and the media.

The Issue 1 effort sought to stem attempts by both state and federal officials to regulate abortion through the use of bans and/or limits, and continue a burgeoning trend in the country that saw usual Republican strongholds like Kentucky and Kansas pass abortion rights measures by overwhelming numbers, along with Michigan, California and Vermont. Montana voters rejected an initiative that would have allowed criminal charges for providers who failed to take “reasonable actions” to save a fetus, even after an abortion.

In Ohio, a six-week ban with no exceptions for rape or incest was passed in 2019 and signed by Gov. Mike DeWine. Then it was tied up in court until the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned the national legalization of abortion in Roe v. Wade. That day, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost moved to get the six-week ban released from its court entanglement, which allowed the ban to be implemented for 82 days in 2022.

Abortion rights groups tried to get the Ohio Supreme Court to intervene, but after weeks of inaction, the groups moved the case to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, where a judge issued a preliminary injunction in the fall of 2022, pausing the ban indefinitely.

The case still has not been resolved, even causing the state to appeal the injunction to the Ohio Supreme Court. The state’s highest court heard arguments about the injunction, but still has not ruled on the appeal. The amendment’s passage will likely provoke further legal action and requests for judgment, though advocates have not yet declared what their next steps will be.

On the amendment’s passage, the organizing director for the ACLU of Ohio, Elizabeth Chasteen Day, said the conservative moniker has been assigned to Ohio, but that didn’t deter voters for Issue 1.

“They like to say we’re conservative, they like to count us out, but what we know about Ohioans is that you can’t count us out,” Chasteen Day said.

Hundreds of organizers, campaigners and canvassers attended the election night watch party for Issue 1, gathering to see the election results on TV monitors and join with fellow supporters.

Melinda Dobson attended Tuesday’s election night watch party for the Issue 1 supporters. Her husband works for the ACLU, but she took time to canvass today in Cincinnati before coming up for the event.

She said the issue comes down to the next generation, who she wants to set up for the future.

“I have a daughter and I really want to make sure that she has more rights than we do, not less rights,” Dobson said.

President Joe Biden issued a statement following Issue 1’s passage: “Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide.”

The road to Election Day

The summer started off with high hopes for the amendment after signature collectors submitted more than 400 boxes of signatures to the Ohio Secretary of State. Nearly 500,000 of the signatures were verified, indicating a large base of support for the amendment before campaigning had even begun.

The Ohio Ballot Board approved the language of the amendment, but changed the summary language that voters would see on their ballots, to the chagrin of abortion rights advocates, who said changing words like the medically-accepted “fetus” to “unborn child,” among other changes, slanted the summary in a way that misrepresented the amendment itself.

The Ohio Supreme Court disagreed for the most part after hearing a challenge to the changes. The court ruled that most of the changes could stay, with the exception of wording that assigned authority to the “citizens of the state of Ohio,” which the state supreme court ordered the ballot board to return to the previous language of “the state of Ohio.”

The amendment avoided another potential hurdle after state Republicans, including Ohio’s Secretary of State Frank LaRose, put their support behind a previous Issue 1 this August, which would have changed the Ohio Constitution by raising the threshold to pass any amendment from 50% to 60%. Ohio voters rejected that amendment with 57% against.

Polling since the amendment was introduced showed majority support for the measure, matching or exceeding public opinion polls from previous years.

Early voting showed the same support for the measure as polls seemed to, with Democratic areas of the state overperforming not only in favor of the abortion amendment, but also for Issue 2, the initiated statute to legalize marijuana.

The opposition reaction

The organization Protect Women Ohio led the effort to defeat Issue 1 while Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and Leonard Leo-connected Concord Fund put more than $15 million each into the effort. The “no” campaign was marked by disinformation, with ads that claimed the amendment would undermine parental consent for minors seeking abortions or gender affirming care. Legal experts repeatedly shot down these assertions.

Shortly after the AP called the race, former Ohio Right to Life official Lizzie Marbach released a statement criticizing organizations for not addressing the issue “head on.” Ohio Right To Life parted ways with Marbach earlier this year over her social media use and tone.

Marbach insisted anti-abortion groups’ “cowardice during this pivotal moment should not be forgotten moving forward.” She added that the fight will now turn to establishing equal protection for unborn fetuses through The 14th Amendment.

Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephens promised to continue fighting as well.

“As a 100% pro-life conservative, I remain steadfastly committed to protecting life, and that commitment is unwavering,” he wrote in a statement. “The legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life. This is not the end of the conversation.”

Later, Center for Christian Virtue President Aaron Baer spoke to reporters on behalf of Protect Women Ohio. He insisted that “Issue 1 does not represent Ohio values,” and warned the parade of horribles from their campaign ads is right around the corner.

“We stand ready during this unthinkable time to advocate for women and the unborn — just as we have always done,” he said. “We persevered for 50 years to overturn Roe v Wade. Ours is a movement that has always endured and always will. Tomorrow, the work starts again.”

Nov 07 2023,Ohio votes for abortion rights and recreational marijuana. Dems doing well everywhere except Mississippi.,Boing Boing,left,https://boingboing.net/2023/11/07/ohio-votes-to-add-abortion-rights-to-state-constitution-legalizes-recreational-marijuana.html,"Voters in Ohio today voted to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and to legalize recreational marijuana. With about 80% of the votes counted, both measures were tallied at about 56% to 44% for and against. The pro-abortion vote came despite furious efforts by conservatives to block the vote and then to sabotage the plebiscite by making the question confusingly-worded; the former effort failed and the latter prevailed, but voters in the Buckeye State were not fooled.

The win for women's rights followed similar referendum outcomes in deep-red Kansas and Kentucky, where the Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, was re-elected in the governor's race Tuesday. CNN:

Ohioans approved a ballot measure to protect abortion rights in the state constitution, CNN projects, in the latest win for abortion advocates since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The vote is yet another sign abortion access is a key issue for voters across party lines ahead of the 2024 presidential election. In another significant vote, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear is projected to be reelected in Kentucky. He will defeat GOP Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who had the backing of former President Donald Trump and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.

The GOP did score a win, though, in Tate Reeves, the Republican governor of Mississippi, who was also re-elected. That his Democratic opponent fancied himself a chance in Mississippi, however, was discomfiting enough for GOP leaders plainly upset by the Ohio result.

Asked by CNN if he's concerned his party is on the wrong side of public opinion on the issue, House Speaker Mike Johnson — who has made his anti-abortion views central to his political identity — said: ""I'm not going to comment on that.""

The other big question of the night is control of Virginia's legislature, where, as of 10:30 p.m. eastern time, Democrats appear to be doing well, have already held the Senate, and are on the cusp of taking the House. Semafor's Dave Weigel writes that progressive primary wins may move this potential majority ""a bit to the left,"" too."
Nov 07 2023,"Ohio votes to protect abortion rights in state constitution, blocking GOP's 6-week ban",Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/11/7/2204309/-Ohio-votes-to-protect-abortion-rights-in-state-constitution-blocking-GOP-s-6-week-ban,"Ohio enshrined the right to an abortion into the state constitution on Tuesday night, with voters giving their approval to a citizen-backed initiative known as Issue 1. The ""yes"" side was ahead 59-41 with approximately 36% of the vote counted when the Associated Press called the race.

The vote ensures that the state's six-week abortion ban, which Republicans passed in 2019 but was put on hold by a court earlier this year, can never be revived. Instead, Issue 1 reestablishes a framework similar to the one that existed under Roe v. Wade. Under that approach, the state would be restrained from passing laws that curtail the right to an abortion up until fetal viability, which occurs at around 22 to 24 weeks into pregnancy. Later abortions would also be permitted, according to the amendment's text, ""if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient's treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient's life or health.""

The amendment further protects several other reproductive freedoms, including the right to contraception and fertility treatments, both of which have also been under attack from conservatives. Ohio Republicans did everything they could to undermine Issue 1 as well, an effort that included calling a special election in August for an amendment that would have made future ballot measures much harder to pass. Voters, however, rejected that amendment (also known as Issue 1) by a 57-43 margin, presaging Tuesday night's result.

The win is the latest in an unbroken string of victories for reproductive rights dating back to August of last year, when voters in deep-red Kansas rejected an amendment that would have rolled back the state's guarantee of abortion access. Advocates are now hoping for similar successes elsewhere, with efforts to qualify constitutional amendments underway in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, and South Dakota."

Aug 08 2023,Ohio Special Election Indirectly Affects Abortion,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/ohio-abortion-issue-1/2023/08/08/id/1130049,"The abortion issue takes center stage in Ohio on Tuesday when voters decide whether to make it more difficult to pass amendments to the state constitution.

Pro-life supporters want to pass Issue 1, which would make it harder to pass future constitutional amendments. Abortion advocates want to vote down the measure.

The Issue 1 debate has focused on how it would affect a November ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In the spring, when abortion rights supporters were compiling signatures for their constitutional amendment, Ohio's Republican-controlled legislature voted to put Issue 1 on the ballot in a special election in August.

Issue 1, which needs a simple majority to pass, would require that future state amendments receive at least 60% approval to be added to Ohio's constitution.

It also would require citizens who want to put an amendment on the ballot to get signatures from each of the state's 88 counties, instead of the present 44, and eliminate a 10-day period in which signatures deemed faulty can be replaced, the Journal reported.

If Issue 1 is voted down, the proposed November ballot amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution would need only a simple majority to pass.

Issue 1 backers say the measure is needed to keep out-of-state special interest groups from bypassing the legislature on a range of issues. Opponents say the intent of Issue 1 is to prevent the abortion-rights amendment from passing.

The Journal reported that as of Friday, 578,490 Ohioans had voted early in-person or by mail despite lines with up to an hour wait; 150,000 people voted early in an August primary last year.

Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis told the Journal that he believes supporters of Issue 1 will wait until Tuesday to vote in person.

""Our strategy was to surge up to election day because that's when all our people vote,"" he said.

Last month, Secretary of State Frank LaRose approved the abortion measure for the November ballot.

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, a 2019 law banning abortion at six-weeks took effect in Ohio.

However, a state judge issued an injunction in September blocking that law while litigation proceeds. Meanwhile, abortion is legal in Ohio up to 22 weeks of pregnancy.

Voters have favored abortion rights in referendums in half a dozen states since the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision.

Those states include Kansas and Kentucky, which, as did Ohio, voted for Donald Trump in the past two presidential elections.

Ohio's abortion measure in November states that every individual ""has a right to make and carry out one's own reproductive decisions,"" the Journal reported.

It also says that abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability, except to protect a patient's life or health."

Aug 09 2023,Ohio Vote Shows Power of Abortion on the Ballot,U.S. News & World Report,left,https://usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2023-08-09/ohio-vote-shows-power-of-abortion-on-the-ballot,"Republican lawmakers in Ohio pulled out their biggest weapon to ban abortion and affirm their dominance in the state, forcing a referendum Tuesday to make it harder for Buckeye Staters to amend their own constitution.



They lost overwhelmingly, and the result has implications not only for abortion rights nationwide but for a state that has been turning reliably red in the past decade.

By a landslide margin of 57% to 43%, Ohio voters rejected a ballot measure that would have required a 60% majority to amend the state constitution by ballot initiative. The measure imposed other higher bars as well, including a requirement for minimum signatures from every county to get something on the ballot as opposed to the current standard of half of the state's 88 counties.

Tuesday's referendum – put on the ballot by a state legislature that just last year had voted to ban almost all special elections in August – means a separate referendum enshrining the right to abortion, contraception and fertility treatments will appear on the ballot this fall. With a recent USA Today/Suffolk University poll showing strong majority support for the reproductive rights measure, it appears poised to pass.

As a one-off, Tuesday night's vote was a victory for abortion rights activists and those who believed the higher threshold would have taken power away from voters and put it in the hands of a GOP-controlled legislature.



""Today, Ohio voters rejected an effort by Republican lawmakers and special interests to change the state’s constitutional amendment process,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement after the results. ""This measure was a blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions. Ohioans spoke loud and clear, and tonight democracy won.""

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, an anti-abortion group, called Tuesday's vote ""a sad day for Ohio and a warning for pro-life states across the nation."" The track record of anti-abortion activists since last summer's Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization indicates they are indeed losing the ballot initiative battle.

Citizens in both red and blue states are using ballot measures to ensure abortion rights since the Dobbs ruling.

In three states – California, Vermont and Michigan – voters last year approved ballot measures ensuring the right to an abortion. In Kansas and Kentucky, citizens defeated ballot measures that would have said explicitly that abortion rights are not guaranteed in the state constitution. And in Montana, voters rejected the ""Born-Alive Infant Protection Act,"" which would have imposed fines and prison time for health care providers who did not try to save infants born after induced labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion or another method.

In Arizona, a coalition of groups is pushing an abortion rights referendum to appear on the ballot in the fall of 2024. Current state law allows abortion through 15 weeks of pregnancy, a standard that went into effect last September.



Polls show that Arizona voters overwhelmingly back abortion rights, at least in some circumstances. But should the referendum make it on the ballot, it could motivate Democrats and boost Biden's chances in a state he won by a razor-thin margin in 2020.

A survey released this week by Data for Progress, a liberal group, found that after being told about the abortion referendum, Democrats were more slightly likely (by 2 percentage points) to vote, and Republicans said they were less likely (by 7 percentage points) to show up to vote. Even a small divergence in turnout could be pivotal in battleground Arizona.

Tuesday's vote also gave Ohio Democrats nascent hope for their chances in a red state once considered the central battleground in presidential elections.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ohio's only statewide elected Democrat, is up for reelection next year and is considered vulnerable.

Frank LaRose, Ohio's Republican secretary of state and a GOP contender for Brown's seat, indicated in a statement that he will not relent on the battle to ban abortion, calling Tuesday's loss ""only one battle in a long war.

""I’ve said for months now that there’s an assault coming on our constitution, and that hasn’t changed. I’m just getting started in the fight to protect Ohio’s values,” LaRose said.

But Tuesday night's results suggest an opening and a strategy for Brown and other Democrats.

""Sherrod Brown was given a gift by Ohio Republicans. He now has a good idea who to target with pro-choice messaging,"" Michael McDonald, an elections expert and professor at the University of Florida, tweeted Tuesday night.

Democrats have historically prevailed in Ohio's cities, but in recent elections that advantage has not been enough to overcome GOP dominance in rural and suburban counties. In 2020, Biden won the counties of every large city but lost in every other Buckeye State county except Athens County, where a large college community has tinted the county blue.

In 2022, Democratic candidate for Senate Tim Ryan had almost the same record in his unsuccessful quest to defeat his GOP opponent, Sen. J.D Vance, adding only Lorain County, west of Cleveland, to his county win column.



In the vote on the referendum to raise the bar for citizen ballot questions, the ""no"" camp made substantial inroads on the ""collar counties"" around Ohio's cities.

All of the counties surrounding Cleveland and Akron voted no on the measure. So did Delaware County, bordering Columbus on the north, and two counties bordering Toledo's home county of Lucas.

Very encouraging for Democrats was the showing in Clark County and Greene County, to the east of Dayton, where the ""no"" camp won narrowly (by a single vote in Clark, as of Wednesday morning). Vance won Clark by more than 22 percentage points in 2022 and won Greene by nearly 20 percentage points. Trump beat Biden by similar margins in those counties in 2020.

Those shifts don't put Ohio back in solid battleground territory next year. But they may suggest an opportunity Democrats are seeing in many suburban areas. It was the ""collar counties"" around Atlanta, for example, where steady Democratic gains allowed Biden to win the state in 2020, the first time a Democratic presidential candidate has won the state since 1992."

Ron DeSantis for his abortion stance on Monday, suggesting in an interview that Florida's six-week restriction was ""too harsh.""

Trump made the statement in a wide-ranging interview with The Messenger published on Monday. Trump refused to elaborate on his own stance regarding abortion, however, instead claiming to have heard that pro-life voters opposed DeSantis' bill.

""He has to do what he has to do,"" Trump said when asked about Florida's abortion rules. ""If you look at what DeSantis did, a lot of people don't even know if he knew what he was doing. But he signed six weeks, and many people within the pro-life movement feel that that was too harsh.""

When asked about whether he would support restrictions on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, Trump replied, ""I'm looking at all options.""

Trump also confirmed in the interview that he supported exceptions in abortion legislation for ""the life of the mother, raping and incest.""

""Just as Ronald Reagan was a believer in the exceptions, but I'm a believer in the exceptions,"" he added.

DeSantis' abortion bill, signed in mid-April, bans most abortions beyond six weeks but includes exceptions for rape and incest. Existing state exceptions for the life of the mother also remain in place.

Rather than get specific on his abortion stance, Trump went on to tout his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, saying he was the only president who could have done so.

""For 50 years, they've been trying to get rid of Roe v Wade. I was able to do it. Nobody else could have done that but me. And I was able to do it [by nominating] three excellent judges on the Justices of the Supreme Court. And I was able to do that,"" he said.

""I'm looking at all alternatives. I'm looking at many alternatives,"" Trump added when asked if six weeks was too harsh. ""But I was able to get us to the table by terminating Roe v. Wade. That's the most important thing that's ever happened for the pro-life movement.""

It is unclear who Trump was referring to when he stated that ""many people within the pro-life movement"" opposed DeSantis' bill.

Students For Life President Kristan Hawkins thanked the Florida governor after he signed the legislation in April, saying, ""Florida will no longer be the fifth highest abortion state in the nation thanks to the Heartbeat Protection Act. Thank you @GovRonDeSantis for having the courage to do the right thing. You are setting the standard for GOP and they should follow your lead.""

Conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom also celebrated the signing.

""By enacting the Heartbeat Protection Act, Florida is continuing its work to protect the health of pregnant mothers, the dignity of the unborn, and the integrity of the medical profession. We commend @GovRonDeSantis for taking a stand to preserve life,"" the organization said.

Pro-life activist Abby Johnson claimed DeSantis signing the bill is ""one step closer to protecting children from the moment of conception just like they deserve.""

Sep 18 2023,Wisconsin resumes offering abortions following 1-year hiatus,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-resumes-offering-abortions-following-1-year-hiatus,"Planned Parenthood resumed offering abortion services in Wisconsin on Monday after halting them for more than a year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

Providers across the state stopped offering abortions following the June 2022 decision, fearing enforcement of an 1849 state law that appears to ban the procedure but had previously been nullified by the 1973 Roe ruling. A judge ruled last month that the 144-year-old law doesn't apply to medical abortions.

In light of the ruling, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin began offering abortions at clinics in Madison and Milwaukee again on Monday. The group did not say how many abortions it expected to perform but said appointments at its Milwaukee clinic on Monday were completely filled within 24 hours of announcing that services would resume.

Without access to abortion care in Wisconsin for the past 15 months, many patients have sought assistance in neighboring Illinois, where abortions have remained widely available. According to Planned Parenthood of Illinois, its clinics have seen a seven-fold increase in patients from Wisconsin since the Supreme Court overturned Roe.

The lawsuit challenging Wisconsin's 1849 law was brought by the state's Democratic attorney general and is expected to end up in front of the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which flipped to liberal control last month.

Democrats, including Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, praised the resumption of abortion services. Meanwhile, anti-abortion rights groups in the state condemned the move and promised to continue fighting in court for the procedure to be outlawed."
Oct 17 2023,"Lawsuit filed to stop city from spending $500,000 on abortion travel",Fox 29 KABB,center,https://foxsanantonio.com/newsletter-daily/a-lawsuit-looks-to-stop-500000-from-being-used-for-a-reproductive-justice-fund-but-the-city-says-the-money-has-not-yet-been-allocated,"SAN ANTONIO - It's a story we've followed for months and Tuesday night the battle over how to handle $500,000 continued.

Earlier in 2023, the city approved part of the CPS Energy surplus to be put into a .

Now, more than three dozen people and groups are suing the city to put a stop to it.

City leaders though said the money has yet to be allocated as a has hit their desks.

“Nobody is surprised,” District Eight Councilman Manny Pelaez said.

“This was very predictable,” District 10 Councilman Marc Whyte said.

The from a nearly $20,000,000 CPS Energy surplus for a Reproductive Justice Fund. The lawsuit claims the fund will provide grants to organizations that would pay the travel costs for pregnant women to have abortions.

City Attorney Andy Segovia is fighting back against the lawsuit's claims and said in part no final decision had been made on how the money would be used.

Councilmen Manny Pelaez and Marc Whyte spoke with us Tuesday afternoon on the developments.

“I don't think, based on my 20 something years of practicing law, that this lawsuit is going to go anywhere,” Pelaez said.

“I would challenge my colleagues [to] put aside your personal beliefs on the issue of abortion. This is about city government, and what our role is,” Whyte said.

Tuesday afternoon we also sat down with Plaintiffs San Antonio Family Association and Texas Right to Life who explain why they filed now even though the money hasn't been allocated.

“We're going to stand up for women and their unborn children and the taxpayers on behalf of them and families. We want to protect taxpayers and their money,” San Antonio Family Association Board Member Patrick Von Dohlen said.

“San Antonio has kind of crossed the line here. As a statewide organization, we want to send a message that no other city should go this route,” Texas Right to Life President Dr. John Seago said.

Listed in the lawsuit are five groups the plaintiffs said lobbied for the money to be used in the fund. They include Avow, The Buckle Bunnies Fund, Sueños Sin Fronteras, The Lilith Fund for Reproductive Equite and Jane's Due Process.

We spoke with the Executive Director of Jane’s Due Process Jaymie Cobb about the lawsuit.

“We plan to watch it and see what happens. It is expensive to go to a gynecologist. It is expensive to go to a clinic. It is expensive to buy diapers. And this is why we're here to help them,” Cobb said.

This lawsuit will be funded with your taxpayer dollars.

Segovia said the City Council plans to have an open work session to discuss the use of the funds that will be managed by Metro Health. He adds the money will be distributed in line with state and federal laws.

The following is Segovia’s entire statement:

It is unfortunate taxpayer funds will be spent on defending against this lawsuit based on misinformation and false allegations. The facts are that a decision has not been made on how that money will be used. The City Council will have an open work session to discuss the use of the funds that will be managed by the City’s Metro Health Department. The funds will be distributed in accordance with State and Federal Laws."
Oct 26 2023,All-male panel of local officials makes it illegal to travel outside Texas for an abortion,Law & Crime,center,https://lawandcrime.com/abortion/all-male-panel-of-local-county-officials-makes-it-illegal-to-help-someone-travel-outside-texas-for-an-abortion,"An all-male panel of commissioners in Lubbock County, Texas, voted Monday to outlaw transporting or even helping to fund transporting people out of state if the purpose of the trip is to get an abortion. The panel said the ordinance was part of its plan to make Lubbock a “sanctuary county for the unborn.”

Commissioners Terence Kovar, Jason Corley, and Jordan Rackler voted in favor of the ordinance, and the body’s two other members — County Judge Curtis Parrish and Commissioner Gilbert Flores — abstained. The commissioners declared that “abortion is a murderous act of violence,” and lamented that “Texas men and women are being hurt and traumatized by abortion across our Texas-New Mexico border and sent back to Texas for our county and our cities to deal with the aftermath in our homes, schools, churches, and hospitals.”

To protect said men and women from these ostensible hardships, the committee made it illegal transport any individual to have an abortion “regardless of where the elective abortion will occur.”

In other words, it is illegal to take someone to any location including out of the state to have an abortion. It is now also illegal to offer, give, or lend money to anyone who will then use the money to travel somewhere to get an abortion.

The ordinance does not impose criminal penalties, but allows for private lawsuits against violators for a number of compensatory damages as well as a $10,000 fine for each violation.

Lubbock County, named for a Confederate colonel, has a population of over 310,000. It is now the largest county in Texas to pass such a law, joining the rural counties of Goliad, Mitchell and Cochran, which have already passed similar legislation.

Lubbock’s ordinance raises significant questions of constitutionality with respect to what is known as the “dormant commerce clause.”

The dormant commerce clause is not an actual clause in the Constitution but a legal principle that can best be understood as a turf battle between individual states and the federal government. Under Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, Congress has the sole power “to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among states, and with the Indian tribes.” When Congress has not passed specific laws governing a particular aspect of interstate trade, its power to do so lies “dormant.” This unused but available authority belongs to Congress alone — and not to individual states.

States, therefore, are not permitted to use their laws to restrict the flow of commerce from state to state without the explicit approval of Congress. Supreme Court precedents reaching back decades have invalidated state regulations that did things to restrict travel, transportation, and commerce between states.

For example, a New York law that attempted to protect its dairy industry during the 1930s by prohibiting the purchase of milk from outside the state was found to violate the dormant commerce clause because it inhibited interstate activity. In the late 1970s, a New Jersey law that established different standards for waste brought from outside the state from that which originated in New Jersey was struck down for the same reason. Other examples of laws that violated the dormant commerce clause included an Illinois law that required an unusual type of mudflaps to be used on trucks and a Connecticut statute that required out-of-state shippers to put particular labels on beer.

Typically, dormant commerce clause analysis requires courts to determine whether a particular state regulation is primarily aimed at public health and safety — which falls squarely within state control — or is primarily discriminatory against interstate interests. However, most dormant commerce clause challenges involve regulations that do not explicitly restrict travel or transportation.

Although Lubbock’s ordinance would arguably fall into the sphere of “public health and safety,” its direct restriction on travel makes its legality highly suspect. Of course, the conservative Supreme Court has not only proven itself to be hostile to abortion in many contexts, it also ruled recently that the dormant commerce clause did not invalidate California’s tight restrictions on pork production despite their serious economic impact on an interstate industry.

Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas spokesperson Autumn Keiser released a statement Tuesday denouncing Lubbock’s ordinance as an “unnecessary, confusing, and fear-inducing barrier to essential healthcare.”

The organizations that are the forefront of the movement include abortion behemoth Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The groups filed a petition with Nevada’s Secretary of State on Thursday to get a question on the ballot for the proposed amendment.

Now, the pro-abortion supporters will have to garner 103,000 signatures from registered voters by June 26 to get the proposed amendment on the ballot.

“The fallout of the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade has shown us that we have already suffered one year too long without the guaranteed right to reproductive freedom, and we simply cannot afford to stand by and allow any further encroachment on the fundamental right of Nevadans to determine their own reproductive lives and care,” Lindsey Harmon, executive director for Planned Parenthood Votes Nevada, said in a statement.

Right now, Nevada allows abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy. This is extreme compared to many states that enacted protections for the unborn after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade. Many states protected life by passing laws that banned abortion after fetal heartbeat detection.

“The right of an individual to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, burdened or infringed upon unless justified by a compelling State interest that is achieved by the least restrictive means available,” the new proposal reportedly states.

Pro-abortion supporters are currently implementing a similar approach in other battleground states, like Ohio and Arizona. Ohio’s proposed amendment would enshrine abortion access and access to transgender care in the state’s constitution.

“This extreme anti-life, anti-parent amendment from the ACLU provides no protections for the preborn through all nine months of pregnancy and attacks a parent's right even to know if their child is seeking an abortion or gender surgery,” Peter Range, the chief executive of Ohio Right to Life, said in a statement."

Sep 14 2023,Planned Parenthood’s risky plan to bring abortions back to Wisconsin,Vox,left,https://vox.com/2023/9/14/23873697/abortion-wisconsin-planned-parenthood-supreme-court,"Planned Parenthood made a somewhat surprising announcement on Thursday: It will resume providing abortion care in Wisconsin, even though litigation asking whether abortion is legal in that state has not yet concluded — and no court has yet issued an injunction prohibiting state officials from prosecuting doctors who perform abortions.

Abortions have not been freely available in Wisconsin since the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade more than a year ago — though last July, a Wisconsin state judge did rule that a 174-old state law, which appears to ban abortions throughout the state, does not in fact do so. But that order, in a case called Kaul v. Urmanski, concerned a prosecutor’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit. The Kaul lawsuit has not yet reached the stage where the judge hands down a legally binding order prohibiting this prosecutor from actually targeting abortion providers.

Significantly, the 1849 statute at issue in the Kaul case makes it a felony for “any person, other than the mother” who “destroys the life of an unborn child.” So, the law cannot plausibly be read to target patients who receive abortions. Planned Parenthood says that it intends to start offering abortions in Wisconsin on Monday, and patients who take advantage of these services should be immune from prosecution under the 1849 law.

Wisconsin abortion providers, however — at least prior to Planned Parenthood’s decision — quite reasonably feared that they could be prosecuted under the 1849 law, although there are strong arguments that this very old ban on abortions was limited or repealed by a later statute.

Planned Parenthood’s announcement also comes about six weeks after Democrats effectively gained control of the state supreme court, which was controlled by conservative Republicans for many years. Justice Janet Protasiewicz, the newest member of that court, campaigned on support for abortion rights, as well as on opposition to a gerrymander that’s given Republicans virtually unbreakable control over the state legislature. And she won her race in a landslide.

Additionally, several Republican lawmakers appear to be backing away from a threat to impeach Protasiewicz — an impeachment that would most likely violate the federal Constitution — in order to prevent her from striking down the state’s gerrymandered maps.

So, while abortion providers cannot yet be certain that it is legal to perform an abortion in Wisconsin, the combination of the July court order, the new state supreme court majority, and the diminished threat of impeachment all suggest that it is very likely that abortion will soon be declared legal in Wisconsin.

So is abortion illegal in Wisconsin or not?

Read in isolation, the 1849 law appears to ban abortion. That statute provides that “any person, other than the mother, who intentionally destroys the life of an unborn child may be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than 3 years or both.” A separate provision applies a stricter 15-year penalty to anyone who “intentionally destroys the life of an unborn quick child” (“quick” refers to the point when a fetus begins to move inside the uterus).

In 1985, however, the Wisconsin legislature enacted a different law, which only criminalizes abortion after a fetus is “viable,” meaning that a physician has determined that “there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the fetus outside the womb” — something that occurs roughly 23 to 25 weeks into a pregnancy. The 1985 law arguably displaces the 1849 law, replacing a total ban on abortion with a new regime permitting abortion up to the point of fetal viability.

Nevertheless, the 1849 law has never been explicitly repealed.

In State v. Black (1994), the state supreme court seemed to resolve this tension between the older and newer laws by construing the older law to apply only to “feticide,” a violent act performed “presumably without the consent of the mother,” and not to “consensual abortions.”

The facts of the Black case are truly horrific. A husband assaulted his pregnant wife five days before her expected delivery date, killing their soon-to-be-born child in the process. The husband then argued that, if he could be prosecuted under the 1849 law, that law could also “be used against a woman or her physician (in the context of performing an abortion).”

In rejecting this argument, the court read the 1849 law narrowly. This older law, the state supreme court ruled, “is not an abortion statute” and it only “proscribes the intentional criminal act of feticide: the intentional destruction of an unborn quick child presumably without the consent of the mother.” Meanwhile, the newer 1985 law governed “consensual abortions.”

Judge Diane Schlipper, a state trial judge, relied heavily on Black in her July order in the Kaul lawsuit, which concluded that the 1849 law “does not prohibit a consensual medical abortion.”

So, while there’s not yet any certainty that Schlipper’s decision will be upheld on appeal — and Schlipper has not yet issued a formal injunction preventing prosecutors from targeting abortion providers — Planned Parenthood is probably not endangering its physicians by resuming abortion care in Wisconsin.

Before Protasiewicz took her seat, there was a very real danger that the state supreme court’s right-wing majority would overrule or ignore Black. But that danger appears to have passed now that Democrats have an effective 4-3 majority on the state supreme court.

Still, Planned Parenthood’s decision to resume abortion care as soon as Monday is quite bold, because it comes before they can be absolutely certain how the Kaul lawsuit will play out."

Jun 20 2023,NY approves protections for providers who send abortion pills to states with strict anti-abortion laws,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/long-island/politics/new-york-legislation-protects-doctors-abortion-pills-out-of-state-dbjg83bq,"ALBANY — The Assembly gave final approval Tuesday to legislation that would provide legal protection for New York physicians and medical professionals who prescribe and send abortion medication to patients in states with strict anti-abortion laws.

The Democrat-dominated Assembly approved the measure, 99-45, largely along party lines. The Senate, also led by Democrats, had approved it in May.

Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who has championed a number of abortion-rights measures, is expected to support the bill though her office didn’t immediately comment.

Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he backed the legislation because current New York law doesn’t “provide protection against out-of-state litigation for the use of telehealth, and therefore puts doctors at risk for providing care to those in states with laws restricting reproductive health care.”

He said the measure, if signed into law, would provide the “strong reproductive health care shield laws.”

“It is our moral obligation to help women across the country with their bodily autonomy by protecting New York doctors from litigation efforts from anti-choice extremists,” Heastie (D-Bronx) said in a statement. “Telehealth is the future of healthcare, and this bill is simply the next step in making sure our doctors are protected.”

The Assembly, announcing the bill’s passage, said medication-abortions account for more than 50% of abortions nationwide now.

The measure would add to a raft of abortion-rights measures New York has adopted since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights.

Among them, a 2022 law protected abortion providers in New York from arrest, extradition and legal proceedings in other states by forbidding state and local courts and law enforcement agencies from cooperating in most scenarios.

Similarly, the law approved by the Assembly on Tuesday would prevent extradition for providing abortion medication to a patient in a state with a strict abortion ban. But it might not protect a doctor, in this scenario, who then traveled to the state and faced charges."
Oct 24 2023,"Georgia’s 6-week abortion ban stays for now, state Supreme Court rules",Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/10/24/georgia-abortion-ban,"Georgia’s six-week abortion ban will remain in place after the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the law is valid — a move that leaves abortion largely inaccessible in the South. Tuesday’s ruling reverses a lower court decision from 2022 that struck down the law on the grounds that it was unconstitutional when the state legislature passed it in 2019. At the time, Roe v. Wade, which barred states from prohibiting abortion before viability, was still the law of the land. Doctors, abortion providers and other advocacy groups argued that the law was not only unenforceable because it was “void ab initio” — void from the start — but that it violates due process, equal protection and other rights inherent in Georgia’s Constitution.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney agreed with the plaintiffs’ argument about the law’s timing. He determined in his 2022 decision that key parts of it “were plainly unconstitutional when drafted, voted upon, and enacted.”

The majority in Georgia’s Supreme Court, however, disagreed.

“The holdings of United States Supreme Court cases interpreting the United States Constitution that have since been overruled cannot establish that a law was unconstitutional when enacted and therefore cannot render a law void ab initio,” Justice Verda M. Colvin wrote for the majority.

The law was among the strictest in the nation when it was signed by Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in 2019. The case will return to the lower court to settle the questions over whether the violates inherent rights in the state Constitution.

While Tuesday’s decision is not the final word on the state law, it was hailed by Kemp and his Republican attorney general, Chris Carr, who said his office will continue to defend the constitutionality of the law, known as the Georgia Life Act.

Carol McDonald, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, said in a statement that its health-care centers in the region will remain open to provide the limited abortion care that is legal.

The current law bans abortion after six weeks, which is the earliest that fetal cardiac electrical activity — distinct from the heartbeat of a fully formed organ — can be detected. The law has few exceptions, which include when the pregnant person’s life is at risk or in cases of rape and incest, with the requirement that a police report is filed.

Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, the lead plaintiff in the case, called the Tuesday decision “devastating.”

“This abortion ban has forced Georgians to travel across state lines at great expense or continue the life-altering consequences of pregnancy and childbirth against their wills,” she said.

The fight over abortion access has only intensified since the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling last year made control over abortion laws a state issue. Abortion is now banned or heavily restricted in 18 states, including Georgia, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit research center that supports abortion rights. Among these, 15 instated total bans, with very limited exceptions. Two others ban abortions at 12 weeks and onward.

SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser framed Tuesday’s ruling as a win for antiabortion advocates, saying in a statement: “When you lead and stand boldly for life, Americans will stand with you.”

But the reality has been different at the ballot box, where voter referendums to preserve or expand access to abortion have been successful as well as galvanizing forces for abortion rights advocates.

“Today’s ruling is not the end of this fight for women’s health care,” Andrea Young, executive director for the ACLU of Georgia, said in a statement. “Be clear, the right to abortion is on the ballot in 2024. Gov. Brian Kemp and the Georgia legislature acted to take away our rights. The Georgia legislature can restore our rights and we must organize to elect a pro-choice legislature.”

Karine Jean-Pierre, a spokeswoman for President Biden, decried the ruling. She said in a Tuesday statement that the administration “won’t stop fighting until the protections of Roe V. Wade are restored in federal law.”"
Aug 25 2023,West Virginia permitted to regulate the sale of abortion pills,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/west-virginia-permitted-regulate-abortion-pills-court,"

A U.S. federal judge ruled late on Thursday that West Virginia can restrict the sale of abortion pills, saying that the state’s near-total abortion ban takes priority over the drug’s approval by the Food and Drug Administration.

U.S. District Court Judge Robert Chambers, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, ruled in the case that the United States Supreme Court “has made it clear that regulating abortion is a matter of health and safety upon which States may appropriately exercise their police power.”

GenBioPro, the only domestic manufacturer of the generic version of the abortion agent mifepristone, argued that the state cannot block the sale of a federally approved medication.

Chambers reasoned, however, that states have “an even stronger interest and history” than the federal government in regulating medical professionals as well as general health and medical licensing.

“While it may not sit well with manufacturers of abortion drugs, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that regulating abortion is a state issue,” West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a press release. “I will always stand strong for the life of the unborn.”

Gov. Jim Justice (R-WV) signed a total abortion ban into law in September 2022 that was passed through the state legislature. The ban includes exceptions for saving the life of the mother, fatal fetal anomalies, and police-documented cases of rape and incest, but abortions performed under these exceptions must occur within eight weeks of pregnancy."

Oct 24 2023,"Ga. Supreme Court upholds abortion law, sends challenge back to lower court",WRDW,center,https://wrdw.com/2023/10/24/state-supreme-court-upholds-georgias-six-week-abortion-ban,"ATLANTA, Ga. - The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a lower court ruling that the state’s restrictive abortion law was invalid, leaving limited access to abortions unchanged for now.

Tuesday’s ruling does not change abortion access in Georgia and may not be the last word on the state’s ban.

The high court ruling sent the case back to that court to consider the merits of the other challenges brought by the law’s opponents.

The ruling in effect upholds Georgia’s LIFE Act, which is also known as the “heartbeat bill.” It prohibits abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually at around a pregnancy’s six-week mark.

The state Supreme Court’s ruling focused on whether the legislation is viable since it was passed in 2019 when Roe v. Wade was still in effect and guaranteed a federal right to abortion.

READ THE RULING:

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney said last November that the ban was “unequivocally unconstitutional” because it was enacted in 2019, when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions well past six weeks.

The state Supreme Court had previously allowed enforcement of the ban to resume while it considered an appeal of the lower court decision. The lower court judge has also not ruled on the merits of other arguments in a lawsuit challenging the ban.

McBurney had said the law was void from the start, and therefore, the measure did not become law when it was enacted and could not become law even after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year.

State officials challenging that decision noted the Supreme Court’s finding that Roe v. Wade was an incorrect interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. Because the Constitution remained the same, Georgia’s ban was valid when it was enacted, they argued.

THE ‘HEARTBEAT’ LAW:

Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many women know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable.

Georgia’s law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but had been blocked from taking effect until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years. The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed Georgia to begin enforcing its abortion law just over three weeks after the high court’s decision in June 2022.

A legal consideration known as “void ab initio” dictates lawmakers can’t pass an unconstitutional law, knowingly or unknowingly, even if it later becomes constitutional. It’s the consideration Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney used to put a hold on the ban almost a year ago. The state Supreme Court reinstated the ban while the case worked its way through the legal system.

On Tuesday, the Georgia Supreme Court said, “Today’s majority opinion further explains that Georgia courts must follow the U.S. Supreme Court’s most recent pronouncement on the meaning of the U.S. Constitution when determining whether a statutory law violates that Constitution.”

“We are forever thankful for the political will shown by Georgia’s pro-life elected officials including Governor Brian Kemp, Senator Ed Setzler, Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson, and Senator Renee Unterman (ret.) who all fought for the LIFE Act’s passage in 2019,” stated Claire Bartlett, executive director of the Georgia Life Alliance.

U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., had this reaction:

“The state of Georgia’s six-week abortion ban — one of the most extreme in the nation — strips women of autonomy in the most personal health decisions. More than half of Georgia counties have no OB/GYN, and we have one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country. Georgia’s extreme abortion ban risks worsening our state’s women’s health crisis. I again call on Georgia’s state Legislature and the governor to repeal this extreme abortion ban.”

May 17 2023,N.C. abortion override succeeds,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,left,https://arkansasonline.com/news/2023/may/17/nc-abortion-override-succeeds,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- Legislation banning most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy will become law in North Carolina after the state's Republican-controlled General Assembly successfully overrode the Democratic governor's veto late Tuesday.

The House completed the second and final part of the override vote Tuesday night after a similar three-fifths majority voted for the override earlier Tuesday in the Senate. The outcome represents a major victory for Republican legislative leaders, who needed every GOP member on board to enact the law over Gov. Roy Cooper's opposition.

Cooper vetoed the measure over the weekend after spending last week traveling around the state in an effort to persuade at least one Republican to uphold his expected veto.

Republicans have pitched the measure as a middle-ground change to state law, which currently bans nearly all abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, without exceptions for rape or incest.

The vote came as abortion rights in the U.S. faced another tectonic shift with lawmakers debating laws to sharply limit abortion in North and South Carolina, two of the few remaining Southern states with relatively easy access.

Under another bill up for a vote Tuesday, in the South Carolina House, abortion access would be almost entirely banned after about six weeks of pregnancy. The South Carolina state Senate rejected a proposal to nearly outlaw abortions.

Nationally, bans on abortion throughout pregnancy are in effect in 14 states, including Arkansas.

During the North Carolina Senate debate, Republicans said Cooper ignored $160 million within the measure that would boost funding to increase contraceptive services, reduce infant and maternal mortality and provide paid maternity leave for state employees and teachers.

""North Carolinians watching this debate, you are bearing witness to exaggerated and extremist objections from some Democrats,"" Republican Sen. Vickie Sawyer of Iredell County said. ""Their anger is that this bill is mainstream and a common-sense approach to a very difficult topic.""

Democrats focused on details of the abortion rules, which they say would place barriers between women and their doctors, leaving those who are pregnant in danger.

The 12-week cutoff means that young women will have potentially only a couple of weeks to decide whether an abortion is the right decision, leading them to continue with unwanted pregnancies, Democratic Sen. Natasha Marcus said.

""This bill is a slap in the face. It is a muzzle over our mouths, and it is a straitjacket on our bodies,"" Marcus said. After the Senate vote, loud chants of ""Shame!"" could be heard outside the chamber doors.

Anti-abortion protesters who arrived hours before the vote packed the North Carolina Senate gallery.

In South Carolina, the impasse dates back to a special session last fall when House lawmakers demanding a near-total ban did not meet to negotiate with their Senate counterparts pushing for a ban around six weeks.

A sharp increase in abortions since then has rankled Republicans.

The House was weighing a Senate bill similar to the one they denied last year. The measure would ban abortion when an ultrasound detects cardiac activity, around six weeks.

A late night was expected even after Republicans invoked rules to limit debate. House Speaker Murrell Smith has said the chamber will not adjourn until the measure gets approval. Democrats began slowing the process Tuesday by speaking for all three allotted minutes on each of their hundreds of amendments and forcing other procedural votes.

Lawmakers in Nebraska were debating a proposal that would ban abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy. Conservatives in Nebraska's unique single-chamber, officially nonpartisan Legislature will need 33 out of 49 votes for these proposals to advance.

In Montana, Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte's office announced Tuesday that he had signed into law a bill that makes performing an abortion by the method most commonly used after 15 weeks of gestation a felony. Planned Parenthood of Montana asked a judge to temporarily block the ban on dilation and evacuation abortions.

A separate challenge to abortion access will be considered today, when a federal appeals court hears arguments on whether the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the widely used abortion drug mifepristone should be overturned.

A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will review a ruling last month by a federal judge in Texas who ordered a hold on approval of mifepristone, a decision that overruled two decades of scientific approval of the drug. That ruling was stayed while the appeal is pending.

Sep 29 2023,Appeals Court Reverses Previous Ruling That Halted Idaho Abortion Ban,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/09/29/appeals-court-reverses-ruling-halted-red-state-abortion-ban,"The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a lower court decision to block Idaho’s abortion ban Thursday, according to court documents.

U.S. District Court Judge for the District of Idaho B. Lynn Winmill, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, ruled in August that the law could stop doctors from referring patients to abortion clinics in other states in an emergency due to fear of prosecution. A panel of judges appointed by former President Donald Trump, however, determined that the state’s case to uphold the ban was likely to succeed and that for the time being “public interest is best served by preserving the force and effect of a duly enacted Idaho law,” according to court documents. (RELATED: Texas AG Sues Tech Giant Over Its ‘Misleading’ Warning Labels For Pregnancy Centers)

“The federal government has no discernable interest in regulating the internal medical affairs of the State, and the public interest is best served by preserving the force and effect of a duly enacted Idaho law during the pendency of this appeal,” the court wrote. “Therefore, the balance of the equities and the public interest support a stay in this case.”

The trigger law was passed in March 2020 but did not go into effect until after the Supreme Court overturned Roe in June 2022 and bans all abortion except in the cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother, according to the legislation. Doctors who violate this law face felony charges and up to five years imprisonment.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against the state in August 2022, arguing that the law would allow the state to charge any physician who performs an abortion to protect the “health of the pregnant patient” with a crime, according to court documents. The department claimed that the enforcement of the bill would also conflict with the Emergency Medical Treatment Act, which ensures “public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay and Labor Act,” but the appeals court noted that the state Supreme Court had cleared this issue up in its ruling in January for a different lawsuit.

“The Supreme Court of Idaho clarified that the text of the exception means what it says: If a doctor subjectively believes, in his or her good faith medical judgment, that an abortion is necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman, then the exception applies,” the opinion reads.

The DOJ’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Aug 23 2023,Republican debate: Candidates split on federal action on abortion,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/republican-debate-candidates-split-action-abortion,"

The eight presidential candidates on the GOP debate stage in Milwaukee were torn on the issue of abortion.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley emphasized a practical approach to the controversial procedure, saying that “we need to stop demonizing the issue” to find consensus on banning late-term abortions, encouraging adoption, and protecting healthcare providers who have a contentious objection to the procedure.

UP FOR DEBATE: WHERE TRUMP, DESANTIS, AND REST OF REPUBLICAN 2024 FIELD STAND ON KEY ISSUES

Former Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) pushed back on Haley’s pragmatism, both saying they support a federal minimum standard of blocking abortion after 15 weeks gestation.

Medical experts typically associate 15 weeks gestation with the ability of a fetus to feel pain.

“Consensus is the opposite of leadership,” Pence said to Haley.

Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said that the abortion issue will “most likely” be addressed by states, but he interprets the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision as also giving the elected representatives in the federal government the ability to legislate on the controversial procedure.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was unclear on the issue, saying he would support “a culture of life” but refusing to state a national limit explicitly.

Gov. Doug Burgum (R-ND) said that he would not support a national abortion limitation, including a ban on late-term abortion, citing the 10th Amendment, which gives all unenumerated powers to the states.

Haley got the last word in on the abortion debate, saying there has not been a majority of anti-abortion senators in decades.

“Be honest with the American people,” Haley said.

On Thursday, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued a unanimous order granting Idaho's request to temporarily suspend the injunction as the State of Idaho pursues an appeal against the District Court's ruling.

The release says the federal government used the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA) to impede Idaho's abortion regulation. The panel clarified that EMTALA will not preempt nor conflict with Idaho law, which permits abortion when medically necessary.

Sep 28 2023,MT judge stalls start date for upcoming abortion licensure requirement,Independent Record,center,https://helenair.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/montana-abortion-provider-licensure-requirement-start-date-arguments/article_f55d7666-5e0e-11ee-9bc2-cfd3a8a0c4a5.html,"A District Court judge in Helena on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order stalling a new law requiring abortion providers to be licensed, because the state health department has not yet established a licensing program with which providers could comply by the Oct. 1 start date.

The legal challenge against House Bill 937 is not over: A temporary restraining order blocks the new law from taking effect until further arguments on a lengthier injunction, which would put the brakes on that law over the duration of the case.

In his decision Wednesday, Lewis and Clark County District Court Judge Christopher Abbott set a hearing for those arguments for Oct. 30.

Blue Mountain Clinic of Missoula and All Families Healthcare of Whitefish earlier this month sought the restraining order, arguing the new law requires providers to comply with a licensure program the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services had not yet stood up. Helen Weems, an abortion provider and the founder of All Families Healthcare, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit.

Attorneys for the state argued the legal challenge was premature, because enforcement mechanisms had likewise not yet been established to enforce the licensure matter.

""The problem,"" Abbott wrote in Wednesday's order, ""is that Providers are not yet licensed by the Department, and everyone agrees they cannot get a license by Oct. 1.""

Abortion providers lauded the order late Wednesday.

""Today’s decision is critical for people accessing abortion care in Montana, and a defeat against extremist lawmakers who are seeking to ban abortion by any means,"" Aileen Gleizer of Blue Mountain Clinic said in a press release. ""The temporary restraining order will allow our clinics to continue to provide high-quality abortion care.""

The Attorney General's Office looks forward to presenting their arguments to defend the law, spokesperson Emilee Cantrell said in an email Thursday.

Abbott's order was the second in a single day to stall a new law from taking effect on an Oct. 1 start date. In Missoula, District Court Judge Jason Marks issued a preliminary injunction on a ban on gender-affirming care, passed by the Legislature in Senate Bill 99, from becoming law while that bill is under legal challenge from two transgender children, their parents and two medical providers."

Associated Press

An Idaho woman and her son have been charged with kidnapping after prosecutors say they took the son’s minor girlfriend out of state to get an abortion.

Court documents show Idaho police began investigating the mother and son earlier this summer after a 15-year-old girl’s mother told authorities her daughter had been sexually assaulted and later taken to Oregon to have an abortion.

With some narrow technical exceptions, abortion is banned throughout pregnancy in Republican-controlled Idaho. The procedure is legal in left-leaning Oregon, prompting many patients to cross the state border for services, a trend anti-abortion opponents have struggled to stifle ever since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion last year.

Idaho’s Republican-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Brad Little are seeking more ways to curb abortion as well. Recently, the state made it illegal to help minors get an abortion without their parents’ consent, legislation aimed at preventing minors who don’t have parental approval from getting abortions out of state. However, that law is being challenged in court, and prosecutors in the kidnapping case aren’t relying on it.

According to an affidavit, the mother of the girl who travelled for the abortion believed her daughter was living with her father, but told authorities she later discovered the teen was staying at her boyfriend’s house for several months in Pocatello, Idaho.

The girl told law enforcement officials she began having a consensual sexual relationship with her boyfriend when he was 17 and she was 15. The relationship continued when he turned 18, right around when the girl said she became pregnant.

According to court documents, the girl said she was “happy” when she found out she was pregnant, but her boyfriend was not — warning that he would not pay for child support and that he would end their relationship.

The boyfriend’s mother later demanded the girl not to tell her parents and threatened to “kick her out of their house” if she did.

The girl told authorities she then traveled to Bend, Oregon — about 550 miles (885 km) from Pocatello — with her boyfriend and his mom in May to get an abortion. Police later used the girl’s cellphone data to confirm that the trio traveled to Oregon around the same time.

The mother later told police she rented a car to go with her son and the girl to Oregon and said that the abortion was “mutually agreed upon” between the girl and her son. She said she she never “coerced” anyone into having an abortion.

Prosecutors have since charged the mother with second-degree kidnapping and the son with the same charge, along with rape and three counts of producing child sexually exploitative material after authorities said that the boyfriend captured sexually explicit video and photos of the girl.

The mother is also facing multiple drug charges.

Prosecutors say the kidnapping charges were brought because the mother and son intended to “keep or conceal” the girl from her parents by transporting “the child out of the state for the purpose of obtaining an abortion.”

Both the mother and son have been assigned a public defender, David Martinez, who said he was assigned the case the day before and declined to comment."

Marshall has suggested his office would “look at” groups who provide abortion assistance. Alabama bans abortion at any stage of pregnancy with no exceptions for rape and incest. The only exemption is if a pregnancy seriously threatens the pregnant patient’s health. Marshall’s office said he is prepared to defend state law.

Oct 31 2023,Kansas judge blocks state ban on abortion pill and ends 24-hour wait period,Boing Boing,left,https://boingboing.net/2023/10/31/kansas-judge-blocks-state-ban-on-abortion-pill-and-ends-24-hour-wait-period.html,"Kansas legislators' ban on abortion pills was put on hold by a judge there Monday. District Judge K. Christopher Jayaram also blocked the state's 1997 law requiring women to wait 24 hours for an abortion after requesting one. The ruling follows a 2022 statewide vote in Kansas which affirmed support for abortion access under the state constitution.

""The Court has great respect for the deeply held beliefs on either side of this contentious issue,"" Jayaram wrote in his 92-page order. ""Nevertheless, the State's capacity to legislate pursuant to its own moral scruples is necessarily curbed by the Kansas Constitution and its Bill of Rights."" Jayaram's order is set to remain in effect through the trial set for the end of June 2024 for a lawsuit filed by abortion providers, against state officials who would enforce abortion restrictions. The providers filed their case in Johnson County in the Kansas City area, home to two clinics that provide abortions.

This is why conservatives are so desperate to prevent votes on abortion access. They tend to lose them, and those votes can directly shape state constitutions. They are getting desperate in Ohio, next up, despite inconclusive polls."
Nov 08 2023,‘Heartbreaking’—Ed Stetzer and Other Pro-Life Leaders Respond to Ohio Enshrining Abortion in State Constitution,ChurchLeaders.com,center,https://churchleaders.com/news/462221-heartbreaking-ed-stetzer-pro-life-leaders-ohio-abortion-state-constitution.html,"Ohio voters have enshrined the right to abortion in their state constitution, making Ohio the seventh state to protect abortion access since the demise of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Issue 1, which was passed Tuesday, Nov. 7, says that abortions may be prevented only after “fetal viability” (determined by the patient’s physician) and that abortion may not be prohibited if a physician determines “it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”

“Heartbreaking vote in Ohio,” said Dr. Ed Stetzer, editor-in chief of Outreach magazine and dean of the Talbot School of Theology. “We need to change hearts & laws.”

Heartbreaking vote in Ohio. The amendment language was not great, but still used the phrase “unborn child” three times. Yet, Ohioans approved the amendment.

Issue 1 Passes in Ohio

As stated on the ballot, Issue 1 begins:

Every individual has a right to make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions, including but not limited to decisions on:

contraception; fertility treatment; continuing one’s own pregnancy; miscarriage care; and abortion.

The amendment goes on to say that the state may not infringe upon this right, whether it pertains to an individual or an outside party, with an exception relating to the patient’s health.

“However, abortion may be prohibited after fetal viability,” says Issue 1. “But in no case may such an abortion be prohibited if in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician it is necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”

The amendment defines “fetal viability” as “the point in a pregnancy when, in the professional judgment of the pregnant patient’s treating physician, the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus with reasonable measures. This is determined on a case-by-case basis.”

The Ohio ballot includes explanations for why supporters wanted people to vote in favor of the amendment and why opponents wanted people to vote against it. Among other reasons, supporters argued that the amendment is necessary to protect women in cases of rape, incest, or when their lives are at risk.

Opponents argued that the amendment “establishes abortion-on-demand through all nine months,” prevents parents from being involved when their children seek abortions, and gets rid of health protections. Ballotpedia reports that Issue 1 passed by 56.6% to 43.4%."

ALASKA FLA. HAWAII Republican-led states started banning abortion more than nine months before Roe v. Wade was overturned. Texas was the first to act, outlawing most abortions on Sept. 1, 2021. Oklahoma went one step further in May 2022, enacting a near-total ban that forced all of the state’s clinics to stop providing abortions while Roe was still the law of the land. Then came the day — June 24, 2022 — when abortion access was upended nationwide. With its landmark decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court cleared the way for 11 states to immediately halt all or most abortions. For the first time in nearly 50 years, abortion was no longer a constitutional right in the United States. Today, one year after the court swept away the protections established by Roe, 17.5 million women of reproductive age — about a quarter of all women in that age bracket in the United States — live where abortion is banned or mostly banned.

New restrictions across the South and Midwest have led to at least 24,290 fewer legal abortions since the ruling, according to research conducted by the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights. The laws have also prompted widespread confusion and fear as hospitals have turned away patients with potentially life-threatening pregnancy conditions. In a new survey of OB/GYNs conducted by KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization, approximately 40 percent of respondents who practice in states with abortion bans say they have faced constraints caring for patients experiencing miscarriages or other pregnancy-related emergencies since the ruling.

But in many respects, as America begins the second year of life after Roe, the full impact of the ruling remains unclear — and in flux.

Interviews with more than 30 key players in the abortion rights debate, including advocates, lawmakers and doctors, found that the stark lines dividing post-Roe America — with some states restricting abortion access and other states expanding it — have become far blurrier than many anticipated in the 12 months since the ruling.

A rapidly expanding underground network of abortion pill providers is helping people who live in states with bans self-manage their abortions — ending an unknown number of pregnancies.

Meanwhile, the swell of criminal prosecutions that many abortion rights advocates feared would follow the ruling has yet to materialize, further empowering those who are helping to distribute pills to people in states where abortion is banned.

In addition, legal abortions have spiked in states that neighbor regions with abortion bans — including North Carolina, Illinois, Colorado and Florida — suggesting that tens of thousands of patients have traveled out of state since the decision.

And while many Republicans raced last summer to embrace the strictest abortion bans possible — at times without exceptions for rape or incest — some in the party have become reluctant to crack down further, fearing political backlash from voters who have repeatedly demonstrated their support for abortion rights. Lawmakers in some Republican-led states have started coalescing behind bans after 12 weeks of pregnancy that allow most abortions to continue.

Now, the fight over abortion has entered a fragile new phase, in which access could be upended again by the 2024 presidential election and several pending court decisions. Strict bans are blocked by the courts in at least six states, while the Supreme Court may take up a case that could revoke government approval of a key abortion drug used nationwide. In addition, a new ban in Florida could soon halt most abortions in the country’s third most populous state, if the state Supreme Court allows it to take effect.

“The system is still trying to find its balance,” said Rebecca Gomperts, the founder of Aid Access, a Europe-based organization that mails abortion pills to all 50 states, including states where abortion is banned. “There is still a lot to come.”

Antiabortion leaders say they are eager and determined to crack down further.

“I think we’re farther than anyone would have expected we would be,” said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, a national antiabortion organization. “But am I complacent with that? Hell no.”

Whether the bans are succeeding in compelling significantly more women to carry their pregnancies to term remains unknown, with data on legal abortions muddied by the many who are choosing to self-manage abortions with medication.

Only in Texas, where a roughly six-week abortion ban took effect in 2021, has relevant birth data started to emerge. Early government numbers show that the Texas birthrate spiked by 4.7 percent from 2021 to 2022, the greatest increase in birthrate of any state in the country during that period — a pattern that experts say can be partly attributed to the state’s abortion restrictions.

Not everyone with an unwanted pregnancy has been able to effectively navigate the complicated post-Roe landscape, said a woman who joined the abortion pill network a few days after Roe was overturned. Many people have never heard of the various overseas organizations offering abortion pills, she added.

“Band-Aids can’t fix bullet holes,” she said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss illegal activity. “And we are just a Band-Aid … trying our best to stop the rain with our hands.”

Abortion access one year post-Roe

When Alan Braid was forced last June to stop providing abortions in San Antonio, the now 78-year-old doctor had already mapped out plans for his post-Roe future. He soon opened two locations close to red-state borders in New Mexico and Illinois, Democrat-led states where abortion is likely to remain protected.

His first new clinic, outside Albuquerque, quickly had a full schedule, he said, with over 90 percent of patients coming from out of state, almost all from Texas.

“To drive here from the Rio Grande Valley, Corpus Christi and places like that, it’s somewhere between 10 and 12 hours, or more.”

Still, Braid said, they come.

The pattern reflects an evolving post-Roe landscape of abortion access, with 55 clinics across the South and Midwest forced to stop providing abortions and 16 new abortion clinics opening in states where abortion is legal, according to a database maintained by Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who studies abortion.

But while many women have been able to travel to states where abortion is legal, those journeys come with a high price tag — hundreds of dollars for transportation, hotels and child care, in addition to the $500 to $800 typically required for the procedure or medication itself — making such an option inaccessible to many low-income patients who can’t cover the costs or take time off work.

Aid Access received almost 60 percent more requests for pills this spring than in the months immediately following Dobbs, fielding an average of 344 orders per day in April, in the wake of attempts to ban a key abortion drug nationwide, according to Abigail Aiken, lead investigator of the Self-managed Abortion Needs Assessment Project at the University of Texas at Austin. (Some people order pills in advance to use if they become pregnant in the future, Gomperts said.)

“Because of what happened, people became more aware of the possibility of pills — they learned that they can do it themselves, and it’s easier, cheaper,” Gomperts said.

Other overseas organizations say they don’t keep track of exactly how many pills they mail, making it hard to know the number of abortions occurring outside the traditional health-care system.

“We don’t keep any records for security reasons,” said Verónica Cruz Sánchez, the director of Las Libres, a Mexico-based organization that mails abortion pills. The demand, she added, “maintains a steady pace.”

For Aid Access, the process of mailing pills became even more streamlined in mid-June, Gomperts said. The organization revamped its operation to allow doctors in Democrat-led states with “shield laws” — designed to protect health-care providers from abortion bans — to mail abortion medication to patients in states where abortion is illegal, rather than shipping pills from India, as the organization has done for years.

“I think this will make all these bans more or less ineffective because it is within the U.S. itself that the providers are stepping up,” she said.

For many people who have learned about abortion pill websites, she added, she believes abortion is now more accessible than it was before Roe fell.

The option is not a substitute for widespread access to abortion in clinics, several abortion rights advocates said. Many people aren’t comfortable taking a pill to end their pregnancies, preferring a surgical procedure, while others fear the potential risks associated with ordering illegal pills online and taking them at home alone without easy access to a medical professional.

“It is not the same consistent access of being able to go to a provider in your community, ask for the care that you seek and receive it,” said Alexis McGill Johnson, the head of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, referring to both out-of-state travel and obtaining pills online.

While those who help to distribute abortion pills in antiabortion states could be charged with a crime — and sentenced to at least several years in prison across much of the South and Midwest — state laws explicitly exempt those who are seeking abortions from prosecution.

Online chat groups and forums have emerged as a critical gathering spot for people in antiabortion states who learn they are pregnant and suddenly face a ticking clock if they want to end their pregnancies. On r/Abortion, an abortion-focused Reddit forum that helps people navigate their options, users frequently ask about Aid Access and other online pill websites, said Ariella Messing, the executive director of the Online Abortion Resource Squad, the organization that runs the forum.

“They come seeking confirmation that these things are legitimate,” said Messing, whose team now fields about 1,300 posts per month, a number that has increased significantly since the ruling. “They’ll say, ‘I just heard about this thing called Access Aid. Is this real?’” (Aid Access is widely regarded in the medical community as a safe resource for medication abortion.)

Many people seeking abortions lack accurate, up-to-date information about their options, said Messing, whose team provides information about both out-of-state clinic options and self-managed abortion. She said she’s aware that her forum serves only a select group: those who know where to seek out information.

“It’s a subset of the population who comes to this subreddit,” Messing said.

Countless other women will never find it.

Antiabortion activists push for more

One month before Texas lawmakers convened for this year’s legislative session, the state’s largest antiabortion group delivered an urgent message at the Capitol: Despite a near-total ban on abortion — which slashed the number of legal abortions in the state from 50,000 a year to a handful each month — thousands of Texas women were still finding ways to end their pregnancies.

“The new abortion clinic is as close as your pocket and your cellphone, where you can go to these websites,” John Seago, the president of Texas Right to Life, recalled saying to a group of over 100 state lawmakers and their staffers. “This is the new threat.”

Seago ticked through a list of solutions in a presentation titled “Post-Roe Lawlessness”: Block abortion pill websites. Expand civil liability. Empower the state attorney general to prosecute anyone who breaks the law.

But the same Republican-led legislature that had passed multiple abortion bans before Roe was overturned showed little interest in embracing those ideas. One by one, each of the antiabortion bills prioritized by Texas Right to Life died before it got a hearing, signaling that, at least for now, Republicans representing the state at the forefront of the antiabortion movement felt that they had done enough.

That sentiment appeared to grow across several Republican-led legislatures, where a driving desire to ban all or most abortions gave way to fear of political backlash in the wake of multiple victories by pro-abortion-rights candidates and ballot initiative campaigns during the 2022 midterm elections.

After months of debate, lawmakers in conservative Nebraska and North Carolina passed 12-week bans in May, significantly narrowing the window for legal abortion but still allowing over 90 percent of abortions to continue.

“The majority of Americans are really moderate people who want to live and let live,” said North Carolina state Sen. Amy Galey, who was part of the Republican working group that devised the 12-week law. “They don’t want a government who is probing into people’s personal lives excessively.”

That view has not prevailed everywhere. Republican-led legislatures in South Carolina and Florida recently passed laws to ban abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before most people know they are pregnant — though neither law is in effect, each pending a court decision expected in the coming months. Abortion is currently legal up to 22 weeks in South Carolina and up to 15 weeks in Florida.

Florida’s six-week law, which Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has touted as a sign of his conservative bona fides as he launches a 2024 presidential bid, could singularly alter the national abortion landscape once again, given the number of abortions in the third most populous state. Clinics in states where abortion is legal are already scrambling to meet an elevated need — and demand would grow more intense if even a fraction of the more than 80,000 people who get abortions in Florida each year attempt to travel elsewhere.

The law is written to take effect only if the state’s conservative-leaning Supreme Court approves Florida’s existing 15-week ban, which passed last spring and took effect shortly after the Dobbs ruling.

There are some indications that a six-week ban in a large state can have a measurable impact on the number of births. In the year after Texas implemented Senate Bill 8, which outlawed abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, the birthrate in the state rose by 4.7 percent, according to a Washington Post analysis of provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while birthrates across the country remained flat, upticking by only 0.2 percent.

Experts say the Texas abortion ban has probably played a role in the state’s rising birthrate. Several other factors also led to the spike, according to three demographers, including a rise in births amid a post-pandemic spike in immigration from Latin America, among a population that tends to have a higher birthrate. Florida — which, like Texas, has a large Hispanic population — also experienced a significant rise in birthrates without a strict abortion ban in place, but slightly less than in Texas.

“At least some of the increase in 2022 seems to me very likely because of S.B. 8,” said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor of demography and public health at the University of California at San Francisco who focuses on abortion. “We know that people are self-managing, but not everyone is self-managing.”

Antiabortion hard-liners, like Seago, are also hoping that, in time, Republicans will be more willing to crack down on the illegal abortion pill networks, backing measures that would help states to fully enforce their abortion bans.

Farah Diaz-Tello, legal director at If/When/How, an abortion rights organization that offers support to people who fear they might face legal consequences for their abortions, said she had not seen any situations in which people — such as community activists or family and friends of the person seeking an abortion — had been charged for distributing pills under new laws in antiabortion states. Several antiabortion activists interviewed for this story said they too had not heard of any examples of prosecutions.

One civil case has been filed by the now ex-husband of a Texas woman who obtained an abortion, against three friends who allegedly helped her access abortion pills — but documents released have called some of the ex-husband’s claims into question.

When Seago urged Texas Republicans to crack down on people involved in the illegal abortion pill network, he said, lawmakers did not want to engage.

“I heard from elected officials that women were not considering abortion in Texas anymore,” he said. “That is a delusion. It’s completely disconnected from reality.”

The road to 2024

The future of abortion access in America is far from settled.

A high-profile case to revoke government approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in over 50 percent of abortions across the country, is still making its way through the courts — and is likely to reach the Supreme Court for a second time in the coming months or years.

Meanwhile, antiabortion activists are pressuring Republican candidates to back a national ban on most abortions at 15 weeks or earlier.

“It’s not just that different states are going to play it out,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a vocal supporter of abortion rights. “The extremists are still trying to block abortion everywhere, looking for every tool to do it.”

Marjorie Dannenfelser, the head of prominent antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, countered that it’s Democrats who hold “extreme” views on abortion, contending that many refuse to say whether they support any limits.

A lot hinges on the 2024 presidential race. President Biden is expected to make his support for abortion rights a centerpiece of his reelection campaign. While the federal government’s ability to intervene in state legislation is limited, the Biden administration has issued various guidelines, executive orders and legal interpretations to protect abortion and reproductive health care, which could be rescinded by a Republican president.

“Another administration could come in and remove those protections,” Jennifer Klein, the director of the White House’s Gender Policy Council, which helps oversee the administration’s abortion policy, said in an interview. She said the administration is cognizant that “nothing will replace federal legislation,” which is why it is pushing to codify Roe into law.

When Roe was overturned, some antiabortion activists shifted their focus to the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 150-year-old law that made it illegal to send “indecent” publications through the mail, including anything that could be used for an abortion. While Biden’s Justice Department has issued guidance making the Comstock Act largely inapplicable, a Republican administration could revoke that guidance, said Jonathan Mitchell, the antiabortion lawyer behind the novel Texas abortion ban that took effect in 2021.

“I don’t think they’ll say a thing about it on the campaign trail,” Mitchell said. “The question is what will they do after taking office.”

Some Republicans in the 2024 field have struggled to articulate whether they would sign a bill imposing federal limits on abortion, and what those limits would be.

Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) initially refused to answer direct questions on what national restrictions he’d support, before committing to sign a 15-week ban. In April, former president Donald Trump drew the ire of antiabortion groups when his reelection campaign said abortion restrictions “should be decided at the state level,” and has since met with antiabortion activists.

Abortion rights advocates who scored major victories in last year’s midterm elections are now grappling with how to sustain that momentum throughout the 2024 campaign.

Part of the strategy, according to some Democrats, is to characterize any abortion limits as extreme, including 12-week bans. In response to North Carolina’s new 12-week law, for example, abortion rights groups have deployed the same rhetoric they’ve used to fight restrictions earlier in pregnancy, arguing that all abortion decisions should be between the patient and their doctor and fiercely opposing Republican efforts to describe 12-week bans as “mainstream.”

“It’s the same message, and we’re winning on that message,” said Mini Timmaraju, who leads the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America. “The longer these bans are in place, all of the bans, the more unpopular they’re getting, so our goal is defining them all as bans. None of them are good.”

Dannenfelser described every restriction passed as an “incremental gain” for the antiabortion movement, even if it doesn’t stop most abortions.

“We would say 12-week protection, we would say 12-week limit, but they would just say a ban because they want people to think that all abortions have been banned,” Dannenfelser said.

At the state level, abortion rights groups are seeking to counteract abortion bans and enshrine access to the procedure into constitutions in a handful of red states. They’ve launched campaigns to gather signatures to put abortions rights on the ballot in Ohio and Florida, while activists in Missouri have begun the lengthy process to kick off their own effort. It’s possible more states could follow suit.

Nationally, Biden has called for the Democratic-controlled Senate to scrap its long-standing filibuster rules to enshrine abortion rights into federal law. But a top Senate Republican, Minority Whip John Thune (S.D.), told The Post that the GOP, if it wins back the majority, wouldn’t use similar tactics to pursue its abortion goals and intends to keep the rule requiring 60 votes to pass legislation in place for abortion policy. Aware that a move against the filibuster by antiabortion lawmakers could backfire if party control of Congress flipped again, Dannenfelser said she also is not advocating such a move.

“There are rules we have to play by here,” Thune said."
Nov 08 2023,"""This isn't the end"": Top Ohio Republican vows effort to undo abortion amendment backed by voters",Salon,left,https://salon.com/2023/11/08/this-isnt-the-end-top-ohio-vows-effort-to-undo-abortion-amendment-backed-by,"After a majority of Ohio voters on Tuesday passed Issues 1 and 2 enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution and legalizing recreational marijuana usage, respectively, Republicans in the state are vowing to pushback on the measures in upcoming elections. ""This isn't the end,"" Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman said in a statement, per Ohio Statehouse Bureau Chief Karen Kasler. ""It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1."" Huffman had previously predicted that another abortion-related ballot issue would likely follow if Issue 1 passed, Kasler noted.

""I remain steadfastly committed to protecting life, and that commitment is unwavering,"" Ohio House Speaker Jason Stephen reportedly said in a statement. ""The legislature has multiple paths that we will explore to continue to protect innocent life. This is not the end of the conversation.” Unofficial results show that just under 57 percent of voters supported both Issue 1 and Issue 2, a state law allowing adults 21 and older to buy, possess and grow marijuana. Both take effect in 30 days, but because Issue 2 is an initiated statute, Ohio lawmakers can change it easily, according to The Columbus Dispatch.

""I can't believe in 2023 we're actually talking about elected officials not respecting the will of the voters and not respecting the outcome of an election,"" Tom Haren, a spokesman for the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, told the Dispatch. ""I expect, I think that every single voter in Ohio has a right to expect, that elected officials will implement and respect the will of voters."""
Sep 08 2023,Heated abortion debate argued before Florida Supreme Court,Sun Sentinel,center,https://sun-sentinel.com/2023/09/08/heated-abortion-debate-argued-before-florida-supreme-court,"Both sides in Florida’s closely-watched abortion challenge made their arguments Friday before the state Supreme Court on whether a 15-week abortion ban signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis should be upheld.

If upheld, the ruling would trigger a six-week abortion ban to go into effect after 30 days, which was approved by the Legislature this year and would turn Florida into a state with one of the most restrictive laws in the country.

In their argument on Friday, abortion providers relied on protections provided for decades under the state constitution to make their case for why access should be allowed until fetal viability, which is around 24 weeks. Attorney Whitney White with the American Civil Liberties Union argued the Florida Constitution’s unique privacy clause for more than 40 years has protected a right to abortion in the state and should remain in force.

“Abortion has been a recognized right in Florida for decades,” White said, representing providers from across the state, including Planned Parenthood. “There’s no basis in the text to exclude a decision so personal and so private as whether to continue a pregnancy.”

The privacy clause was put into the Florida Constitution by a voter referendum in 1980 and later affirmed as including abortion rights by the state Supreme Court. Voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment in 2012 that would have undone those decisions.

The state argued that the privacy clause in the Florida Constitution does not apply to abortion. State Solicitor General Henry Whitaker told the justices the clause was mainly meant to cover “informational privacy” such as personal records and not “decisional privacy” such as abortion.

“An act of the Legislature should not be struck down unless it is clearly unconstitutional,” Whitaker said of the new abortion bans enacted by lawmakers. “We think the state has a compelling interest in all stages of pregnancy in preserving life.”

Of the seven state Supreme Court justices who will rule on the suit against the abortion ban, five were appointed by DeSantis, who signed the 15-week ban into law in July 2022.

Several justices appeared skeptical of the abortion providers’ arguments Friday, questioning White on how she can prove the 15-week ban would lead to “irreparable harm” and asking why there’s no evidence as to whether Florida voters in 1980 were even aware that privacy included the right to access abortions.

The constitutional provision states: “Every natural person has the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life.”

Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz wondered aloud if the court should have the right to be the final call on abortion when the Florida Legislature already has had their say and voted for abortion restrictions.

Muñiz also asked White if the U.S. Supreme Court’s invalidation of the Roe v. Wade federal standard that made abortion legal in the Dobbs ruling had any impact on the Florida case.

“Should we take that into account? Should it matter to us that the entire foundation of the asserted right here that the (U.S.) Supreme Court has now said was egregiously wrong?” Muñiz asked. At one point Friday, Muñiz said that the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision “might have been an abomination” and referred to fetuses as “human beings”

White responded: “Nothing in the Dobbs decision displaces state protections for abortion that were more protective than federal law. States are free to afford that level of protection. That’s precisely what Floridians have done here.”

White also said a potential court ruling that says the privacy clause does not include abortion could have “a destabilizing impact on other areas where the clause has been applied, such as parental rights and medical decision making.”

On Friday, Muñiz and Justice Jamie Grosshans acknowledged that a ruling in the state’s favor would affect myriad other precedents unrelated to abortion that have relied on a broad interpretation of privacy rights over the past 30 years.

The privacy argument at the basis of Friday’s discussion was also used in the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined the federal right to abortion in 1973. U.S. Supreme Court justices rejected that argument in their decision to overturn Roe last summer.

The Florida lawsuit seeks an injunction blocking enforcement of the 15-week abortion ban known as HB5, which includes potential jail time of up to five years and $5,000 in fines for violations and remains in effect as the court case plays out. HB5 went into effect in 2022, shortly before Roe was overturned.

The 15-week ban includes exceptions allowing an abortion to save a woman’s life or prevent serious physical harm and in cases in which a fetus has a terminal medical condition “incompatible with life outside the womb.”

The entire hearing on Friday was over in about an hour but news conferences held by organizations for and against abortion restrictions continued throughout the day.

There is no set time frame for when the Florida Supreme Court will return a decision, and no indication from the justices on Friday about when they might rule.

If the 15-week ban is upheld, an even stricter six-week ban passed by the Republican-led Legislature this spring and signed by DeSantis would automatically take effect 30 days after the court makes a decision.

At a news conference Friday after the hearing, Kelly Flynn, CEO of Women’s Choice Clinics, said her Jacksonville clinic is busy with women from Florida and nearby states with more restrictive bans who are traveling hundreds of miles out of desperation for care.

Florida has an estimated 4 million women of childbearing age. The state Supreme Court’s ruling will affect not only abortion access in Florida, but as many as 15 million women across the South and even in the Caribbean. Women who live in places where abortion is even more restricted routinely travel to Florida for access to the procedure.

Some restrictions that apply to abortion will remain in place regardless of the court’s decision: A 24-hour waiting period between the initial consultation and the procedure, and a requirement that parents must give consent before a minor can have an abortion.

Most abortion-rights supporters are bracing for a loss at the conservative Florida court. The court during the past four years has reversed legal precedents in other cases.

“There is no doubt where the leanings of this court is, but I do believe that the legal arguments are there to uphold the special privacy protection that we have always had, here in the state of Florida,” Senate Minority Leader Lauren Book, D-Davie, told reporters after Friday’s arguments.

Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody, who attended the arguments, told reporters she supports the law.

“I happen to believe, very passionately, that life needs to be protected and that lawmakers should have the ability to do that,” she said.

Reproductive rights advocates meanwhile also are working to get a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot. The committee led by Floridians Protecting Freedom has gathered enough voter signatures from across the state to send the wording of their proposed constitutional amendment to the Florida Supreme Court for review.

The constitutional amendment must get at least 60% of the vote to pass.

“With 60% needed, it could be close,” said Mary Ziegler, a professor of law at UC Davis who chronicles the legal, political and cultural debate around abortion.

Ziegler believes a ruling that triggers a six-week ban could energize voters.

“There could be backlash to the decision and lead to a huge voter turnout,” she said. “Floridians can wait to see the Supreme Court decision, but likely they will have the final word. They get to vote on the ballot initiative and the retention of the Supreme Court Justices.”

Nov 07 2023,Ohio voters guarantee abortion rights 16 months after U.S. Supreme Court strikes Roe,Cleveland Plain Dealer,center,https://cleveland.com/open/2023/11/ohio-voters-guarantee-abortion-rights-16-months-after-us-supreme-court-strikes-roe.html,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio voters passed a state constitutional amendment Tuesday guaranteeing abortion rights and became the seventh state to side with reproductive rights since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

The amendment protects individuals’ decisions about abortion, pregnancy, contraception, miscarriage care and fertility treatment until fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks. Then the General Assembly would be allowed to regulate reproductive decisions. But women would still be allowed to get an abortion after viability if in the professional judgement of her physician it’s needed to protect her life or health.

The Associated Press called the race for the “yes” side just after 9 p.m. Tuesday. As of 10:45 p.m., Issue 1 was passing with about 55.6% of the vote and 84% of precincts reporting results.

The amendment will take effect 30 days after the election, but its practical effects could take years to ripple through the dozens of Ohio laws regulating abortion. Ultimately, courts will decide which laws conflict with the new language in the state constitution.

Nancy Kramer, co-chair of Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights, the campaign backing the amendment, said Ohioans of all political stripes don’t want the government making health care decisions for them. She spoke while the election results looked promising for the “yes” campaign but before it had won.

“When the Supreme Court delivered the Dobbs decision (overturning Roe v. Wade) they said they were sending the issue back to the states,” Kramer said. “Today, the state of Ohio will have spoken.”

Tuesday ends bitter campaigning over the abortion rights amendment that began when the “no” side, Protect Women Ohio, began airing ads in March. The campaigns have collectively spent at least $38 million, plus more in untraceable dark money, paying for campaign ads and materials.

Republican leaders in the General Assembly scheduled an $18 million special election in August intended to thwart the abortion rights amendment by requiring all future constitutional amendments pass with a supermajority at the ballot box. That was defeated and Ohio’s abortion rights amendment only needed to pass with 50% plus one vote, a simple majority.

Since the amendment allows abortion until viability, Ohio’s six week “heartbeat” abortion ban will likely be invalidated. The law was in effect for 82 days last summer until a judge put it on an indefinite hold while its overall constitutionality is litigated in his courtroom.

At an anti-Issue 2 campaign event Tuesday night, Protect Women Ohio leaders were reluctant to share next steps. Aaron Baer, a prominent socially conservative activist who was one of the group’s top leaders, said he’s still digesting the results.

“We’re going to mourn the loss of 30,000 babies a year, and we’re going to pick back up and keep fighting this stuff like we have for 50 years,” Baer said.

Republican legislative leaders were more explicit in what they planned to do next.

“Life is worth fighting for,” said Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, a Lima Republican, who supported the special election and has steered anti-abortion legislation through his chamber. “As a grandparent of eight, the life of a baby is always worth the fight. The national abortion industry funded by wealthy out-of-state special interests spent millions to pass this radical language that goes far past abortion on demand. This isn’t the end. It is really just the beginning of a revolving door of ballot campaigns to repeal or replace Issue 1.”

But the legislature’s special election – combined with ballot language written by a Republican-controlled state board led by Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose that included terms such as “unborn child” – has Ohioans sick of politics as usual, said J. Bennett “Ben” Guess, director of the ACLU of Ohio, which helped pass the amendment.

Guess encouraged the several hundred supporters who attended the “yes” election results watch party to continue to work toward reform in state government. The next potential amendment proposal in 2024 would attempt, again, to end gerrymandering of state legislative districts. That way “we finally rid this state of its corrupt, unresponsive and unrepresentative, grotesquely gerrymandered politicians.”

Other abortion bans – the legislature has passed three dozen of them since the 1980s – will likely be decided by the courts, from requiring a 24-hour waiting period to whether abortion clinics need to have transfer agreements with private hospitals inside the state and within 30 miles of the clinic.

Courts will decide the constitutionality of each ban, according to the amendment, by determining whether each is the least restrictive means to impose a ban, and whether the restriction advances a woman’s “health in accordance with widely accepted and evidence-based standards of care.”

The results were a broadside against Republican leaders who have advanced increasingly more restrictive abortion measures and a victory for progressives who have long held that their policies are popular among Ohioans.

Polling has generally shown that about 58% of Ohioans support abortion rights on some level. While the campaign against Issue 1 – which included Gov. Mike DeWine – sought to paint the proposed amendment as too extreme, Ohioans apparently disagreed.

After some initial conflict among abortion rights organizations over whether to pursue the amendment in 2023 or 2024, the groups united under national spotlight to score the signature electoral victory of the year.

Ohio was the latest domino to fall against anti-abortion forces since realizing their long-held goal of toppling Roe v. Wade. The decision in June 2022 returned the question of abortion regulation to the states, where abortion-rights backers have prevailed now on seven straight ballots.

“When abortion is on the ballot, we win,” said Kellie Copeland, executive director of Pro-Choice Ohio, which was one of several organizations backing the amendment. “We hope this victory builds momentum to our colleagues in Florida and Missouri and all the other states who will be fighting the same fight, and we will be with them, shoulder to shoulder... Ohio is not a red state. We’re purple as hell, baby.”

A wave of other statewide ballot initiatives related to abortion rights are expected across the country in 2024 at the same time that races for president and both chambers of Congress are to be decided.

“Make no mistake that today marks a dark day for the Buckeye state. After a long campaign season, Ohioans voted to enshrine murder into our state’s guiding document,” said Lizzie Marbach, an anti-abortion activist who was at odds with the campaign against Issue 1. “May these results be a lesson to pro-life organizations that refused to address this issue head on. Their cowardice during this pivotal moment should not be forgotten moving forward. The fight, however, is not over. We will continue fighting to establish equal protection under the law for the preborn based on the 14th amendment of the US Constitution.”

Ohio’s amendment drew the national spotlight on Tuesday as the only state in the nation deciding on abortion rights after six other states had done so last year and a handful of others are expected on the ballot in 2024. President Joe Biden called the amendment’s passage a win for democracy and called on Congress to reinstate the Roe standard as a federal law.

“In Ohio, voters protected access to reproductive health in their state constitution. Ohioans and voters across the country rejected attempts by MAGA Republican elected officials to impose extreme abortion bans that put the health and lives of women in jeopardy, force women to travel hundreds of miles for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors and nurses for providing the health care that their patients need and that they are trained to provide. This extreme and dangerous agenda is out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans,” Biden said in a statement released Tuesday night.

Abortions Rose in Most States This Year, New Data Shows

Legal abortions most likely increased in the United States in the first six months of the year compared with 2020, an analysis of new estimates shows, as states with more permissive abortion laws absorbed patients traveling from those with bans and access to abortion pills via telemedicine continued to expand.

New research from the Guttmacher Institute offers the latest view of legal abortions since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision last year upended access to abortion nationwide and allowed more than a dozen states to ban or restrict the procedure.

The data suggests that thousands of women have crossed state lines to obtain an abortion, in the face of restrictions at home. It also indicates a rise in abortions among those living in states where the procedure is legal.

“You have two forces at work,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College, who reviewed the Guttmacher report. “On the one hand, you have people trapped in ban states, and, on the other, you have people in a whole lot of the country where access has improved.”

Around 465,000 abortions were recorded across 50 states and Washington, D.C., in six months of 2020. Texas 29,015 Ill. 26,390 N.J. 24,415 Calif. 77,030 Ga. Pa. N.C. Va. Wash. Mass. Mich.

No estimates were provided for 2023 for 14 states that banned abortion.

Altogether, about 511,000 abortions were estimated to have occurred in areas where the procedure was legal in the first six months of 2023, a review of Guttmacher’s data shows, compared with about 465,000 abortions nationwide in a six-month period of 2020.

Abortions rose in nearly every state where the procedure remains legal, but the change was most visible in states bordering those with total abortion bans. Many of these states loosened abortion laws, and providers opened new clinics to serve patients coming from elsewhere. In Illinois, for example, where abortion is legal, abortions rose an estimated 69 percent in 2023 compared with the same period in 2020, to about 45,000 from 26,000.

Other states with restrictive neighbors, like Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico and South Carolina, also had jumps in estimated counts of abortions.

Arizona, Georgia and Indiana, by contrast, sought to restrict abortion, and all three states had drops in their estimates. Arizona and Georgia have gestational limits on the procedure, and Indiana recently enacted a total ban.

Researchers emphasized that the rise in abortions so far in 2023 does not mean that state bans have had no impact on access.

“Travel doesn’t come without a cost,” said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at the Guttmacher Institute and the lead researcher on the institute’s report. “Just because someone isn’t denied an abortion doesn’t mean it was an easy experience. And we know that some can’t leave their state.”

There are no estimates yet of women who were denied abortions or those who were unable to get them. The increases in most states may also mask the number of abortions prevented by the bans.

“Abortions had begun rising in advance of Dobbs, and they may have continued to rise even more steeply than observed if it weren’t for the bans,” Dr. Myers said.

The Guttmacher Institute’s report is based on a survey of physical abortion clinics and telehealth and virtual providers. The institute, which supports abortion rights, does not contact all clinics in each state but relies on a sample to estimate the number of abortions.

The report excludes abortions obtained outside of the formal health care system, through, for example, pills mailed into states with bans from other countries or states where abortion is legal. Other data suggests that thousands of people, especially those living in states with bans, have ordered abortion pills online from overseas.

Populous states like California, Florida, Illinois and New York had the most abortions. Because the researchers relied on a statistical model, they reported a range of uncertainty in their counts, and there was more uncertainty in states with more abortion providers. Data was not collected from the 14 states with abortion bans in effect in the first part of the year.

Source: Guttmacher Institute Notes: Researchers surveyed a sample of abortion providers in each state monthly and combined those results with historical data to produce estimates of abortion counts. Data compares January to June 2023 with a six-month period in 2020.

Researchers compared this year’s data with 2020, the most recent year of their annual provider survey and the last year before major abortion restrictions took effect. (Texas passed a six-week abortion ban in 2021, before the Dobbs decision.) Abortions were already rising that year, reversing a decades-long decline.

The data may also capture effects of other policy shifts in recent years, including the Biden administration’s decision during the pandemic to allow abortions via telemedicine, as well as other unknown impacts of the pandemic.

The state-level monthly estimates are in line with abortion statistics from January through March of this year released by WeCount, another group that surveys providers.

Both reports show significant increases in abortions in states without abortion bans, a change that anti-abortion advocates and legislators are watching closely.

“There is the feeling among legislators that we’ve passed strong laws here and yet our neighbors in Colorado or Illinois are allowing these businesses to pop up on our border,” said Katie Daniel, the state policy director at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

Researchers caution that more work is needed to better assess both the impact of abortion restrictions as well as the explosion of access to abortion pills through telehealth and underground networks.

The picture is expected to shift later this year, as more restrictions take effect. Guttmacher researchers collected abortion data before legislatures enacted bans and restrictions in Indiana, North Carolina and South Carolina."
Nov 06 2023,Beshear hopes abortion debate will help him win another term as governor in GOP-leaning Kentucky,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/news/nation/beshear-hopes-abortion-debate-will-help-him-win-another-term-as-governor-in-gop-leaning-kentucky-irrz9sst,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear won reelection to a second term Tuesday, notching another significant statewide victory in an increasingly red state that could serve as a model for other Democrats on how to thrive politically heading into next year’s defining presidential election.

“Tonight, Kentucky made a choice, a choice not to move to the right or to the left but to move forward for every single family,” Beshear told a raucous crowd of supporters in Louisville.

The governor withstood relentless attempts to connect him to Democratic President Joe Biden, especially his handling of the economy. Beshear insulated himself from the attacks by focusing on state issues, including his push for exceptions to the state's near-total abortion ban that he said would make it less extreme. His reelection gave pro-choice advocates nationwide yet another victory since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

While Beshear kept Biden at arms-length during the campaign, he benefited politically from massive infusions of federal pandemic and infrastructure money pumped into Kentucky. Biden spoke with Beshear Tuesday evening to congratulate him on his re-election win.

Beshear said his victory ""sends a loud, clear message — a message that candidates should run for something and not against someone. That a candidate should show vision and not sow division. And a clear statement that anger politics should end right here and right now.”

The win also marks the 45-year-old governor as a Democrat to watch, a candidate with the skills to win a decisive victory in difficult political terrain.

Beshear rode his stewardship over record economic growth and his handling of multiple disasters, from tornadoes and floods to the COVID-19 pandemic, to victory over Cameron, the state's attorney general and a protege of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In what could be a preview of how Democrats campaign in 2024, Beshear hammered Cameron throughout the campaign for his support of the state’s sweeping abortion ban, which makes no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.

Cameron, who was seeking to become Kentucky's first Black governor, called Beshear to congratulate his former law firm colleague on his victory.

“We all want the same thing for our future generations,” Cameron said in his concession speech. “We want a better commonwealth, one in which it can ultimately be a shining city on a hill, a model and example for the rest of the nation to follow.”

The outcome gives divided government another stamp of voter approval in Kentucky, as Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature and continue to dominate the state’s congressional delegation, including both U.S. Senate seats. Beshear has wrangled with GOP lawmakers over a series of policy issues during his tenure.

While Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman earned new four-year terms as a ticket, their win did nothing to change Kentucky’s identity as a solidly red state or prevent a Republican sweep of all other statewide constitutional offices on Tuesday’s ballot.

Republican Michael Adams won reelection as secretary of state, while GOP nominee Russell Coleman, a former U.S. attorney, claimed the job of attorney general.

Republican Allison Ball, who is finishing her second term as state treasurer, was elected state auditor. The GOP also won contests for state treasurer and state agriculture commissioner to maintain its electoral dominance in Kentucky.

Beshear’s victory sustains a family dynasty that has repeatedly defied the Bluegrass State’s tilt toward the GOP. His father, Steve Beshear, is a former two-term governor. By the end of Andy Beshear’s second term, a Beshear will have presided in the Kentucky governor’s office for 16 of the last 20 years.

Cameron tried nationalizing the campaign in a state where Republican ex-President Donald Trump remains popular. Beshear followed his successful campaign formula from 2019, when he narrowly defeated GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, by sidestepping discussion of Biden or Trump, focusing instead on Kentucky matters and emphasizing his leadership during a tumultuous first term.

In the end, Cameron was unable to overcome the personal popularity of Beshear, who became a living room fixture across Kentucky with his press conferences during the pandemic. From those briefings, Beshear became known to many Kentuckians as much by his first name as his last.

Throughout the campaign, Beshear offered an upbeat assessment of the state, while Cameron pounded away at the governor’s record and linked it to Biden. Beshear touted the state’s record-high economic development growth and record-low unemployment rates during his term, and said he has Kentucky poised to keep thriving.

The governor touted his efforts for a new Ohio River bridge that will connect Kentucky and Ohio without tolls. Beshear was rewarded Tuesday with a strong showing in key suburban Kentucky counties across the river from Cincinnati.

The race nonetheless reflected the widening gap nationally between rural and urban voters, with Beshear running up big margins in Louisville, Lexington and Cameron winning large swaths of rural Kentucky. But the Democratic governor also notched some wins in rural areas, including several Appalachian counties well beyond the suburbs of the state’s biggest cities.

Beshear was thrust into crisis management during the pandemic and when deadly tornadoes tore through parts of western Kentucky — including his father’s hometown — in late 2021, followed by devastating flooding the next summer in sections of the state’s Appalachian region in the east. The governor oversaw recovery efforts that are ongoing, offering frequent updates and traveling to stricken areas repeatedly.

Cameron blasted the governor’s restrictions during the pandemic, saying the shutdowns crippled businesses and caused learning loss among students. Beshear said his actions saved lives, mirrored those in other states and reflected guidance from the Trump administration.

Cameron and his GOP allies tried to capitalize on Beshear’s veto of a measure banning gender-affirming care for children, portraying the governor as an advocate of gender reassignment surgery for minors.

Beshear hit back, claiming his foes misrepresented his position while pointing to his faith and support for parental rights to explain his veto. He said the bill “rips away” parental freedom to make medical decisions for their children.

Beshear, a church deacon, said he believes “all children are children of God.”

In declaring victory, the governor ripped into GOP groups he accused of running ads “full of hate and division.”

“And you know what? We beat ’em all at the same time,” Beshear said.

During the campaign, Beshear denounced Cameron’s support for the state’s existing near-total abortion ban as extremist, and the governor's campaign ran a viral TV ad featuring a young woman, now in her early 20s, who revealed she was raped, and later became pregnant, by her stepfather when she was 12 years old but eventually miscarried. She took aim at Cameron in the ad, saying: “Anyone who believes there should be no exceptions for rape and incest could never understand what it’s like to stand in my shoes.”

Cameron signaled that he would sign legislation adding the rape and incest exceptions, but days later he resumed a more hardline stance, indicating during a campaign stop that he would support such exceptions “if the courts made us change that law.” It highlighted the complexities of abortion-related politics for Republicans since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.

Kayla Long cited abortion rights as an important issue for her as she cast her ballot for Beshear in Shelbyville, between Louisville and Frankfort, on Tuesday.

“I think it’s a woman’s right to choose,” she said. “And I don’t think politicians should be involved in that choice at all.”"

Sep 06 2023,"Mexican court expands access to abortion, even as U.S. restricts it",Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/06/mexico-abortion-decriminalize-supreme-court,"MEXICO CITY — The Mexican Supreme Court on Wednesday widened access to abortion, decriminalizing the procedure in federal health facilities. The ruling means that more than 70 percent of women in Mexico — including everyone who uses the federal health system — will have access to legal abortion, said the Information Group on Reproductive Choice, or GIRE. The nonprofit organization, which took the case to the Supreme Court, called the decision a “historic milestone.”

Those covered by Mexico’s national health system include federal employees, salaried workers who pay social security, and people living in poverty.

The ruling marks a growing acceptance of the procedure in Latin America, even as it’s restricted in the United States.

The Mexican court in 2021 overturned a ban on abortion in the northern state of Coahuila. That decision established jurisprudence for the entire country and has been called Mexico’s “Roe v. Wade,” a reference to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling making abortion legal in the first trimester.

But in order for that Mexican decision to have broad impact, individual states had to change their laws criminalizing abortion. Activist groups filed court challenges to force their hand, but it was a time-consuming process.

Share this article Share

Last week, Aguascalientes became the 12th of Mexico’s 32 states to decriminalize the procedure.

Wednesday’s unanimous decision will require Mexico’s federal hospitals and clinics to offer abortion. They include thousands of facilities belonging to Mexico’s Social Security Institute, or IMSS, which runs the largest public health network in Latin America.

While women’s groups cheered the decision, some antiabortion organizations condemned it. One such group, ConParticipación, tweeted that the ruling constituted “pre-natal discrimination, and abandonment of women.”

Mexico is the world’s second-largest Catholic country, and for years, the public was strongly against abortion. But attitudes have been changing — here and in other parts of Latin America.

A vociferous feminist movement known as the “Green Tide” has pressed for abortion rights around the region. Argentina, Uruguay and Colombia have decriminalized the procedure, while Chile has eased restrictions. Yet some countries have maintained strict bans, including El Salvador and Honduras."
Nov 06 2023,"GOP Attorneys General Sue FDA over Approval of ‘Risky, Untested’ Mail-Order Abortion Pills",National Review (News),right,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/gop-attorneys-general-sue-fda-over-approval-of-risky-untested-mail-order-abortion-pills/,
Aug 17 2023,U.S. ruling would end mailing abortion drug,Arkansas Democrat-Gazette,left,https://arkansasonline.com/news/2023/aug/17/us-ruling-would-end-mailing-abortion-drug,"NEW ORLEANS -- Mail-order access to a drug used in the most common form of abortion in the U.S. would end under a federal appeals court ruling issued Wednesday that cannot take effect until the Supreme Court weighs in.

The decision by three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans overturned part of a lower court ruling that would have revoked the Food and Drug Administration's 23-year-old approval of mifepristone. But it left intact part of the ruling that would end availability of the drug by mail, allow it to be used through only the seventh week of pregnancy rather than the 10th, and require that it be administered in the presence of a physician.

Those restrictions won't take effect right away because the Supreme Court previously intervened to keep the drug available during the legal fight.

The panel's ruling would reverse changes the FDA made in 2016 and 2021 that eased some conditions for administering the drug.

""In loosening mifepristone's safety restrictions, FDA failed to address several important concerns about whether the drug would be safe for the women who use it,"" Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote for the panel. She was joined by Judge Cory Wilson. Judge James Ho dissented, arguing to fully uphold a Texas-based federal judge's April ruling that would revoke the drug's approval, which the FDA granted in 2000.

During the hearing, the judges expressed skepticism that the FDA appropriately considered the safety risks of mifepristone before the agency approved it for use in 2000 and again when it took steps to loosen restrictions on the drug in later years.

While the majority said it was too late to challenge the legality of the initial approval of mifepristone by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000, it upheld some limits imposed by the Texas judge. The appeals court said FDA decisions after 2016 -- allowing the drug to be taken later in pregnancy and mailed directly to patients -- were likely unlawful and should be rolled back.

President Joe Biden's administration said it would appeal, with Vice President Kamala Harris decrying the potential effect on abortion rights, as well as on the availability of other medications.

""It endangers our entire system of drug approval and regulation by undermining the independent, expert judgment of the FDA,"" Harris' statement said.

Abortion rights advocates said the ruling poses a major threat to abortion availability following last year's Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and the nationwide right to abortion.

""If the Supreme Court affirms this decision, it will prevent patients from receiving their medication in the mail in all 50 states in the nation,"" Jennifer Dalven of the American Civil Liberties Union said during an online news conference. ""That means that patients will have to travel often hundreds of miles, especially if they're coming from a state that has banned abortion, for the sole purpose of picking up a pill.""

Abortion opponents hailed the ruling, although they, too, might appeal to seek full revocation of the FDA's approval of the drug.

""Chemical Abortion Pills take one life almost every time, an innocent child, and exposes women to all kinds of known problems,"" said a statement from the anti-abortion Students for Life of America.

Erin Hawley, an attorney for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which filed the Texas lawsuit, said her organization had not yet decided whether to appeal to the Supreme Court to try to get mifepristone's approval fully revoked. The conservative Christian legal group was also involved in the Mississippi case that led to the June 2002 Supreme Court ruling that has allowed states to ban abortion.

""Today the 5th Circuit rightly required the FDA to do its job and to restore crucial safeguards for women and girls,"" Hawley said during a call with reporters after the decision was released.

An attorney for drugmaker Danco Laboratories, which argued in favor of upholding the FDA approval and revisions, did not respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment. Drugmaker GenBioPro, which was not part of the lawsuit, noted that the ruling would keep its generic mifepristone available, subject to the restrictions.

""We remain concerned about extremists and special interests using the courts in an attempt to undermine science and access to evidence-based medication, as well as attempts to undermine the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's regulatory authority,"" GenBioPro CEO Evan Masingill said in a statement.

THE LEGAL BATTLE

Mifepristone is part of a two-drug regimen used in more than half of U.S. abortions and first approved for use in this country more than 20 years ago. The legal battle over the medication has intensified since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade's grant of a constitutional right to abortion last June, a decision that spurred multiple states to further limit or ban the procedure.

The challenge to mifepristone was brought by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, an association of anti-abortion doctors and others. The group asserted that the FDA did not sufficiently consider safety concerns when it approved the drug or when it subsequently removed some restrictions -- extending the approved use of mifepristone, for instance, through 10 weeks of pregnancy instead of seven.

The lawsuit was filed in Amarillo, Texas, where U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a Trump nominee with long-held anti-abortion views, is the sole sitting judge. He issued an unprecedented ruling, for the first time suspending FDA approval of a human drug over objections from the agency. Kacsmaryk's mifepristone opinion included language used by antiabortion activists, referring to abortion providers as ""abortionists"" and to fetuses and embryos as ""unborn humans.""

Kacsmaryk sided with the group of anti-abortion doctors behind the lawsuit and said the agency fast-tracked approval of the drug without sufficient scientific evidence because it was facing significant political pressure to expand abortion access. The government argued it had more than two decades of evidence showing the pill was safe to use.

The Justice Department, representing the FDA, and the drug manufacturer Danco Laboratories appealed Kacsmaryk's ruling to the 5th Circuit. They emphasized the FDA's reliance on dozens of studies involving thousands of patients to approve the medication, which has been used by more than 5 million women, and argued that serious side effects occur in fewer than 1% of patients.

Lawyers defending the drug said the anti-abortion challengers had no legal right, or standing, to file the lawsuit because they were not directly harmed by the FDA's approval of the abortion pill. They also argued that allowing a court to revoke approval of an approved medication would jeopardize access to other kinds of drugs and more broadly harm medical research and innovation.

When new drug safety issues emerge after FDA approval, the agency is required to monitor medicines on the market, evaluate emerging issues and take action to protect U.S. patients, a responsibility Congress delegated to the FDA more than a century ago.

During a May 17 hearing, the 5th Circuit panel pushed back frequently against assertions that Kacsmaryk's April 7 ruling was unprecedented and unwarranted.

Kacsmaryk, Ho and Wilson are all appointees of former President Donald Trump. Elrod was appointed to the 5th Circuit by former President George W. Bush. All of the judges have a history of supporting abortion restrictions.

Ho argued that the approval violated the 19th-century Comstock Act. He also said the FDA gave the green light to mifepristone under a law that allows approval for drugs that treat serious or life-threatening illness. ""Pregnancy is not an illness,"" Ho wrote.

Ho, in his dissent, said he would have affirmed Kacsmaryk's order blocking the sale of the abortion drug, adding that the FDA hadn't properly vetted the pill.

The legal battle over mifepristone thus far has been limited to Kacsmaryk's temporary order and has not been fought over the merits of the lawsuit itself.

Once there is a final ruling on the temporary order, litigation on the merits of the case will continue in district court in Texas, and Kacsmaryk will rule on whether federal approval of mifepristone should be permanently revoked. The outcome of the high-profile case has the potential to upend access to medication abortion across the country, even in states where it remains legal.

""Today's ruling does not affect the availability of mifepristone,"" Alexis McGill Johnson, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement. ""But the 5th Circuit's opinion makes it clear that mifepristone's approval is very much still at risk, as is the FDA's independence.""

Oct 18 2023,San Antonio Sued by Texas Anti-Abortion Groups for Creating a Reproductive Health Fund,Jezebel,left,https://jezebel.com/san-antonio-sued-by-texas-anti-abortion-groups-for-crea-1850938276,"Anti-abortion rights demonstrators protest during a Women’s March in Austin, Texas on Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022. Photo:Montinique Monroe/Bloomberg (Getty Images)

In September, the San Antonio City Council passed a record $3.7 billion budget, which included approval of $500,000 for a reproductive health fund. The fund is intended to help cover out-of-state travel for abortion patients, but could also cover things like STD testing and health training, according to Axios. The budget took effect October 1 and, on Tuesday, a bunch of anti-abortion groups sued the city, its mayor, and its city manager, to block the fund.

The lawsuit was submitted by Jonathan Mitchell (the architect of Texas’ six-week abortion ban and bounty hunter scheme) and aims to prevent groups like Buckle Bunnies (an abortion fund that helps people find out-of-state abortion care and funds practical support options), legal group Jane’s Due Process (who work with minors to obtain abortion care), and Sueños Sin Fronteras (a group that helps immigrants obtain abortion care) from getting funding. Texas Right to Life, San Antonio Family Association, and Texas Leadership Coalition are among some of the groups suing.

Many abortion funds in Texas paused their work after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, but in February 2023, a federal judge ruled that abortion funds “likely cannot be criminally charged” for providing funding for out-of-state travel, according to the Texas Tribune. But in an interview with Jezebel Texas Right to Life President John Seago said this lawsuit is the next step toward stopping abortion patients from leaving the state.

“We’re trying to say, you know, by even assisting a woman and paying for a woman’s travel outside of the state, that would count, that would be prohibited by Texas law,” Seago told Jezebel by phone. “These organizations have helped women order abortion drugs online and have them delivered in Texas, that’s also illegal.”

Meanwhile, San Antonio city attorney Andy Segovia said that while

the funds have yet to be dispersed, a lawsuit won’t derail that work. “It is unfortunate taxpayer funds will be spent on defending against this lawsuit based on misinformation and false allegations,” Segovia said in a statement to Jezebel. “The facts are that a decision has not been made on how that money will be used. The City Council will have an open work session to discuss the use of the funds that will be managed by the City’s Metro Health Department. The funds will be distributed in accordance with State and Federal Laws.”

However, groups like Texas Right to Life maintain that the groups are committing crimes. “We’re trying to get as a clear, you know, kind of ruling that these are criminal activities, and any city that wants to fund those activities would be now participating in this criminal endeavor,” Seago told Jezebel. “And that’s really important that we get that cleared up in court to stop these organizations from what they’ve been doing for the last few years.”

This isn’t the first time this tactic has come up in a Mitchell-represented lawsuit. Earlier this month, a woman whose friends are being sued by her ex-husband (represented by Mitchell) for allegedly helping her procure abortion pills was subpoenaed to provide communication about her alleged abortion and her friends’ behavior.

“We’re still gonna fund San Antonio abortions,” Buckle Bunnies tweeted on Tuesday night. Jane’s Due Process interim executive director Jaymie Cobb told KSAT that the fund can be used to pay for abortion as well as postpartum and prenatal support. “But, you know, reproductive justice is about more than abortion, and it is about abortion. So we are hopeful,” Cobb told the television station. “And what we’re doing is not illegal. We are helping people access to health care that they deserve to have in their home state.”"

Aug 15 2023,Dems Outraged at RFK Jr. After Abortion Comments,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/kennedy-abortion-democrats/2023/08/15/id/1130795,"Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sparked outrage from Democrat colleagues after his remarks Sunday on abortion restrictions, The Hill reported.

At the Iowa State Fair, Kennedy told a reporter with NBC News that women should have the right to have an abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. After that, ""the state has an interest"" in deciding if abortions should be restricted, he said.

His response indicated he would support a federal ban on abortion after the first three months.

Kennedy's campaign quickly issued a statement on kennedy24.com to clarify his position.

""Today, Mr. Kennedy misunderstood a question posed to him by an NBC reporter in a crowded, noisy exhibit hall at the Iowa State Fair,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Kennedy's position on abortion is that it is always the woman's right to choose. He does not support legislation banning abortion.""

The clarification did not satisfy some Democrats, according to The Hill.

""The questions posed to him by NBC were clear; he wasn't confused. A transcript has been released,"" said Ameshia Cross, a Democratic strategist and commentator. ""He was offered ample opportunity to clarify his statements, especially in light of the growing outcry for more access to abortion rights and women's reproductive health, not less.

""RFK Jr. has never tried to appeal to Democrats or the party's primary voters. His stance on abortion access runs an affront to not only the Democratic Party but the majority of Americans regardless of partisan stripe.""

Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democrat operative and campaign veteran, added: ""RFK Jr.'s comments are further proof that he doesn't represent the views of Democratic voters. An anti-vax, COVID-denying, anti-choice candidate like Kennedy should find himself right at home with his pals in the Republican Party.

""Republicans can attempt to dress Kennedy up as a Democrat but it's still just lipstick on a pig."""

The pro-life movement suffered a blow this week in two states after Nevada’s Republican governor signed a pro-abortion bill into law and the Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down two of the state’s restrictions on abortion.

Nevada

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo signed legislation late Tuesday to protect abortionists who violate abortion laws in other states and prevent health care licensing boards from disqualifying a person due to his or her participation in providing abortions.

The bill prohibits the execution of arrest warrants or extradition of a person who is wanted in another state for performing an illegal abortion if such an abortion is legal in Nevada. It also prohibits state agencies from providing any information that would assist in another state imposing civil or criminal penalties on someone who performs an illegal abortion when such an abortion would have been legal in Nevada."
Sep 18 2023,Pro-choice organizations celebrate return of abortions to Wisconsin Planned Parenthood,WTMJ 4 Milwaukee,center,https://tmj4.com/news/local-news/pro-choice-organizations-celebrate-return-of-abortions-to-wisconsin-planned-parenthood,"MILWAUKEE — A rally held outside the Milwaukee County Courthouse supported Planned Parenthood’s decision to resume abortion services in Wisconsin.

The grassroots organizations there say the decision is a win for their movement, but that their fight isn’t over yet.

Lauren Forbush helped create Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee (RJA-M) after Roe V. Wade was overturned.

“I know that we all just started this because we couldn't just sit back and do nothing anymore,” said Forbush.

She says their group has spent the last 15 months fighting for access to abortions and reproductive care in Wisconsin. Now that it's back, they say the advocacy only continues.

“There’s a lot of work to be done,” continued Forbush. “The ban still has to be overturned and there is a lot of accessibility issues when it comes to abortion services.”

While it's a day of celebration for groups like RJA-M, the pro-life organization Wisconsin Right to Life was gathering in Madison to fight the decision.

“This is a very heavy day for all of us in pro-life advocacy,” said Gracie Skogman with Wisconsin Right to Life. “We're very saddened by this update and again we really know that we're fighting for life. We're fighting for the protection of the most vulnerable in our society. This is a very devastating setback.”

Skogman says the ultimate ruling is still up to the state's highest court.

“At this point, we are waiting on the final decision from the court, and ultimately just hopeful that life can continue to be saved here in the state.”

In the meantime, pro-choice advocates in Milwaukee celebrating what they believe is a step in the right direction.

“When we come together and we fight, we get stuff done,” Forbush said.

Aug 11 2023,Ohio Shows Abortion Rights is a Winner. Transphobia is a Loser.,Washington Monthly,left,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/08/11/ohio-shows-abortion-rights-is-a-winner-transphobia-is-a-loser,"Ohio’s rejection of Issue 1 proves that protecting abortion rights is a political winner. It’s also proof that attacking transgender rights is a political loser.

On its face, Issue 1 was a mere procedural matter, a ballot initiative changing Ohio’s constitution and raising the threshold for future amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent voter approval. But Republicans rushed an August special election to thwart the upcoming November referendum on a proposed constitutional amendment establishing a “fundamental right to reproductive freedom.”

One Person One Vote, the liberal coalition group leading the opposition campaign, was eager to connect the dots. When Ohio’s Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican and Issue 1 supporter, was caught on video at a GOP event saying of the amendment, “Yes, it’s about abortion,” One Person One Vote cut an ad repeating the clip three times in 30 seconds.

Conservatives were not nearly as eager. Not only had LaRose repeatedly claimed Issue 1 was not about abortion, but the top producer of Yes on 1 ads, Protect Women Ohio, also avoided the connection. Instead, the ads from Protect Women Ohio primarily sold the proposal to prevent the enshrinement of transgender rights.

“You promised you’d keep the bad guys away,” a worried female narrator intones over a video of a child being tucked into bed in its ad “Your Promise.” As a drag queen reads to children, the narrator warns of “out-of-state special interests that put trans ideology in classrooms and encourage sex changes for kids.” By voting Yes, “You can keep this madness out of Ohio classrooms and protect your rights as a parent.”

The anti-trans ad was one of the spots released in July by Protect Women Ohio. Total television and radio spending from One Person One Vote outdid the Yes coalition by $12.4 million to $9.7 million, but its edge was much narrower—$5.9 million to $5.3 million—in the campaign’s final week.

The Protect Women Ohio narrators only mention abortion in one of its ads released in the home stretch. In “Caught,” a narrator says, “The out-of-state groups fighting Issue 1 keep saying it’s just about abortion, but it’s not.” Viewers are then told these groups “want to allow minors to get sex changes without parental consent.”

Enough data exists to convince a Republican political consultant that attacking transgender rights, particularly regarding trans children, will win votes. A Pew Research Center poll last year found 58 percent of American adults support requiring “that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with” and a plurality of 46 percent would “make it illegal for health care professionals to provide someone younger than 18 with medical care for a gender transition.” A USA Today/Suffolk University poll of Ohio voters taken last month found that 70 percent were opposed to trans girls playing on “female sports teams in K-12 schools and universities if they’re taking hormones.” (The latter poll also presciently projected that 57 percent of voters would oppose Issue 1.)

But these views appear to lack sufficient breadth and depth to tip elections. Only 41 percent in the Pew poll “strongly” support keeping trans girls off girls’ teams, and 31 percent “strongly” support banning gender-affirming care for minors. Simultaneously, 64 percent support protecting “transgender individuals from discrimination in jobs, housing, and public spaces such as restaurants and stores.”

The mixed data helps explain the electoral impotence of transgender panic, especially in contrast to the proven saliency of abortion rights.

In 2022, reproductive freedom advocates won six statewide referendums, either enshrining abortion rights or rejecting restrictive measures, and lost none. The victories included the purple and red states of Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Ohio will join that list in November if the Issue 1 vote is any indication.

Abortion rights also propelled Democrats in several tough swing state campaigns. In Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, victorious Democratic Senate candidates emphasized abortion in their ads. Exit polls showed voters ranked abortion the most or second most important issue, with the Democratic nominee romping among such voters. Similarly, exit poll data suggests abortion helped Democrats gut out gubernatorial wins in Arizona and Wisconsin, as does pre-election polling in Kansas (where exit polls were not administered).

Some of those Republicans made losing bets on transgender attacks. For the December 2022 U.S. Senate runoff in Georgia, Republican Herschel Walker campaigned alongside competitive swimmer Riley Gaines, who lobbies against transgender women competing in women’s sports. In Nevada, Adam Laxalt released an ad accusing Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of voting to let “biological boys compete against girls.” Kansas Republicans unsuccessfully tried to rile up voters over Democratic Governor Laura Kelly’s vetoes of bills banning transgender participation in women’s sports.

Also, Michigan Republicans put transgender issues front and center in the 2022 election. The result? Full Democratic control of the governorship and statehouse for the first time since 1984.

The Human Rights Campaign tabulated that Republican candidates and right-wing groups spent over $50 million on anti-transgender ads in the 2022 cycle. Not all of that was spent in competitive races; about $7 million was spent by Florida Senator Marco Rubio in his re-election bid, which he won handily. But Human Rights Campaign flagged a “$4 million radio buy from Stephen Miller’s America First Legal on Black and Spanish-language radio in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.” Despite the under-the-radar attempt to sow discord among the party’s base, including direct mail targeting people of color, Democrats won at least one statewide race in six of these eight states.

After Glenn Youngkin’s 2021 upset gubernatorial victory in Virginia and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s landslide re-election in 2022, Republicans might have thought stoking outrage over supportive policies for transgender students would be a great way to woo suburban parents who drifted from the GOP thanks to Donald Trump. But as I wrote about Youngkin’s campaign, the grinning fleece-wearing dad relied on dog whistles, eschewing blunt ideological appeals, to navigate transgender controversies and stitch together a winning moderate-to-conservative coalition. And while Ron DeSantis won after scoffing at criticism of his law that banned discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity in classrooms, it’s become more evident over the past few months that what plays in Florida doesn’t necessarily play in the rest of the country.

If the failure of transphobic messaging doesn’t convince Republicans to drop their demagoguery, they should consider this: In 2016, Pew found that 30 percent of Americans knew someone who is transgender. In 2022, it was 44 percent. As with gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, personal familiarity with transgender adults—and trans kids—will become even more common. Increased acceptance and understanding will follow as it has before.

Sep 18 2023,Protesters gather outside Milwaukee Planned Parenthood as abortion services resume,CBS 58,center,https://cbs58.com/news/protesters-gather-outside-milwaukee-planned-parenthood-as-abortion-services-resume,"Debate reignited: Protesters decry, supporters celebrate resumption of abortion services in Milwaukee and Madison

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Abortion services resumed in the state of Wisconsin Monday, Sept. 18, after they were paused for nearly 15 months after Roe v. Wade was overturned.

For thousands of women and families, Monday marked the return of critical health care services. But many pro-life supporters are protesting, claiming the abortion services are still illegal.

On Monday morning, more than a dozen pro-life supporters protested outside the Milwaukee Planned Parenthood location on Water Street. More protesters gathered outside the Madison location. Those are the only two locations in the state offering abortion services right now.

""I'm here today to defend a woman's right to health care,"" said pro-choice supporter, Brian.

""In 1849, there was a law in the books in Wisconsin that what they're doing right now, in this building, is totally illegal,"" said Remmy LeBlansc, pro-life supporter.

But legal analysts disagree.

A Dane County judge's July ruling on the state's 1849 feticide law was enough to convince Planned Parenthood to move forward.

President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said, ""The Dane County Circuit Court twice now has made it very clear that the law in question is not applicable to voluntary abortions.""

Atkinson's team acted quickly to lawfully reinstate those services. She said, ""Because it is so needed, there was no reason to wait.""

Appointments at the Water Street location filled up in 24 hours.

""For people to be able to access this really essential care in their backyard. It's critical and it's what people deserve,"" said Atkinson.

But that ruling only reignited the debate.

Pro-life groups like Wisconsin Right to Life say Monday was a setback.

""There's a heaviness knowing that we now are in a Wisconsin where abortion services are being provided, because we know every time there's an abortion, we know a life is lost,"" said Gracie Skogman, legislative director of Wisconsin Right to Life.

Similar scenes played out in Madison.

Matt Sande, the director of legislation for Pro-Life Wisconsin, said, ""We are obviously very sad. This is Black Monday for us.""

But pro-choice supporter Kim said, ""I believe every woman and every person who could become pregnant needs to have that same right to control their own body.""

On Monday evening in Milwaukee, dozens of pro-choice advocates chanted, ""Reproductive rights are here to stay!"" at the steps of the Milwaukee County Courthouse.

They celebrated the resumption of services, but also called for those services to be expanded.

Carly Klein, of the group Reproductive Justice Action Milwaukee, said, ""The efforts of grassroots organizations and nonprofits is really what brought abortion services back to Wisconsin, and the more that we keep applying pressure to politicians and holding them accountable, the more we're going to see positive changes.""

Tanya Atkinson said Planned Parenthood will operate its abortion services under the restrictions that were in place in Wisconsin before the Dobbs decision was delivered. That means abortion is banned at 20 weeks, women are required to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion, and they must have a counseling appointment and a 24-hour waiting period.

Atkinson said Planned Parenthood's number one priority is the health and safety of patients and staff, and she said they have a number of rigorous security measures in place at Planned Parenthood locations to keep people safe.

Skogman said Wisconsin Right to Life will continue its fight.

Nov 10 2023,Abortion opponents threw the kitchen sink at Ohio’s Issue 1 to try to break their losing streak. Voters approved it anyway.,Cleveland Plain Dealer,center,https://cleveland.com/news/2023/11/abortion-opponents-threw-the-kitchen-sink-at-ohios-issue-1-to-try-to-break-their-losing-streak-voters-approved-it-anyway.html,"COLUMBUS, Ohio – National abortion opponents used Ohio as a test market this year as they continued their search for a way to defeat abortion access at the ballot box.

Ahead of Tuesday’s election, they took a scattershot approach to trying to defeat state Issue 1. Like in other states, they first tried to tie the measure to myriad, non-abortion related issues, such as gender identity, parental consent laws and even human trafficking. They largely dropped the claims, determining voters didn’t find them believable.

In a completely new approach for a campaign trying to defeat a state abortion measure, they eventually branched into explicitly reaching out to voters who support abortion rights, arguing Issue 1 went too far while using Gov. Mike DeWine as a grandfatherly spokesperson.

They even tried to bend reality by talking around an unpopular six-week ban on abortion that DeWine signed in January 2019 and that Republican officials have spent a year defending in court. They reasoned the law, which the “yes” campaign centered its campaign around, is not enforced since it’s on hold while the legal challenge plays out.

Nothing worked.

All those ads, and tens of millions of dollars later, voters approved Issue 1 on Tuesday 56%-44%, a margin similar to how the issue polled in November 2022, before the massively expensive campaign played out.

It was the seventh straight state election loss for abortion opponents, who have yet to win at the ballot since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year.

The question for abortion opponents remains: Where do they go from here? The uncertainty lingers ahead of 2024, when similar proposals are expected in other states, including Arizona, Florida and Missouri. And it looms over other races up and down the 2024 ballot, including those that will determine control of Congress and statehouses.

Kyle Kondik, an Ohio native who is a political analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, said there’s no good answer to what he views as a simple problem.

“The Republicans just can’t sugar-coat the fact that they’re on the wrong side of this issue,” Kondik said.

Patrick Brown, a policy fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who personally opposes abortion, said the anti-abortion movement needs to change its approach. That includes accepting compromise and changing how they talk to those in the political center.

“It’s not just a messaging problem. It’s also a substantive problem. And we need to find a sweet spot where we’re doing something that’s meaningful and advancing the pro-life cause while not engendering backlash and leaving ourselves vulnerable to future attacks by pushing laws that are outside of the mainstream,” Brown said.

He also said in Ohio, the “heartbeat” law was a major problem and is far out of the mainstream of what public opinion supports.

“This law was passed in a pre-Dobbs decision era, and I like to think that if the Ohio state legislature had known they would be playing with real bullets, they would have constructed a law that could withstand more public scrutiny,” Brown said. “I think it’s safe to say this bill was not in the bell curve of public opinion.”

Those involved with the campaign to defeat Issue 1, meanwhile, said the answer is more money. In a fundraising appeal to supporters, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser, whose group was an architect of the “no” campaign, said they lost in Ohio because of their financial disadvantage – the pro-Issue 1 campaign raised three times as much money in the final weeks before the election – and because of unfavorable coverage from the media.

“Pro-life and GOP forces must begin preparing for these fights now, most urgently raising the funds necessary to cut through the abortion lobby’s lies and deception, aided significantly by their allies in the media,” Dannenfelser said in the memo, released on Wednesday and obtained by cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer.

Democrats and abortion-rights supporters said voters simply were unconvinced by Issue 1 opponents’ claims.

They said voters approved it despite Republican Ohio officials’ attempts to sabotage the measure. That included scheduling an August vote on a measure that, had it passed, would have blocked the abortion amendment, and by writing ballot language they said attempted to prejudice voters against the measure.

“I think the results show their efforts to confuse voters did not work,” said Veronica Ingham, campaign manager for the pro-Issue 1 group Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights “We saw DeWine try to walk back his stance on this issue because he saw the writing on the wall. It’s very clear that it did not work.”

“They used government websites to spread lies,” said Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a reference to a website run by Ohio Senate Republicans. “They should have known better. And Ohioans saw through it.”

The evolution of the “no” campaign’s claims

The “no” campaign, also organized by Citizens for Christian Virtue, a socially conservative organization in Columbus, began doing something ahead of the November election that veterans of similar campaigns in other states said was new.

They began running ads that specifically reached out to abortion-rights supporters.

The approach was a change of tactics after the approach they used earlier in the year – attempting to tie Issue 1 to other hot-button social issues – failed to persuade voters to approve the measure in August that would have blocked Issue 1 from passing.

Although they never said it publicly, both approaches are a tacit acknowledgment of what Tuesday’s election showed once again: abortion rights are politically popular.

In one prong of their arguments, opponents said that abortion in Ohio would continue to be legal through 22 weeks even if Issue 1 failed. This is technically true – that is, unless state officials were to eventually prevail in a legal challenge to the six-week abortion law. Had Issue 1 not passed, blocking the six-week ban would have required the Republican-controlled Ohio Supreme Court to agree that Ohio’s Constitution, before Issue 1, guaranteed the right to an abortion.

The other argument was that Issue 1 went too far. DeWine and First Lady Fran DeWine made that case in one ad, saying it would allow for abortions late in pregnancy under a broadly written health exemption. The campaign was intentional about using DeWine as a spokesperson. The governor won reelection last year by 25 percentage points, despite the looming abortion issue, after earning many Democratic voters’ trust because of how he handled the coronavirus pandemic.

“I know Ohioans are divided on the issue of abortion,” DeWine said, speaking directly into the camera. “But whether you’re pro-life or pro-choice, Issue 1 is wrong for Ohio.”

In another ad, a woman named Meredith said people on both sides of Issue 1 “weren’t telling the truth.” She said she’s “pro-choice” but like DeWine, said Issue 1 went too far.

Earlier in the campaign, the “no” messaging picked up where an unsuccessful campaign last year in Michigan left off, and ran millions of dollars in negative campaign ads. The anti-Issue 1 campaign reasoned they could define the issue negatively early on in the minds of voters, although that proved not to be the case.

In one ad in March 2023, the anti-Issue 1 group Protect Women Ohio ran ads aimed at parents that said their daughters could be allowed to “change their sex” and that it could happen without their consent if the abortion-rights measure were to pass. The argument stems from language in Issue 1 that offers protections to “reproductive decisions,” which they argued could apply to gender reassignment surgeries and other similar treatments. Legal experts and even Republican Attorney General Dave Yost dismissed this claim as a legal stretch.

Angela Vasquez-Giroux, who worked to help pass the Michigan abortion amendment, said the approach was familiar. Last year, abortion opponents tried to tie the Michigan measure to issues like transgender athletes participating in high school sports, she said.

“It never works,” said Vasquez-Giroux, who’s now the vice-president of communications and research for Reproductive Freedom for All, a national group formerly known as NARAL Pro-Choice America.

“Instead of saying, ‘This is why we think it’s cool to ban abortion,’ they’re distracting and lying and, frankly, it’s horribly disgusting that they would target another vulnerable group of people to try to chip away or create animosity between different groups,” Vasquez-Giroux said.

Veterans of other campaigns took note of the new tactics from the “no” side. But the problem, they said, goes back to the fundamental issue abortion opponents have.

“I think the real problem is their extreme abortion ban is very unpopular with voters,” said Ashley All, who worked on the pro-Issue 1 campaign after helping with other ballot campaigns in Kansas and Michigan.

All the while, abortion opponents ran some lower-visibility ads, including some digitally targeted at specific groups, that made arguments specifically against abortion.

One included audio from a 911 call from workers at a Dayton abortion clinic who called an ambulance after one patient suffered complications, saying Issue 1 would make abortion less safe by overturning state regulations on abortion clinics. Another from an outside group claimed if Issue 1 were in place last year, a Columbus man who raped a 10-year-old girl in a case that brought national attention to Ohio’s “heartbeat” law could have been the one who drove her to Indiana to get an abortion.

And finally, the week before the election, DeWine tried something else.

He said he’d push to add rape and incest exemptions to the six-week abortion ban, the bill DeWine signed himself after pledging to do so during his 2018 campaign. His predecessor, John Kasich, had vetoed similar bills for lacking the exemptions.

‘Yes’ re-runs their playbook

In contrast, the “yes” campaign took an approach honed by six previous victories in other states.

They ran against an unpopular abortion ban, and in the case of Ohio, said Issue 1 would keep the procedure legal. They framed the “heartbeat” law as extreme – at times describing it as lacking an exemption for health of the mother, even though it had one – and used personal stories from people affected when the law was in place for 82 days. They said passing Issue 1 would prevent Republican lawmakers from banning abortion completely, something they had seriously considered before Issue 1 coalesced.

The “yes” campaign also largely avoided talking about which specific laws they might challenge were Issue 1 to pass – although they explicitly said the “heartbeat” law would be overturned, and that Issue 1 had no effect on abortion-related parental consent laws.

In a wrinkle that some pointed out, the Issue 1 campaign here heavily incorporated doctors who had been involved with a grassroots effort that helped push legacy abortion-rights groups to support putting Issue 1 up for a vote in 2023, rather than in 2024, as many initially had wanted.

“Seeing people who are responsible for helping us stay healthy and live our best lives became such an important, action-oriented part of this issue,” said Vasquez-Giroux with Reproductive Freedom for All.

DeWine said Thursday that he thinks Issue 1 passed because the well-financed campaign backing it effectively framed it as a binary choice between the six-week ban and Issue 1. As he argued during the campaign, he said he thinks a “health” exemption in Issue 1′s language will allow for abortions later in pregnancy than what most Ohioans support.

“You compare what you have now, which has no exception for rape or incest, versus what we’re offering,” DeWine said. “And I’m saying they won that debate, because I think the majority of people looked at it that way or another.”

DeWine said it will take some time to evaluate Issue 1′s effects, but he called for future changes to the amendment, which would require another statewide vote, and likely, another high-profile campaign.

He added: “They had two choices, but most people are somewhere in the middle, and I think as we look into the future, that’s a fact.”

While DeWine attributed Issue 1′s failure to the “heartbeat” bill, he also didn’t think he made a mistake by signing it.

“I don’t regret it. One of the things about being governor, it’s a great job but you also take bills as they’re sent to you.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has appointed a pro-abortion activist who resides in another state to Dianne Feinstein's U.S. Senate seat.

In a statement posted Sunday, Newsom's office announced the appointment of Laphonza Butler to fill the U.S. Senate seat that became vacant upon the death of longtime Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., Friday.

Butler, a Democrat, will serve until at least Jan. 3, 2025, when Feinstein's term is scheduled to expire.

Newsom's office touted Butler's role as the president of EMILY's List, an advocacy group that works to elect pro-abortion Democratic women to political office as well as the fact that she is a black lesbian who will become the first openly LGBT person to represent California in the U.S. Senate.

Butler has also served as an advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris and as the president of ""the largest labor union in California – SEIU Local 2015 – a union representing more than 325,000 nursing home and home-care workers throughout the state.""

""An advocate for women and girls, a second-generation fighter for working people, and a trusted adviser to Vice President Harris, Laphonza Butler represents the best of California, and she'll represent us proudly in the United States Senate,"" Newsom said upon announcing Butler as his pick to succeed Feinstein.

""As we mourn the enormous loss of Senator Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for — reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence — have never been under greater assault.""

Newsom vowed, ""Laphonza will carry the baton left by Senator Feinstein, continue to break glass ceilings, and fight for all Californians in Washington D.C.""

In a message posted on X Monday morning, Butler stated that she is honored to accept the nomination ""to be U.S. Senator for a state I have made my home and honored by his trust in me to serve the people of California and this great nation.""

I'm honored to accept Gov. @GavinNewsom's nomination to be U.S. Senator for a state I have made my home and honored by his trust in me to serve the people of California and this great nation. ???? — Laphonza Butler (@LaphonzaB) October 2, 2023

""No one will ever measure up to the legacy of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, but I will do my best to honor her legacy and leadership by committing to work for women and girls, workers and unions, struggling parents and all of California,"" Butler added. ""I am ready to serve.""

Following the news of Butler's appointment, reports surfaced about how Butler resides in Maryland.

Ashley Zavala, the California Capitol correspondent for California-based news outlet KCRA-TV, posted a screenshot on X of Butler's biography on the EMILY's List website as it appeared before her appointment to the Senate and contrasted it with how it appears now.

It appears EMILY’s list has removed the final line in Laphonza Butler’s bio that states she lives in Maryland. pic.twitter.com/6wYYYJEqoE — Ashley Zavala (@ZavalaA) October 2, 2023

The screenshot of Butler's biography before she was appointed includes a sentence reading, ""She lives in Maryland with her partner Neneki Lee and their daughter Nylah.""

The screenshot reflecting the current version of Butler's digital biography shows the sentence has been removed.

Zavala followed up on her initial post by noting that ""Newsom's office confirms she moved to DC area for EMILY's list, but is a CA homeowner and will reregister to vote in California before being sworn in.""

Newsom's selection received pushback from Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a national pro-life grassroots advocacy group.

SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said Butler's appointment is an example of how ""the abortion lobby spends millions to elect Democrats who back its agenda of abortion on demand through all nine months of pregnancy, paid for by taxpayers.""

""Democrats like Newsom, in turn, are beholden to the abortion lobby,"" she maintained. ""The pay-to-play system couldn't be more obvious, with an unelected Senate seat as the ultimate reward. Newsom even passed over staunch pro-abortion candidates who reside in California in favor of a Beltway insider and the biggest pro-abortion extremist he could find.""

Butler's appointment to the U.S. Senate comes as three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives remain in the running to replace Feinstein in next year's regularly scheduled general election, as the senior senator had planned to retire before her death.

One of the candidates in next year's Senate election, Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., had previously expressed disappointment at Newsom's vow to appoint an African American woman to serve as a caretaker that would serve out Feinstein's term in an effort to remain neutral in the ongoing primary race.

Lee said, ""the idea that a Black woman should be appointed only as a caretaker to simply check a box"" is ""insulting to countless Black women across this country who have carried the Democratic Party to victory election after election.""

""[T]here are currently no Black women serving in the Senate,"" Lee said. ""The perspective of Black women in the US Senate is sorely needed — and needed for more than a few months.""

""Governor Newsom knows this, which is why he made the pledge in the first place. If the Governor intends to keep his promise and appoint a Black woman to the Senate, the people of California deserve the best possible person for that job. Not a token appointment,"" she contended."
Apr 04 2023,Utah abortion rights advocates challenge law that would ban abortion clinics in the state,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/utah-abortion-rights-advocates-challenge-law-would-ban-abortion-clinics-state,"A Utah law that would ban abortion clinics has been challenged in state court by abortion rights advocates who argue it effectively prohibits abortion in the deeply conservative state.

While abortions remain legal up to 18 weeks of pregnancy in Utah, the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah and the ACLU of Utah said at a news conference Monday that limiting abortions to licensed hospitals would dramatically reduce access to treatments, as roughly 95% of abortions in Utah are performed at clinics.

""Honestly, there are no realistic alternative locations for Utahns to continue to get this really essential health care,"" said Sarah Stoesz, president-CEO of Utah’s Planned Parenthood affiliate. ""This law wouldn’t just ‘shift care’ to hospitals — as some politicians are cynically maintaining. In fact, it would functionally eliminate access to abortion in Utah, putting the lives and health of people at risk.""

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU’s legal challenge asks the court to delay implementation of the law until courts rule on its legality. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the legislation last month after it cleared the Republican-led statehouse, where supporters argued Utah wouldn't need licenses for abortion clinics when courts rule in their favor and limit abortions to only exceptional and emergency circumstances.

Still, the signing of the law set off a rush of confusion among clinics, hospitals and prospective patients, who were already navigating a raft of overlapping trigger laws and legal challenges in Utah. It's set to take effect May 3, at which time abortion clinics will no longer be able to apply to be licensed. It would institute a full ban on Jan. 1, 2024, by stripping all clinics of their licenses.

Though state officials have said clinic licenses will remain until then, Planned Parenthood attorney Hannah Swanson said ""confusing licensing provisions"" would force clinics to stop providing abortions on May 3, barring court intervention. She said Planned Parenthood was concerned about sections of the 1,446-line bill that it believes makes providing abortion a crime on that date.

UTAH GOVERNOR SIGNS GENDER-AFFIRMING HEALTH CARE BAN, SCHOOL CHOICE BILLS INTO LAW

Republican lawmakers said last month that Planned Parenthood's claims about the legislation were inaccurate. In response to a question about currently licensed clinics, state health officials directed The Associated Press to licensing rules that do not require abortion clinics to pursue new licenses for the time being.

Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, the legislation’s Republican sponsor, said the law was a byproduct of working with doctors and hospitals to ""strike the best balance of protecting innocent life and protecting women who experience rare and dangerous complications during pregnancy.""

The law has wide-ranging implications while the courts sort through legal challenges to other abortion restrictions passed by Utah lawmakers. Last year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning Roe v. Wade triggered two pieces of legislation — passed years ago — which were designed to go into effect should the court roll back the constitutional right to abortion. In 2019, lawmakers passed a ban on abortion after 18 weeks and in 2020, a ban on abortions regardless of trimester, with several exceptions including for instances where maternal health is at risk, as well as in cases where rape or incest is reported to the police.

Utah's Planned Parenthood affiliate sued over the 2020 ban, and in July, a state court delayed its implentation until legal challenges could be resolved. The 18-week ban has since been de facto law, though Stoesz said on Monday that the clinic law would be tantamount to a full ban on abortions should it take effect.

She warned that the state's hospitals weren't designed or equipped to accommodate patients who have sought comparatively affordable care at specialty clinics for decades. The Utah Hospital Association has yet to answer questions on their plans to adapt to the new legal landscape.

Utah's turmoil mirrors developments in Republican strongholds around the country since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and transformed the legal landscape, prompting a raft of lawsuits in at least 21 states.

Planned Parenthood operates three of the state’s four abortion clinics and said it does not plan to discontinue the majority of non-abortion services it provides — including tests and screenings for pregnancy, cancer and sexually transmitted infections.

UTAH GOVERNOR SIGNS ABORTION CLINIC BAN IN LATEST POST-ROE MOVE TO DEFEND 'INNOCENT' AND 'UNBORN'

The new restrictions are most likely to affect those seeking to terminate pregnancies via medication because they account for the majority of abortions in Utah and the nation. Abortion medication is approved for up to 10 weeks of pregnancy and mostly prescribed at clinics though it is increasingly offered via telemedicine, owing to a pandemic-era FDA rule change.

Stoesz said the law was an attack on all kinds of abortion. She said that although she didn't doubt capable providers worked at hospitals, she said that for most who seek it, abortion is a routine part of their medical care and best provided at a specialty clinic, not in a high-cost environment like a hospital.

""An abortion is an abortion. And this law isn’t specific to the way that the abortion occurs,"" she said.

Utah lawmakers have previously noted that the law also clarifies the definition of abortion to address liability concerns about how exceptions are worded in state law — a provision they called a compromise.

Since the law’s passage, both lawmakers and Utah’s Department of Health and Human Services have said abortion clinics could apply for new licenses as hospitals.

""If an abortion clinic meets the requirements of a hospital then they may apply for a hospital license,"" said Charla Haley, a state health department spokesperson, in a statement last month.

However, due to different licensing requirements, doing so could require changes for the state’s four standalone clinics, which primarily provide medication abortion and have relied on clinicians and other practitioners rather than physicians and surgeons to provide abortions."
Oct 24 2023,Georgia high court says abortion ban is legal now even though it was unconstitutional before,Law & Crime,center,https://lawandcrime.com/abortion/georgia-high-court-says-states-abortion-ban-is-legal-now-even-though-it-was-unconstitutional-when-passed,"The highest court in Georgia has revived the state’s six-week abortion ban — despite the fact that when it passed in 2019, it violated the nationwide law of the land under a still-intact Roe v. Wade.

The Peach State’s strict law makes abortions illegal after cardiac activity has been detected in an embryo, typically at around six weeks of pregnancy. The statute was passed in 2019, then struck down as unconstitutional. However, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in a 6-1 decision — with two justices abstaining — that reinvigorated the law known as the LIFE Act.

A riddle of timing

Georgia’s Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act (“LIFE Act”) was signed into law by Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, in 2019. At the time, Roe v. Wade — the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that established a constitutional right to an abortion — was well-settled law. It was not until June 2022 that the Supreme Court overturned Roe with the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

Justice Samuel Alito’s majority opinion in Dobbs pronounced the nearly 50-year-old decision in Roe as “egregiously wrong from the start,” and said that under the current Court’s interpretation, “[t]he Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.” The ruling was a green light for many states’ so-called “trigger laws” banning abortion pending Roe being overturned to go into effect.

Regardless of it being overturned, however, Roe was binding precedent from the time the decision was handed down in 1973 until it was overruled in 2022 — and was controlling law at the time the LIFE Act was enacted.

Under Roe and the pre-Dobbs decisions thereafter, states could not constitutionally enact or enforce laws that would deprive women of their right to terminate a pregnancy during the first trimester. The Georgia LIFE Act, which bans most abortions from as early as six weeks of pregnancy — sometimes with criminal penalties — was a clear violation of Roe’s mandate.

In a ruling that would likely have been no shock to the Georgia legislature, a federal court struck down the LIFE Act in July 2020 — nearly two years before the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs.

So what did the 2022 overruling of Roe mean for the LIFE Act? Would the Georgia legislature need to enact a new version of the law, or would the LIFE Act somehow go back in effect even though it was unconstitutional at the time it was enacted?

The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that despite being dormant for two years, the LIFE Act is now once again valid and enforceable, without the need for any new action by state lawmakers.

Void ab initio

As soon as the LIFE Act was put on Georgia’s books in 2019, litigation to challenge the statute began. A federal court declared it unconstitutional in its entirety and permanently enjoined any enforcement of the law. However, once the Supreme Court overruled Roe in 2022, Georgia appealed and scored an easy win at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. Given that any constitutional protection of the right to abortion had been eradicated, the 11th Circuit resurrected Georgia’s LIFE Act by throwing out the lower court’s order.

Challengers to the law then filed a second lawsuit, this time arguing in Georgia state court that the LIFE Act (H.B. 481) had been “void ab initio” — or “void from inception.” The state court lawsuit did not assert any federally-protected right to abortion, but instead focused on the procedural defects of allowing the LIFE Act to spring back into action.

Plaintiffs argued that the statute should be analyzed against “the legal environment that existed when H.B. 481 was enacted,” not against what happened in Dobbs two years later. Because the law was “unequivocally unconstitutional” when it was adopted, it is void for all time, they said.

“A faulty premise” and the role of the justices

Though it might seem that a statute that was clearly illegal when adopted would be void from the start, the Georgia Supreme Court came to an entirely different conclusion. It ruled that H.B. 481 would not fail for voidness, reasoning that Dobbs did not change the meaning of the Constitution. Rather, it reasoned, the Constitution never meant to confer a right to abortion — and only its interpretation of that has changed.

Justice Verda M. Colvin, the first African American woman judge appointed by a Republican governor to Georgia’s highest court, wrote for the six-member majority and called the idea that the U.S. Supreme Court changed the meaning of the Constitution in Dobbs a “faulty premise.”

Colvin explained that the justices are “not the source of the Constitution’s meaning,” and have no power to amend the Constitution on their own. Rather, the judge elaborated, the Constitution’s meaning was fixed at the time the document was ratified, and the Court only has power to change its interpretation.

Concluding that “the United States Constitution means today what it meant when the LIFE Act was enacted in 2019, even if the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Constitution has changed,” Colvin ruled that any perceived conflict between the LIFE Act and the Constitution in 2019 amounts to no real conflict at all.

Colvin did devote a few paragraphs of the 38-page ruling to acknowledging that Georgia Supreme Court’s ruling “might appear to be an unusual result.”

“Because Roe and its progeny were controlling authority on the meaning of the United States Constitution when the LIFE Act was enacted, one reasonably could have expected at that time that the constitutionality of the LIFE Act would be evaluated under Roe-era precedent,” Colvin sympathized.

Despite that reasonable expectation, Colvin clarified, the Georgia court has no choice but to be “obedien[t]’ and “faithfully apply” Dobbs now, without considering what would have been the outcome under Roe.

Lone dissenter Georgia Supreme Court Justice John Ellington had quite a different take on the resurrection of the formerly-unconstitutional LIFE Act.

“A legislative enactment that is void ab initio, even though any statute it creates or amends may remain ‘on the books,’ cannot spring to life because of any subsequent change in the law, even a constitutional amendment or revision,” Ellington wrote in dissent.

Certainly, Ellington conceded, now that “the Dobbs Court ended any protection under the United States Constitution of a right to terminate a pregnancy before viability,” state legislators may pass laws that would have conflicted with pre-Dobbs federal precedent, but, “[b]ecause the 2019 Act was moribund when enacted, however, the change in doctrine subsequently wrought by the Dobbs decision cannot resuscitate it.”

Ellington also explained that although the legislature could surely pass a new law now, there are good reasons for requiring new legislation, rather than simply reviving an act that has already been invalidated:

As a matter of public policy, requiring re-enactment is healthy for our democracy. It promotes public civic engagement, and it requires our legislators to be responsive to public opinion in light of new precedent and to consider the will of the people when making policy decisions that will profoundly affect them. In this case, the public may have understood, based on well-settled precedent, that the 2019 Act would have been struck down in whole or in part under Roe. The Dobbs decision, however, dramatically changed the post Roe legal landscape. The re-enactment requirement integral to Georgia’s void ab initio doctrine affords its citizens an opportunity to communicate to their elected representatives their preferences in light of such a drastically altered legal landscape.

The future ahead

Monica Simpson, executive director of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a statement that Tuesday’s ruling is “devastating.”

“This abortion ban has forced Georgians to travel across state lines at great expense or continue the life-altering consequences of pregnancy and childbirth against their wills,” Simpson said. “In a state that already has OB/GYN deserts, one of the highest maternal mortality rates, especially for us as Black women, and cruel anti-trans legislation, this decision only further disregards us, our bodily autonomy, and our lives.”

ACLU of Georgia’s executive director, Andrea Young, called for the legislature to take action:

“Today’s ruling is not the end of this fight for women’s healthcare,” Yang said in a statement. “Be clear, the right to abortion is on the ballot in 2024. Gov. Brian Kemp and the Georgia legislature acted to take away our rights. The Georgia legislature can restore our rights and we must organize to elect a pro-choice legislature.

“We are pleased with the court’s decision and will continue to defend the constitutionality of Georgia’s LIFE Act,” Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said in a statement.

The Georgia Supreme Court’s ruling on voidness is not the final word on enforceability of H.B. 481. While opponents of the restrictive statute lost their procedural argument, they still have a substantive basis to challenge the law.

Litigants raised additional challenges to the statute under the Georgia state constitution’s due process and equal protection clauses. Those argument were remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. While state constitutions cannot legally guarantee less protection than the U.S. Constitution, many states guarantee broader protections in their constitutions.

Oct 02 2023,Newsom appoints Maryland-based head of pro-abortion PAC as Feinstein's replacement,The Blaze,right,https://theblaze.com/news/newsom-appoints-maryland-based-head-of-pro-abortion-pac-as-feinsteins-replacement,"A number of California Democrats long had designs on Sen. Dianne Feinstein's Senate seat, including Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter, and Barbara Lee. The decision concerning Feinstein's successor following her death last week was, however, beyond their control, left instead to Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Newsom announced Sunday that Laphonza Butler, the Maryland-based head of the radical pro-abortion political action committee Emily's List and former adviser to failed presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, would warm the seat until the end of Feinstein's term in 2024.

Laphonza's rapid appointment ensures that Democrats will maintain their edge in the Senate and get their way as it pertains to judicial appointments and spending decisions this week. While Republicans hold 49 of the Senate's 100 seats, Democrats hold a majority with their 48 seats, the two independents who caucus with them, and the third independent who frequently votes their way.

Hours after Feinstein's death, the NAACP told Newsom Friday, ""Now the time has come for you to keep your promise.""

Just as President Joe Biden vowed to pick a Supreme Court judge on the basis of her skin color and sex, Newsom's similarly pledged to select a Senate temp on the basis of her immutable characteristics, reported the Guardian.

This is not the first time that race has ostensibly been a deciding factor in a Newsom Senate appointment. When Kamala Harris left her U.S. Senate seat in California to become vice president, Newsom picked his personal friend, former state Secretary of State Alex Padilla, to replace her, reportedly heeding calls to give California its first Latino senator.

Supporters of 77-year-old Rep. Barbara Lee figured she was a shoe-in, having satisfied Newsom's two key criteria this time around.

The Congressional Black Caucus wrote to Newsom Sunday ahead of his decision, stressing that Lee ""is the only person with the courage, the vision, and the record to eradicate poverty, face down the fossil fuel industry, defend our democracy, and tirelessly advance the progressive agenda,” reported Politico.

Rather than Lee, a black California resident, Newsom chose Butler, who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.

According to Anthony York, a spokesman for Newsom, the governor would not demand that Butler stay out of the 2024 Senate race, meaning that Lee, who was trailing Schiff and Porter by double digits in recent polls for the Senate race, could stand to miss out twice on the seat inside a year's time.

""An advocate for women and girls, a second-generation fighter for working people, and a trusted adviser to Vice President Harris, Laphonza Butler represents the best of California, and she'll represent us proudly in the United States Senate,"" Newsom said in a Sunday statement, adding that Butler will ""carry the baton"" in advancing the pro-abortion and gun control agendas in Washington.

After spending nearly two decades at the Service Employees International Union and serving both as a California adviser to Hillary Clinton's failed presidential campaign in 2016 and an a senior adviser to the widely unpopular vice president during her failed 2020 presidential campaign, Butler took the top job at Emily's List in 2021.

Emily's List is a leftist outfit that raises money to support prospective female lawmakers who will support the abortion agenda once in office. The PAC claims to have helped 26 pro-abortion women to the Senate and 175 women to the House.

Upon taking the post at the pro-abortion PAC, Butler claimed that pro-life legislation across the country ""threatens our very democracy"" and is, in combination with imagined ""voter suppression"" efforts, ""part of the decades-long Republican effort to undermine our democracy, disenfranchise people of color, and subvert our elections.""

Butler has made clear she seeks a uniformly Democratic state that guarantees women the legal ability to exterminate their offspring, indicating on X that she is fighting to ""vote out every MAGA extremist and replace them all with a Democratic pro-choice woman.""

Extra to being an exponent of the abortion regime, Butler, a lesbian, is also an outspoken LGBT activist.

Tony Hoang, the executive director of the LGBT activist organization Equality California, said in a statement, ""This historic appointment by Governor Newsom will give our LGBTQ+ community another voice in Congress at a time when our rights and freedoms are under attack across the country. ... We look forward to working with Laphonza as she steps into this new role and continues her lifelong fight for our shared values of equity, freedom, and justice for all.""

State Sen. Scott Wiener — the Democrat who claimed that ""the word groomer is categorically an anti-LGBTQ hate word"" and successfully pushed a law enabling judges to keep men who prey on grade-schoolers 10 years their junior, between the ages of 14 and 17, off sex-offender registries — claimed that Newsom ""elevating a Black lesbian to the U.S. Senate is a powerful statement,"" reported the New York Times.

Aug 09 2023,Ohio vote underscores the power of abortion as spur to polls,Washington Times,right,https://washingtontimes.com/news/2023/aug/9/ohio-vote-underscores-power-abortion-spur-polls,"An Ohio vote rejecting changes to how the state amends its constitution shows that abortion access continues to spur people to the polls, even in red states, and is ringing alarm bells among pro-life groups who want their GOP allies to fight back.

Ohio voters rejected “Issue 1” this week by a 57% to 43% margin. The measure would have required 60% support for voter-driven changes to the state constitution, up from a simple majority.

Republican lawmakers said the move was needed to keep outside interests from meddling in state affairs. But others saw a naked attempt to move the goalposts before a vote in November on whether to enshrine broad abortion rights in the state constitution after Republicans passed a six-week restriction on the procedure.

Voters in Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan opted last year to shore up abortion access after the Supreme Court opened the door to state limits, though Tuesday’s vote in Ohio vote carried extra significance.

The state has been trending red in recent years, and the result showed that even an arcane attempt to change underlying ballot-amendment rules in a lazy-summer election can drive pro-choice forces and their allies to the ballot box.

“Abortion access continues to be a great issue for Democrats, even in a low-turnout election in the middle of August in a red state,” said Darrell West, director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. “People did not want to change the rules in the middle of the game.”

Pro-life groups said their side should view the Ohio vote as a wake-up call. Big-moneyed interests are willing to back an expansion of abortion rights, they said, so it is time to fight back.

“Everyone must take this threat seriously and recognize progressives will win if their opponents are scared into submission by the pro-abortion left,” the Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America said. “So long as the Republicans and their supporters take the ostrich strategy and bury their heads in the sand, they will lose again and again.”

Abortion is legal until 20 weeks into pregnancy in Ohio, while a legal stay is in place against a six-week limit that was approved in the wake of the 2022 Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

Pro-choice groups believe the six-week limit will be upheld, so they are pushing a November measure to allow abortion around 24 weeks into pregnancy, the fetal-viability standard used in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Their constitutional amendment also leaves fetal viability up to the judgment of the pregnant patient’s doctor.

David Pepper, the former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said Tuesday’s vote should give the pro-choice side some momentum as they plot to use the Dobbs decision as a political cudgel against Republicans and former President Donald Trump, who paved the way for the decision by appointing three conservative justices.

“In a way, the Dobbs decision said, ‘Let’s send this back to the people.’ Well, that’s when you should be careful what you wish for,” Mr. Pepper said. “When they do have a chance to weigh in, so far it’s undefeated that — no matter how red or blue or purple a state may be — people want women to have the right to choose.”

President Biden, who could face Mr. Trump in a rematch in 2024, hailed Ohio voters for preserving the status quo on amendment rules.

“This measure was a blatant attempt to weaken voters’ voices and further erode the freedom of women to make their own health care decisions,” Mr. Biden said after Tuesday’s results. “Ohioans spoke loud and clear, and tonight democracy won.”

There might not be a straight line of support from Tuesday’s vote to the abortion-access measure in November. Some Ohioans, especially those in the center-right, might have been put off by the attempt to change the threshold for amendments but espouse pro-life positions.

On the flip side, major cities in Ohio have municipal elections in November, which may increase turnout among liberals who support abortion access.

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican candidate for a U.S. Senate seat, said Tuesday’s loss is “only one battle in a long war.”

“Unfortunately, we were dramatically outspent by dark money billionaires from California to New York, and the giant ‘for sale’ sign still hangs on Ohio’s constitution,” he said.

Mr. LaRose said maintaining the amendment threshold at 50% exposes Ohio to a series of liberal changes beyond abortion, from shutting parents out of their children’s decision on gender-related surgeries to the imposition of new mandates on small businesses.

Mr. Pepper sees it differently. He said the GOP lawmakers’ failed effort reflected the perils of operating in gerrymandered districts.

“They’ve come to the conclusion they are popular when in fact they are benefiting from a pretty rigged system,” Mr. Pepper said. “They’ll never do this, but maybe it’s time to amend your views a little bit to what people actually want.”

Oct 01 2023,Gov. Newsom Picks Top Abortion Activist to Fill Sen. Feinstein's Seat,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/us/gavin-newsom-dianne-feinstein-laphonza-butler/2023/10/01/id/1136587,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom has reportedly wasted no time selecting the replacement for late-Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., picking an abortion activist and chief of a Democrat fundraising beast.

Newsom is planning to appoint Emily's List President Laphonza Butler to the Senate seat, a source told Politico on Sunday night.

The governor is assigned to appoint a replacement for the late sitting senator and the selection is one that has led the Democrat fundraising giant on the issue of abortion.

Newsom's selection is expected to serve through the 2024 election.

Butler is a Democrat strategist and was adviser to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

In choosing Butler, Newsom fulfilled his pledge to appoint a Black woman. However, he had been facing pressure by some Black politicians and advocacy groups to select Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., a prominent Black congresswoman who is already running for the seat.

Butler leads Emily's List, a political organization that supports Democrat women candidates who favor abortion rights.

She also is a former labor leader with SEIU 2015, a powerful force in California politics.

Butler currently lives in Maryland, according to her Emily's List biography.

She did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman in Newsom's office who declined to be named confirmed to The Associated Press that Newsom had chosen Butler.

Democrats control the Senate 51-49, though Feinstein's seat is vacant. A quick appointment by Newsom will give the Democrat caucus more wiggle room on close votes, including nominations that Republicans uniformly oppose. She could be sworn in as early as Tuesday evening when the Senate returns to session.

Feinstein, the oldest member of Congress and the longest-serving woman in the Senate, died at age 90 after a series of illnesses. She said in February she was would not seek reelection in 2024. Lee is one of several prominent Democrats competing for the seat, including California Democrat Reps. Katie Porter and Adam Schiff.

Newsom said he did not want to appoint any of the candidates because it would give them an unfair advantage in the race.

His spokesman Anthony York said the governor did not ask Butler to commit to staying out of the race. Dec. 8 is the deadline for candidates to file for the office.

Butler has never held elected office but has a long track record in California politics. She served as a senior adviser to Harris's 2020 presidential campaign while working at a political firm filled with strategists who have worked for Newsom and many other prominent state Democrats. She also briefly worked in the private sector for Airbnb.

She called Feinstein ""a legendary figure for women in politics and around the country,"" in a statement posted after Feinstein's death.

With the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overrule Roe v. Wade, the abortion issue has become a galvanizing one for many Democrats.

It is not Newsom's first time selecting a U.S. senator, after being tasked with choosing a replacement for Kamala Harris when she was elected vice president; at that time he selected California Secretary of State Alex Padilla for the post. It was one of a string of appointments Newsom made in late 2020 and early 2021, a power that gave him kingmaker status among the state's ambitious Democrats.

The seat is expected to stay in Democrat hands in the 2024 election. Democrats in the liberal-leaning state have not lost a statewide election since 2006, and the party holds a nearly 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans.

Aug 09 2023,What Issue 1’s failure means for abortion in Ohio,NBC 4 WCMH,center,https://nbc4i.com/news/your-local-election-hq/what-issue-1s-failure-means-for-abortion-in-ohio,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) – Millions of Ohio voters cast their ballots Tuesday with an elephant in the voting booth: abortion.

In three months, Ohioans will likely decide whether to enshrine protections for the procedure in the state constitution. With the failure of Issue 1 on Tuesday, the path to a constitutional right to abortion is a little bit clearer – but far from settled.

Ohioans overwhelmingly rejected a Republican-led attempt to enact stricter requirements for constitutional amendments to become law. Instead of the 60% threshold proposed under Issue 1, Ohio retained the simple majority requirement it’s had for 111 years.

A spokesperson for the coalition behind the abortion rights amendment called Issue 1 an attack on Ohio’s democracy.

“Let’s be clear, this attempt to impose an extreme government agenda on Ohioans will not succeed in November,” Rhiannon Carnes with Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights said in a statement. “The voices of Ohioans will never be silenced. Ohioans will now turn their focus to protecting their right to access abortion and to once again rejecting extremism and government control.”

The proposed amendment would assure the right to abortion before the point of fetal viability, as determined by a person’s physician. It prohibits restrictions after that point – about 22 weeks’ gestation – if the life or health of the pregnant person is in jeopardy.

State lawmakers and anti-abortion groups conspicuously tied Issue 1 to blocking the abortion rights amendment. From Secretary of State Frank LaRose declaring to voters that Issue 1 was “100%” about abortion, to pro-Issue 1 commercials making the disproven claim that the amendment would nullify parental consent laws, Issue 1 supporters made it clear that they hope the 60% threshold is too high a hurdle for the abortion amendment to overcome.

Polling on the initiative – and abortion rights in general – shows a majority of Ohioans support access to the procedure prescribed under the amendment, although not at the 60% threshold.

In June, a Scripps News/YouGov poll of 500 Ohioans – not all of whom were registered voters – showed 58% agreed with the amendment’s proposal, while 23% opposed and 20% were undecided.

A month later, a Suffolk University/USA Today poll of 500 likely Ohio voters also found that 58% supported the amendment, while 32% opposed it and 10% were undecided. Days after that, about 54% of Ohioans in an Ohio Northern University poll said they supported the amendment, compared with 30% who opposed and 16% undecided.

The Ohio Northern poll found slightly broader support for abortion access in general – with 60% saying they believe the procedure should be legal.

Before a vote, the court must decide

As the Nov. 7 election inches closer, voters will soon learn whether the abortion amendment will be on their ballots after all.

With two Hamilton County Republicans’ 11th-hour challenge to the amendment, the Ohio Supreme Court has until Monday to decide whether the amendment can proceed as planned. The challenge came days after LaRose certified the amendment’s signatures, clearing what is usually the final test for a citizen-initiated amendment to be proposed to voters.

The complaint claims that the proposed amendment doesn’t include necessary language identifying which statutes or constitutional provisions would be repealed or changed upon its passage.

The challengers assert that three statutes would be overturned should abortion become legal up until a physician determines fetal viability: A law requiring parental consent for minors undergoing the procedure; a law banning abortion if the fetus has or is suspected to have Down Syndrome; and the “Heartbeat Bill,” a ban on abortions after fetal cardiac activity can be detected, around six weeks gestation.

In their merit brief, attorneys for the amendment petitioners contest that proposed amendments don’t require the inclusion of statutory laws that would be repealed, but rather only other constitutional provisions. To meet end-of-August election deadlines required by state law, the state’s highest court has days to decide if the amendment stands.

Another legal battleground

Regardless of the court’s decision in the amendment challenge, the state of Ohio’s abortion laws remains in limbo.

Right now, despite a six-week ban on the books, abortion remains legal through 22 weeks gestation. The so-called “Heartbeat Bill,” which passed in 2019 and contains no exceptions for rape or incest, has been rendered unenforceable while the Ohio Supreme Court ponders whether it violates the state constitution.

A federal court blocked the law from coming into effect months after it was passed. Last June, within hours of the U.S. Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, Attorney General Dave Yost asked the federal court to dissolve the injunction – which it did.

After being rejected by the state supreme court, a handful of abortion clinics successfully requested a temporary restraining order on the law. In September, a Hamilton County judge issued a two-week block on the abortion ban, followed by a preliminary injunction that is now pending before the Ohio Supreme Court.

The state’s highest court accepted a challenge to the preliminary injunction in March. Argument dates have not been set, according to the court docket."

Oct 13 2023,Abortions in North Carolina Drop 31% After Pro-Life Law Takes Effect,Daily Citizen,right,https://dailycitizen.focusonthefamily.com/abortions-in-north-carolina-drop-31-after-pro-life-law-takes-effect,"The number of abortions performed in North Carolina dropped by 31% after a new state law prohibiting abortions after 12 weeks’ gestation took effect.

The Care for Women, Children and Families Act (SB 20) took effect on July 1, 2023, leading to 1,310 fewer abortions performed in North Carolina in July, compared to June, a study has found.

The analysis was performed by the Guttmacher Institute, an anti-life research group that was founded as a part of Planned Parenthood.

In its analysis of previous pro-life state laws, Guttmacher said it found that abortions increased in states that were close to or bordering states that restrict abortion.

However, this did not occur with SB 20. “As abortions dropped significantly in North Carolina in July, there wasn’t a corresponding increase in South Carolina, Virginia, the District of Columbia or Maryland,” The Hill reports.

In addition to limiting most abortions after 12 weeks, SB 20 also:

Bans “partial-birth abortion” as defined by federal law, and prohibits abortions that are sought because of the race or sex of the unborn child or a diagnosis of Down Syndrome;

Requires abortion clinics to be inspected annually and meet the same standards as ambulatory surgical centers;

Makes it unlawful for abortion-inducing drugs to be provided to a pregnant woman by a physician, drug manufacturer or supplier through the mail;

Enacts the “Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act” requiring any health care practitioner present at the time the child is born alive to “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” It also requires that the newborn baby be transported to a nearby hospital for care.

John L. Rustin serves as President of the North Carolina Family Policy Council (NC Family), a Focus-allied state family policy council. In an exclusive statement to the Daily Citizen, Rustin said,

NC Family is extremely grateful for the impact the passage of Senate Bill 20 is having in North Carolina. We know that the lives of precious unborn babies are being saved and vital resources and services are being provided to women and families facing unplanned and crisis pregnancies.

SB 20 was passed by the North Carolina legislature on May 4, 2023. Gov. Roy Cooper proceeded to veto the bill on May 14. However, both the North Carolina House of Representatives and Senate overrode the governor’s veto on May 16.

In testimony before the House and Senate Rules Committee prior to the passage of SB 20, Rustin stated,

This bill … will save thousands of lives every year; it will provide critical support to women and families facing unplanned and crisis pregnancies; it will help to ensure that women are fully informed about abortion procedures and alternatives to abortion especially with respect to chemical abortions; and it will provide $160 million to improve and support adoption, foster care, childcare, and other vital services.

So far, SB 20 has done just that.

After the law was signed, anti-life groups like Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and a North Carolina abortionist sued to block the law.

On September 30, Judge Catherine Eagles ruled to keep the vast majority of the law intact and in place, though she blocked two provisions that (1) require surgical abortions after 12 weeks be performed only in hospitals and (2) require an ultrasound to confirm an intrauterine pregnancy prior to a chemical abortion.

According to NC Family, both provisions of that law were implemented to protect women who have abortions.

“Proponents of the pro-life bill recognize the importance of both of these provisions for the health and safety of the pregnant woman,” NC Family says, adding:

Being in a hospital for an abortion provides the woman with emergency services, blood products, Operating Room suites and rooms for admitted patients in the event of a surgical abortion crisis. Confirmation of an intrauterine pregnancy is critical before a chemical abortion to verify that the pregnancy is not ectopic – a potentially life-threatening event.

Any appeal of Judge Eagles’ ruling will go to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.

We should all be immensely grateful to NC Family, pro-life activists and pro-life legislators in the North Carolina who have worked together to save thousands of preborn babies from abortion.

Please pray that judges will uphold SB 20 upon any appeal that may be filed.

Sep 17 2023,GOP presidential hopefuls talk abortion at evangelical town hall on Saturday,The Daily Iowan,center,https://dailyiowan.com/2023/09/17/gop-presidential-hopefuls-talk-abortion-at-evangelical-town-hall-on-saturday,"Republican presidential hopefuls talked faith and Christianity during the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s fall banquet on Saturday. Evangelical Christians make up 37 percent of Iowa Republicans, according to a Pew Research poll, giving them considerable influence over elections in Iowa.

A gamut of presidential hopefuls made an appearance at the event on Saturday, with 10 GOP hopefuls present at the Iowa Event Center in Des Moines. Over 1,000 people were in attendance and hopefuls answered questions from the organization’s founder and chairman Ralph Reed.

Candidates in attendance included Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, Former U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, Michigan businessman Perry Johnson, former Vice President Mike Pence, Ohio biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Former President Donald Trump, who has endorsed the organization in the past, did not attend the event Saturday night.

Learn more here:

Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds opened the event, touting her achievements as governor including the recent passing of a near-total abortion ban.

“There is simply nothing that compares to the energy and passion of so many faithful patriots all gathered in one place to fight for the values that make this country great,” Reynolds said. “Like our founders, this organization understands … God is the very foundation of our freedom, making us strong, resilient, and confident in the defense of those rights.”

About 25 state and federal representatives also attended the event, including Iowa Republican U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, Zach Nunn, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst.

Each candidate was given about 10 minutes to address a wide span of issues including abortion bans, foreign policy in the Middle East, economic policy, and religious liberty.

Candidates talk abortion policy

The slew of 10 candidates touted their anti-abortion views at the banquet. DeSantis was the first candidate of the night to take the stage, comparing the success of Florida’s anti-abortion policies to Iowa’s.

“Iowa has been able to move the ball with pro-life protections [and] Florida has been able to move the ball,” DeSantis said. “I think the states have done a better job thus far. Congress has really struggled to make a meaningful impact over the years.”

In tears, Johnson expressed his pro-life stance. Johnson said to the Faith and Free Coalition crowd his belief that there is nothing more beautiful in life than an unborn child.

“I believe life begins at conception, so what people have to understand is that there is nothing that is more beautiful in this world than young life,” Johnson said. “The greatest joy in my life are my kids.”

Elder, presidential candidate and host of the radio talk show “The Larry Elder Show,” is very certain about his anti-abortion stance. Elder expressed his approval of crisis pregnancy centers and other support for expecting mothers.

“There are literally thousands of pregnancy centers all over America where women are provided counseling, job training, doctor services, housing, and education,” Elder said. “We are stepping up so people who are so-called crisis pregnancy centers have all kinds of options.”

Pence, who Reed dubbed as the “most pro-life vice president” in the U.S., said his work in Congress laid the foundation for Roe v. Wade to be overturned.

“I want to thank the people of Iowa for the privilege of serving as your vice president,” Pence said to the crowd. “It was the greatest honor of my life to have been a part of the administration that appointed three of the justices that sent Roe vs. Wade in the ash heap of history where it belongs.”

Scott, who previously stated he supported a 20-week federal abortion ban, connected his family values to being a pro-life candidate.

“We need to make sure that we protect adoption in crisis pregnancy centers so that we have the kind of funding for those organizations that protect and promote life,” he said.

Kristi Judkins, executive director of Iowa Right to Life — also in attendance on Saturday — said all of the candidates have represented the pro-life movement well thus far in the caucus cycle.

“We’re not too naive to understand that there are adversaries out there that would disagree with us, but I feel like what I’ve seen from the candidates is they’ve had that kind of non-adversarial kind of approach,” Judkins told The Daily Iowan.

Judkins said although she supports a federal ban on abortion, it’s not the most realistic route for the nominee to take.

“Right now, we stand by states’ rights and that’s what we’ve been working for as part of a

coalition of pro-life leaders,” she said.

Haley stood in contrast with the strong anti-abortion views of the other candidates who took the stage that night.

At the first GOP presidential debate, Haley made it clear she believed federal abortion bans were unrealistic.

“I don’t judge anyone for being pro-choice any more than I want them to judge me for being pro-life,” Haley said on Saturday. “So when we look at this situation, we finally took it from unelected justices and put it back in the hands of the people. That’s where it should be.”

Everyone has a story, Haley said; rather than demonizing women, they should be supported.

“I just want us to have a good conversation on how to save as many babies as we can and support as many moms as we can,” she said."

Aug 08 2023,Proposed Ohio constitutional could determine abortion rights,NewsNation,center,https://newsnationnow.com/politics/abortion/proposed-ohio-constitutional-could-determine-abortion-rights,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Voters in Ohio on Tuesday are weighing whether to make it more difficult to change the state’s constitution, a decision that will have national implications in the debate over the future of abortion rights in the United States.

The proposal on the ballot, known as Issue 1, would raise the threshold for passing future changes to the Ohio Constitution from a simple majority to 60%. That would raise the bar for another election in November, when voters in the state are scheduled to consider a constitutional amendment that would guarantee access to abortion.

With that in mind, voters are turning out in massive numbers for a summer special election. During the early voting period, which ended Sunday, the number of advance ballots cast hit nearly 700,000, more than double the early vote during primary elections in 2018 and 2022, when high profile races for U.S. Senate and governor were on the ballot.

The vote on Tuesday is poised to become the latest referendum on abortion rights since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last year to rescind federal protections for the procedure, creating a state-by-state patchwork of restrictions and bans. Voters in other Republican-leaning states, including Kansas and Kentucky, have responded by protecting abortion access, and the issue helped Democrats limit their losses in last year’s midterm elections.

Ohio could be well positioned to join the list of conservative-leaning states moving to protect access to abortion. AP VoteCast polling last year found that 59% of Ohio voters say abortion should generally be legal.

Out-of-state money has poured into both sides of the contest over the 60% threshold, even as both supporters and opponents say one of their main goals is to keep special interests from having more influence over state policy than average Ohioans.

The campaign in favor of Issue 1, Protect Our Constitution, has told voters that raising the threshold will keep deep-pocketed interest groups from pushing redistricting, gun control and minimum wage policies on Ohio. One Person One Vote, the opposition campaign, argues that raising the threshold for passing future amendments would prioritize the interests of Ohio’s increasingly conservative GOP supermajority at the statehouse over those of everyday voters.

But abortion rights are at the epicenter of the fight, as Ohio and other states have been given control of their own abortion policies following the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last summer. Ohio’s ban on most abortions had been placed on hold under Roe and then allowed to take effect briefly after the court overturned it. Since then, it has been frozen again while a challenge alleging it violates the state constitution plays out.

The abortion amendment would give individuals the right to make their own reproductive health care decisions, including on contraception, fertility treatment, abortion and miscarriage care, until a fetus is viable outside the womb.

At the same time, a broad bipartisan coalition opposes Issue 1 for other reasons. Former Ohio governors and attorneys general of both parties have come out against the constitutional change, calling it poor public policy. If passed it would reverse 111 years of direct democracy that has the potential to affect future citizen-led ballot efforts.

Protect Women Ohio, the campaign against the fall abortion question, has spent millions on the August election — airing ads suggesting the measure not only codifies abortion, but could pressure children into receiving gender-affirming care and undercut parental rights.

Several legal experts have said there is no language in the amendment supporting the ads’ claims, but it follows a pattern through this election cycle of misinformation and fear-mongering being used to sway voters.

Issue 1 opponents have aired ads and mobilized a large coalition, including voting rights, labor, faith and community groups, as well as the state Democratic Party.

It was because of chronically low turnout that lawmakers voted just last year to scrap summer elections, prompting an unsuccessful lawsuit alleging this year’s August special election violated the new law and calling further into question if it was brought back solely to thwart abortion rights for Ohioans.

Aug 09 2023,Ohio Vote Shows Abortion’s Potency to Reshape Elections,New York Times (News),left,https://nytimes.com/2023/08/09/us/politics/ohio-election-abortion-voters.html,"Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, argued that Tuesday’s vote over how to amend the State Constitution was about protecting the state from a flood of special interest money. Secretary of State Frank LaRose, another Republican, urged voters to protect the “very foundational rules” of their constitution.

But Ohio voters clearly didn’t buy it. About three million of them showed up for a vote dominated by the debate over abortion rights — an issue that was not technically on the ballot, but was the undeniable force that transformed what would have normally been a little-noticed election over an arcane legislative proposal into a national event.

For decades, a majority of Americans supported some form of legalized abortion. But the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade has shifted the political intensity on the issue, reshaping a once mostly silent coalition of liberal, swing and moderate Republican voters into a political force. It’s a force Democrats are working hard to harness in elections across the country next year, often with ballot measures, and it’s a power Republicans have yet to figure out how to match, or at least manage.

“We’ve taken it on the chin since Dobbs,” said Michael Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life in Columbus, Ohio, who helped organize efforts supporting the proposal on Tuesday. “One of the things we learned was to get out in front and get out ahead and don’t wait because you’ll be run over by the train.”"
Aug 07 2023,Surging election energy in Ohio will decide fate of abortion,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/ohio-issue-1-constitution-abortion,"Voters in Ohio are energized about the special election on Tuesday to increase the difficulty of amending the state constitution, which will have significant implications for the fate of abortion in the Buckeye State this November.

“It feels like the energy of a month before a presidential campaign in the state of Ohio,” said Michelle Ashley, the lead field organizer in Ohio for the anti-abortion interest group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

UP FOR DEBATE: TRUMP, DESANTIS, AND 2024 GOP HOPEFULS’ STANCE ON SPENDING AND DEBT

Ashley and Amy Natoce of Protect Women Ohio told the Washington Examiner that voters of all walks of life are invested in Tuesday’s vote on Issue 1, which would raise the required majority to pass a constitutional amendment to 60% of a popular vote.

Issue 1 will have a direct effect on the amendment on the ballot in the November election to enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution.

Strongly backed by the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood, the amendment prohibits the state from acting in a way that would, “directly or indirectly, burden, penalize, prohibit, interfere with, or discriminate against” individual exercise or assistance in obtaining abortion and contraception access. Although the amendment allows the state legislature to regulate abortion after fetal viability, the amendment still allows a physician to determine that an abortion is in the best health interest of the mother.

Although the abortion battle is what has launched Ohio into the spotlight in recent weeks, most Ohioans are focused on how Issue 1 will affect the trajectory of their state constitution.

“Ohioans, like any state, they’re proud, and they want to … feel that we’re directing the future of the state, not some outside groups who want to impose their will,” Ashley said.

With Ohio being the leading state for early and mail-in voting options, nearly 580,000 Ohioans have already cast their ballots in the contentious election. Nearly 400,000 people have shown up for early in-person voting at polling places across the state.

Sharon Bronson of Cincinnati, who is an Issue 1 canvasser and a volunteer at her local polling location, told the Washington Examiner that there has “been a steady stream of people coming in. Sometimes there have been lines, so people are exercising their right to vote early.”

Ohio is only one of 18 states that allow for citizen-petition amendments to the state constitution. Only half of those states do not require more than a 50% majority to certify an amendment.

Nactoce told the Washington Examiner that the color and interpersonal dynamics in Ohio have been the most important pieces of the puzzle left out of the plethora of coverage on the election.

“The grassroots energy has been phenomenal,” said Natoce, describing the pop-up rallies that are unaffiliated with interest groups in the state. “There’s just been this really big groundswell of support.”

“What I’m seeing is people that weren’t engaged in the political process before, whether for the pro-life movement or otherwise, now are getting off the bench and onto the field,” Ashley said. “I’ve never seen so much unity … among people for an issue and just ‘how can I help’?”

Canvassers have also witnessed the same enthusiasm.

“When I’m out canvassing, there are high schoolers out canvassing, there are college students out canvassing. That is really, really encouraging because any movement that’s going to last, you’ve got to have a strong young base,” Bronson said.

“It is very interesting to see all the different ages that are all concerned about this,” said Sophia Foisy of Columbus. “It’s been really overwhelming.”

Voters have told Ashley that increasing the difficulty of amending the Ohio Constitution “is just common sense.”

“[The] states’ founding document should not be so easy to amend,” Ashley said. “There are other avenues, and when you feel like groups … can’t get things done through the legislative process [and say] we’re going to circumvent that … it’s really disturbing to many Ohioans.”

In-person Election Day voting in Ohio starts at 6:30 a.m. on Tuesday and closes at 7:30 p.m."
Nov 01 2023,"Appeals Court Rules State Abortion Ballot Language Using ‘Right To Life,’ ‘Unborn Child’ Is ‘Argumentative’",The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/11/01/appeals-court-missouri-abortion-ballot-language,"The Missouri Western District Court of Appeals upheld a decision on Tuesday that declared Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft used “argumentative” and “partisan” language in a ballot description of a proposed abortion amendment, court documents showed.

A Missouri judge determined in September that Ashcroft’s use of phrases such as “right to life,” “unborn child” and “dangerous, unregulated, and unrestricted abortions” were “problematic,” and rewrote the secretary’s summary to include approved language. The Court of Appeals agreed that Ashcroft tried to “mislead” voters with “insufficient and unfair” language, but said the rewritten ballot summaries must specifically mention abortion to accurately describe the proposed amendment, according to court documents. (RELATED: Court Rules Term ‘Unborn Child’ Can Remain On Abortion Ballot Measure)

“The circuit court did not err in determining that the Secretary’s language in this bullet point is not fair and sufficient,” the court wrote in its opinion. “First, ‘right to life’ is a partisan political phrase in the same manner that ‘right to choose’ is a partisan political phrase … The use of the term ‘right to life’ is simply not an impartial term.”

The people of Missouri must have the truth on any ballot summary. The ACLU and Planned Parenthood cannot lie about what this referendum does! https://t.co/NeooSgKAaL — Jay Ashcroft (@JayAshcroftMO) October 31, 2023

Ashcroft plans to appeal the decision and intends to continue advocating for his original summary language, according to a press release from his office. The secretary claimed that the court’s ruling “continued to gloss over the issue” of abortion.

“Once again Missouri courts refused to allow the truth to be known,” Ashcroft said in the press release. “The Western District essentially approved the language that was entirely rewritten by Judge Beetem. Not only is the language misleading but it is categorically false.”

The proposed amendment would prevent Missouri from banning abortion before an unborn child reached 24 weeks and would enshrine “a person’s fundamental right to reproductive freedom” in the state’s constitution, according to the ruling. Once the wording becomes official, supporters will need to collect 170,000 signatures in at least six of Missouri’s eight congressional districts to put the measure up for voting, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.

Ashcroft’s office declined to comment further on the matter."
Sep 15 2023,"Doctors to Resume Abortion Care in Wisconsin, but the Fight for Reproductive Freedom Goes On",Up North News Wisconsin,left,https://upnorthnewswi.com/2023/09/15/doctors-to-resume-abortion-care-in-wisconsin-but-the-fight-for-reproductive-freedom-goes-on,"Planned Parenthood is resuming services at two clinics after a judge interpreted an 1849 law as not being an abortion ban.

Doctors at two Planned Parenthood clinics in Madison and Milwaukee will once again begin providing abortion care on Monday, according to an announcement made Thursday morning by the organization. The announcement came after a Wisconsin judge declared that the arcane language in an 1849 state law does not apply to abortion care.

Planned Parenthood ended all of its abortion services in Wisconsin in the wake of the June 2022 Dobbs decision by the US Supreme Court that repealed Roe v. Wade and the reproductive rights it had guaranteed for 49 years. The organization and other clinics feared that providing abortion care would run afoul of Wisconsin’s 1849 law, which Republicans claim bans abortion in virtually all cases.

But following Dane County Circuit Judge Diane Schlipper’s motions ruling in July, healthcare rights advocates are optimistic that the lawsuit will eventually end with affirmation of Schlipper’s interpretation—that the arcane language in the law applies to the killing of fetuses by assaulting or battering the mother, but not to abortion.

If that is the case, a 1985 state law will take precedence. The “Abortion Prevention and Family Responsibility Act” allows pre-viability abortions as well as post-viability abortions “if the abortion is necessary to preserve the life or health of the woman, as determined by reasonable medical judgment of the woman’s attending physician.”

Viability refers to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb; it is generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks.

Dr. Kristin Lyerly, an obstetrician-gynecologist and one of the intervenor plaintiffs in the legal challenge, said Friday on UpNorthNews Radio that while the resumption of abortion care is a positive development, there’s more to be done to fully restore women’s healthcare rights post-Dobbs.

“Nobody wants a politician making their personal health care decisions for them, whether we’re talking about when you get your preventive care screening or whether you get cancer treatment,” Lyerly said.

Lyerly noted women in Wisconsin’s rural areas still live in healthcare deserts that force them to travel hours for some vital reproductive health services. The solution, Lyerly said, is to continue the fight to get politicians out of intimate, sometimes heartbreaking healthcare decisions.

“Politicians have no right to be in the exam room with you,” Lyerly said. “So let’s continue to help them move out so that we as individuals, as Wisconsinites, can make our own personal health care decisions with the counsel of our medical professionals, our family, our faith leaders, the people who we really trust and rely on.”

Whenever Schlipper issues a final judgment on the interpretation of the 1849 law, an appeals process will almost certainly take the case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which had been controlled by conservative justices for more than 15 years until last month’s swearing-in of Justice Janet Protasiewicz, giving liberals a 4-3 majority.

Protasiewicz repeatedly stated during her campaign this spring that she personally believed abortion should be legal, though she stopped short of saying how she would rule on the specifics of any given case that came before the court.

Gov. Tony Evers praised the Planned Parenthood decision to resume abortion care services in Wisconsin and, like Lyerly, also cautioned there is more to be done to restore women’s healthcare rights.

“I will keep fighting like hell every day until Wisconsinites have the right to make their own healthcare decisions without interference from politicians who don’t know anything about their lives,” Evers said."
Aug 07 2023,Abortion Drives Ohio Election on Amending the State Constitution,New York Times (News),left,https://nytimes.com/2023/08/07/us/ohio-special-election-legislature.html,"For more than a century, Ohio voters have been able to amend the State Constitution with a simple majority vote.

That could end on Tuesday, because the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature has called for a special election that would raise the bar for amendments from a simple majority to 60 percent of the vote.

The reason is no secret. Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year, voters across the country, in multiple elections, have approved ballot measures protecting the right to abortion. A similar election has been scheduled for November in Ohio, and legislators are hoping the higher bar for passing amendments will lead to its defeat."
Sep 14 2023,Wisconsin Catholic Conference: Statement on planned parenthood resuming abortion - WisPolitics,Wis Politics,center,https://wispolitics.com/2023/wisconsin-catholic-conference-statement-on-planned-parenthood-resuming-abortion,"The Wisconsin Catholic Conference, the public policy voice of Wisconsin’s bishops, expresses its deep sadness and dismay that Planned Parenthood plans to resume abortions in Wisconsin. In 1849, Wisconsin banned abortion and in 1853, it abolished the death penalty. Our state was truly ahead of its time in recognizing the value of every human life and opposing state-sanctioned violence. Planned Parenthood’s decision is not a step forward, but a real step backward for human rights.

It bears repeating that taking a human life is not health care, for it is neither healthy nor caring. Abortion is seen as a quick solution to human problems. However, as Pope Francis has written, “It is not ‘progressive’ to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life” (Evangelii Gaudium, 214). Every human being is unique, whole, and sacred, and therefore every human being deserves the right to live.

At the same time, an unexpected pregnancy can present real and significant challenges. Just as every child deserves protection, every woman deserves access to resources and community support throughout her pregnancy and in the years to come. Every woman deserves high-quality prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care, maternity leave, childcare, and other necessary supports for her and her family.

The Catholic Church stands ready and willing to walk alongside women experiencing challenges during pregnancy and parenthood. The Church’s initiative, Walking With Moms in Need, seeks to ensure that no woman is alone when faced with such challenges. If you or someone you know is in need, please reach out to a local parish or Catholic Charities. Pregnancy resource centers are also an invaluable source of support and can be found across Wisconsin.

Legislatively, the WCC will continue to advocate for expanding postpartum care, reducing costs for birth, removing sales tax on feminine hygiene products and baby supplies, funding for pregnancy resource centers, adoption tax credits, and more. The Embrace Them Both bill package, which will receive a public hearing in the Senate on Tuesday, September 19, is a significant step forward. The WCC is ready to work with all legislators on additional legislation to support both mother and child. True justice protects the rights of both women and children, rather than pitting them against each other. We all can and must do better."
Oct 12 2023,She Sued Her State For Denying Her a Abortion. Now She's Running for Office.,Time Magazine,left,https://time.com/6320148/allie-phillips-abortion-lawsuit-tennessee,"Allie Phillips never wanted to be a politician, but she had always wanted to be a mom of two. Whenever Phillips asked her 5-year-old daughter, Adalie, what she wanted to be when she grew up, Adalie would say, ""A big sister."" So when Phillips found out she was pregnant again in Nov. 2022, Adalie was thrilled. ""Her eyes got big and her jaw just dropped open,"" Phillips recalled. ""Every night after that, she sang Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star to my belly. She’d kiss my belly every night before bed."" Phillips and her husband planned to name the new baby Miley Rose.

But at a routine anatomy scan when she was around 19 weeks pregnant, doctors told Phillips that the fetus had significant problems with its kidney, stomach, bladder, heart, lungs, and brain. These conditions were ""not compatible with life outside the womb,"" a doctor told Phillips. Miley Rose would likely die before birth, and the longer Phillips stayed pregnant, the worse her own health could become.

But Phillips, who lives in north Tennessee, could not get an abortion in her home state. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Tennessee enacted one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation, leaving only the most narrow exception for emergency medical situations. In February, Phillips and her husband had to travel almost 1,000 miles to get an abortion in New York City.

Shortly after she returned, Phillips was approached by the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing patients in multiple states who were denied medically necessary abortions. The lawsuit seeks to ensure that pregnant patients can access abortion when their own health is at risk, and to give doctors clarity on which ""medical emergencies"" are exempted from state abortion bans.

More From TIME

Phillips also met with her state representative, Republican Jeff Burkhart, to tell him her story. She wanted to ask for his help writing Miley's Law, which she hoped would expand abortion options for parents when a fetus is diagnosed with severe anomalies. When Phillips told him about her pregnancy loss and mentioned her older daughter, ""He said, 'I thought women could only have a miscarriage in their first pregnancy,'"" Phillips recalls. ""The lack of knowledge, the lack of education, is astounding.""

That's when she began to think about running for his seat.

Phillips is a bubbly 28-year old with a halo of golden curls and a TikTok account dedicated to her journey with pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and abortion-rights advocacy. She became a single mom to Adalie when she was 22. Three years later, she married her husband, Bryan Lynch, an old high-school flame. She runs a daycare center out of her home. ""Being a single parent, daycares were expensive and hard to find,"" she explains. ""I wanted to help other moms in my community by not charging as much.""

Phillips and her husband planned to try for another baby as soon as they could afford a bigger home. In the summer of 2022, it was finally time. ""We got married, we got our house, and we were about to expand our family,"" Phillips says. The pregnancy seemed to be progressing smoothly until the anatomy scan. Adalie wanted to see her baby sister, so the couple decided to make the routine scan in February a ""family affair,"" Phillips recalls.

As soon as the ultrasound began, Phillips could sense that ""the emotion in the room was kind of off."" About five minutes in, the technician stopped the exam and told Phillips that she needed to talk to her doctor.

""Is everything okay?"" Phillips asked.

""I saw some things that are concerning,"" the technician replied. Phillips's stomach dropped.

The doctor came in and told the family that the scan had detected multiple fetal abnormalities. The doctor urged Phillips to see a high-risk maternal-fetal medicine specialist. Four days later, after a second ultrasound, that specialist told Phillips that Miley Rose's kidneys, stomach, and bladder weren't functioning. Her heart had only two working chambers, and her lungs had not developed at all. Worst of all, the fetus's brain had semilobar holoprosencephaly, which meant the brain had not properly split into two hemispheres.

""While she was talking about everything that was wrong, I was thinking, ‘She could get a heart transplant, she could get a kidney transplant, this is fixable,’"" Phillips recalls. ""But then she got to the brain and I thought, ‘Oh no.'""

The doctor informed the family that Miley Rose was highly likely to die in utero. If she did make it to birth—fetuses with semilobar holoprocencephily have only a 3% chance of making it to delivery—she would die shortly after. The doctor also told Phillips that the longer she stayed pregnant, the higher her own risk of health complications, especially because her condition was already delicate because of a gastric sleeve that had been installed before her pregnancy.

But by that point, in Feb. 2023, abortion was outlawed in Tennessee. Doctors who performed abortions had to provide ""affirmative defense,"" meaning that the burden was on the physician to prove that the abortion was necessary to save the patient's life. Phillips had two options: she could continue her pregnancy and put her own health at significant risk, or she could travel out of state to terminate it.

Phillips explained to Adalie that she wouldn't get to meet her little sister. She went to a 3D ultrasound clinic, and got Miley Rose's heartbeat recorded in a little teddy bear. Then she and her mom started looking up out-of-state clinics where she could get an abortion.

The cheapest option was in New York City. The procedure cost $1,100, the flights cost $650, and hotels were expensive. But Phillips, who had shared the details of her pregnancy and then the news of the fetal abnormalities on TikTok, received an outpouring of support from her followers, who raised money for her procedure and offered her a place to stay in the city. ""I've always wanted to go to NYC,"" she says. ""But I didn't want to go for this reason.""

After she arrived at the clinic, Phillips underwent another ultrasound. That's when she was told that Miley Rose's heartbeat had already stopped. Phillips went into the hallway, sat down on the floor by the elevators, and cried.

When she was called back in to see the doctor, he explained that since the last recorded fetal heartbeat was over a week earlier, she was at serious risk of blood clots, infections, or sepsis. They had planned to do the abortion the following day, but it was too risky to wait. ""It happened so fast, I didn't have a moment to breathe,"" Phillips says.

After she woke up from the procedure, a nurse asked her if she was okay. ""I said, ‘So I'm not pregnant anymore?’"" Phillips recalls. ""And she said, ‘Ma'am, you're not.’""

Losing Miley Rose was hard enough. But the more Phillips thought about it, the more enraged she became. Not at the loss of her daughter, but at the Tennessee abortion restrictions that forced her to travel out of state for a procedure she needed to protect her own health.

Phillips' story had gone viral on social media as she shared details about her ordeal. In late March, the Center for Reproductive Rights reached out to her over Instagram, asking if she would join a multi-state lawsuit challenging state bans that prohibit medically necessary abortions. ""It felt like a no-brainer,"" Phillips recalls. ""The whole point of me sharing my story was to open new doors, and this was a door.""

In March, the Center for Reproductive Rights filed suit against the state of Texas. In September they filed additional lawsuits against Tennessee and Idaho. The suits were brought on behalf of 20 women denied abortion care across all three states, as well as doctors and medical associations. The goal, says the plaintiffs, is to clarify the ""medical emergency"" exceptions to abortion bans in order to protect patients' access to abortion during dangerous medical situations, and to ensure that the law allows doctors to treat their patients without fear of prosecution.

In April, Tennessee changed its abortion law to allow doctors to use ""reasonable medical judgement"" to provide abortions to prevent ""death... or to prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."" But the Center for Reproductive Rights argues that the way the law is currently written is ""not a meaningful exception,"" says Linda Goldstein, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights and the lead attorney on the Tennessee case.

""Using 'reasonable medical judgement' means that the doctors can be second-guessed. If the prosecutor brings a case and hires a medical expert, the medical expert could say ‘Oh, that wasn’t reasonable,’"" says Goldstein. ""Doctors are at risk of going to jail and losing their license."" Abortion remains a felony in the state, with doctors at risk of being sentenced to three to 15 years in prison if convicted.

In Tennessee, the Center for Reproductive Rights is asking a court to clarify that the state's medical exception must permit doctors to use their ""good faith judgement"" to provide abortions when pregnancy poses a risk to the patient's health, including their future fertility, or when the fetus is unlikely to survive. The suit also asks the court to affirm that pregnant patients have a right to life and health under the state constitution, and that the equal protection clause guarantees the right to an abortion when the pregnant person has a medical condition that poses a risk to their health. The goal, says Goldstein, is to ""to clarify that women don't forfeit their right to life or health when they get pregnant.""

As Phillips was in the process of joining the lawsuit, she asked for a meeting with her state representative, Burkhart. She visited him in June and asked for his help writing Miley's Law. Phillips asked Burkhart if he had a daughter. ""If she called you and told you she had a fetus incompatible with life, and her life were at risk, what would you tell her to do?’"" she recalls asking him. ""He said, ‘The way I grew up, I’d tell her to continue the pregnancy.’""

Phillips says that Burkhart spend the majority of their meeting arguing with her about how ""high risk"" she would have to be to need an abortion. (Burkhart did not respond to multiple requests for comment; his office declined to comment on Phillips' recollection of their conversation, and did not respond to a detailed list of questions.)

Phillips knew that Burkhart, who is in his first term representing a new state House district in north Tennessee, had run unopposed in 2022. ""I thought, ‘Somebody needs to step up,'"" she says. Her mother suggested she run for the seat. Then two friends told her the same. Soon she started hearing from people in the Montgomery County Democratic Party, which she had joined shortly after returning from New York.

If Montgomery County had been deep red, Phillips might have passed on the idea. But she thought victory was possible. Burkhart had won his seat in 2022 with fewer than 7,000 votes, and no opponent. If she could knock on 15,000 doors, she thought, maybe she could beat him.

It may be an uphill battle. Trump won Montgomery County by double digits in 2020. But abortion bans have reshuffled political dynamics around the country, including in conservative areas. ""Her campaign is already off to a strong start because she has such a clear rationale for running,"" says Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, an organization which recruits and trains progressive millennials to run for state and local office. (The group is not yet working with Phillips.) ""I think she is the first but not the last of candidates who tried to get abortion care, especially since this is the first cycle where people will have had to newly navigate bans in many states.""

For Phillips, running for office doesn't ease the pain of losing Miley Rose. But it does give her a sense of purpose. ""I’m gonna take my trauma, I'm gonna take the loss of my daughter, and I’m gonna turn it into something good,"" she said. ""The more I’m able to share my and Miley’s story, the more I’m likely to make positive change."""
Sep 28 2023,Woman who burned Wyoming’s only full-service abortion clinic to be sentenced,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/woman-who-burned-wyomings-only-full-service-abortion-clinic-sentenced,"In 2022, Lorna Roxanne Green set fire to a building slated to become Wyoming’s only full-service abortion clinic.

The 22-year-old college student is scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 28, 2023, and may face up to two decades behind bars.

Green, who reportedly opposed abortion, said she regretted setting fire to the Wellspring Health Access facility in Casper

A woman who says anxiety and nightmares led her to set fire to Wyoming's only full-service abortion clinic, setting back the facility's opening almost a year, is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday.

Lorna Roxanne Green could be sentenced to 20 years in prison for burning the Wellspring Health Access facility in Casper. She pleaded guilty to a federal arson charge in July.

Green said at that hearing she regretted what she did and took full responsibility.

WYOMING ABORTION CLINIC ARSON SUSPECT SEEN ON NEW VIDEO CARRYING GASOLINE INSIDE BEFORE FIRE

""I knew right after"" setting fire to the clinic that it was wrong, she told U.S. District Judge Alan Johnson.

The May 2022 fire happened weeks before the clinic was to open. Extensive damage to the building being remodeled for the clinic kept it from opening for almost a year.

Green admitted to breaking in, pouring gasoline around the inside of the building and lighting it on fire, according to court documents.

The Casper College mechanical engineering student showed no sign of anti-abortion views on social media but told investigators she opposed abortion.

She told a U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent she bought gas cans and aluminum pans the day before the fire, drove to Casper, and carried the cans and pans to the clinic in a bag, matching security video and a witness account, according to a court filing.

She admitted using a rock to break glass in a door to enter and pouring gasoline into the pans in several rooms and on the floor before lighting it, according to the document.

WYOMING WOMAN ACCUSED OF SETTING FIRE TO STATE'S ONLY FULL-SERVICE ABORTION CLINIC ENTERING PLEA

Investigators said they made little progress finding who started the fire until a reward was increased to $15,000 in March, leading several tipsters to identify Green.

The clinic, which opened in April, provides surgical and pill abortions, making it the first of its kind in the state in at least a decade. Only one other clinic in Wyoming — in Jackson, some 250 miles away — provides abortions, and only by pill.

Laws passed in Wyoming in 2022 and 2023 sought to make abortion in the state illegal but a judge has kept abortion legal while a lawsuit challenging the new laws proceeds. One of the new Wyoming laws to ban any drug used to cause an abortion would be the nation's first explicit ban on abortion pills.

Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has expressed sympathy with arguments that a 2012 state constitutional amendment guaranteeing Wyoming residents’ right to make their own health care decisions conflicted with the bans.

Though abortion in Wyoming has remained legal, women in the rural state often go to nearby states, including Colorado, for abortions."
Jul 06 2023,Iowa Legislature called into session to restrict abortion,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/jul/06/iowa-legislature-called-into-session-to-restrict,"DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds on Wednesday called a special legislative session to pursue new abortion restrictions after the state Supreme Court declined to reinstate a 2018 ban after about six weeks of pregnancy.

The court was split 3-3 last month and did not issue a decision on the merits of the law, leaving open the possibility that the GOP-controlled Legislature would try to pass a similar ban. In the meantime, abortion remains legal in Iowa up to 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Lawmakers will meet on July 11.

""Iowans deserve to have their legislative body address the issue of abortion expeditiously and all unborn children deserve to have their lives protected by the government as the fetal heartbeat law did,"" Reynolds wrote in the order.

The blocked law banned abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, which is usually around six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant. Medical experts say the cardiac activity is not an actual heartbeat but rather an initial flutter of electric movement within cells in an embryo.

Democrats in the Legislature immediately issued statements denouncing the expected restrictions as at odds with the majority of Iowa residents. Polling shows most U.S. adults, including Iowans, support at least some access to abortion in general, even as views on the issue are complicated. Few say abortion should be illegal in all cases."
Aug 03 2023,Idaho abortion ban faces unusual legal challenge,World Magazine,right,https://wng.org/podcasts/idaho-abortion-ban-faces-unusual-legal-challenge-1691023015,"MYRNA BROWN, HOST: Coming up next on The World and Everything in It:

Legal battles over abortion trafficking bans.

Those are laws that criminalize transporting a minor across state lines to get an abortion without parental consent.

Idaho has been a trailblazer to pass a variety of pro-life protections like that.

MARY REICHARD, HOST: But on Monday, a judge in Idaho upheld the right ofin-state medical providers to refer patients…including pregnant minors…to out-of-state abortionists. That ruling undermines the state’s abortion ban.

Lawsuits filed last month challenging the trafficking ban put the courts in position to decide the fate of the law.

BROWN: What does this mean for abortion in Idaho, and across the country?

Reporting producer Lillian Hamman has the story.

LILLIAN HAMMAN: The end of Roe v. Wade last year raised all kinds of questions about the future of abortion in America. Two of those questions are “How are women and girls in pro-life states getting abortions elsewhere?” and “who is helping them get there?”

The state of Idaho finds itself at the forefront in responding to those questions. Bordered by pro-abortion states like Oregon, Washington, and California, Idaho boasts a strong abortion ban with exceptions for rape, incest, and health of the mother. On April 5th, Republican Governor Brad Little signed another abortion ban into law, that’s the first of its kind in the nation. Audio here from MSNBC.

MSNBC: A new Idaho law makes it illegal for an adult to help a minor get an abortion without parental consent. It's called the abortion trafficking law…it can mean 2 to 5 years in prison if anyone is convicted

Then, in July, Attorney Lourdes Motsumoto and a coalition of advocacy groups filed a lawsuit against Idaho’s abortion trafficking ban. They claim it violates constitutional speech and travel rights. Adults are forbidden from talking to minors about abortion and can be prosecuted for transporting minors for out-of-state abortions without parental consent. Here’s Idaho House minority leader Ilana Rubel speaking to KTVB-7 after the lawsuit was filed.

RUBEL: Just because the Supreme Court said you can ban abortion does not mean they get to throw the First Amendment out the window and the Fifth Amendment out the window and the 14th Amendment out the window.

Plaintiff Motsumoto also claims the language of the law is too vague to interpret responsibly.

MOTSUMOTO: It's not exactly clear on what you can and can't do and can and can't say to a minor who comes to you and says, I'm trying to get out of the abusive situation. Here's my situation. Can I even give that person all of their options?

But State Representative Barbara Hart clarifies that supporters of the ban say the lawsuit is more an issue of the rights parents have over their children’s medical decisions.

HART: It doesn't criminalize travel. It criminalizes the taking of a child across the border without the parents permission…[1:00] in any other circumstance, we would call this kidnapping.

David Ripley, the Executive director of Idaho Chooses Life, is concerned about the claims made by those suing the state. But he’s also puzzled about the plaintiffs themselves. Along with Matsumoto and the Northwest Abortion Access Fund, the lawsuit was jointly filed by the Indigenous Idaho Alliance organization, and a gender advocacy group called The Legal Voice.

RIPLEY: It's a strange collection of plaintiffs in my opinion…this is an abortion trafficking bill. It's specific to abortion. Why would an LGBTQ group get involved in an issue like that?

But since the overturning of Roe, Ripley has been responding to new legal developments in the fight for life…and not just life in the womb.

RIPLEY: We're not just talking about abortion in this lawsuit, we're talking about…Concepts like bodily autonomy, sexual freedom. They basically deny the right of parents altogether to manage the health and well being and sexual activities of their children…The child by definition is incapable of really comprehending and appreciating circumstances and complications and risks and potential benefits…There is no age, attached to any of these views about bodily autonomy and the right to who they talk to a right to make decisions, the right to be trafficked across state lines by strangers essentially.

If the lawsuit prevails, Ripley says the legal precedent could lay the groundwork for advocates of transgender procedures to transport children to states supporting so-called gender affirming care.

RIPLEY: [11:31] Again, without parental knowledge, or consent…[13:45] they have taken it upon themselves, to be the arbiter of what is good and bad for a child for whom they have no legal responsibility, and for whom they have no accountability with respect to the implications of what happens afterwards.

Ripley recognizes that not every child’s parent or guardian is safe. Unfortunately, some may even be perpetrators of the pregnancy. Ripley believes the ban also serves to protect those children by bringing their circumstances to the light.

RIPLEY: There are real situations out there, no doubt about it…But the fact is you have a legal duty not just to deal with the pregnancy, you have a legal duty to deal with that child and get that child out of that circumstance…And unless you involve law enforcement, you're treating the symptom…The only hope for that child is law enforcement investigating…And holding people accountable…There's a clear duty under the Idaho law…to intervene in a way that's actually appropriate to make sure that law enforcement figures out what's happening to that child.

The lawsuit against Idaho’s abortion trafficking ban could take months to resolve. Monday’s ruling restored the ability for any woman to get a referral for an abortion out of state. But physically transporting minors to have an abortion without parental consent remains illegal…for now.

Sep 12 2023,Abortion rights group sues on behalf of women denied care in emergencies,Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/health/2023/09/12/abortion-rights-lawsuit-medical-care,"The Center for Reproductive Rights on Tuesday filed legal actions in Tennessee, Idaho and Oklahoma on behalf of women who say they were denied abortion care in medical emergencies. The actions represent an escalation of the strategy the center used earlier this year in a Texas lawsuit arguing that exceptions to protect the life or health of the mother are unclear, jeopardizing the health of pregnant women.

“What’s happening in Texas is the tip of the iceberg,” said Marc Hearron, the center’s senior counsel who is spearheading the three legal actions. The goal, Hearron said, is twofold — to demonstrate that pregnant people are being denied timely medical care wherever abortion is banned, and to give clarity to doctors whom he described as “terrified” of providing the procedure.

Antiabortion groups accuse their opponents of exaggerating the risks to pregnant individuals, dismissing legal actions at the state level as “scare tactics” because abortion rights groups are losing the federal battle. What’s more, they said, broadly written exceptions could allow any abortion clinic to find a health exception to justify the procedure.

In early August, in a temporary victory for abortion rights advocates, a Texas judge ruled that in cases of dangerous or complicated pregnancies, doctors must be allowed to use their “good faith judgment” to provide abortion care. The state immediately appealed the ruling, which is now on hold. Oral arguments are scheduled for late November.

As in Texas, the new filings — lawsuits against the states of Idaho and Tennessee and a federal complaint lodged with the Department of Health and Human Services against a hospital in Oklahoma — do not seek to overturn the abortion bans entirely. Instead, they use personal testimony to expose the physical and mental trauma plaintiffs say they suffered because doctors failed to perform abortions for fear of liability.

The lawsuits in Tennessee and Idaho, a state where there has been an exodus of obstetric specialists in the past year, include physician plaintiffs. They outline the dilemmas confronting doctors who can face penalties including fines, the loss of their medical licenses and prison terms if they perform procedures that are found to violate the bans.

Nicole Blackmon, the lead plaintiff in the Tennessee lawsuit, realized she was pregnant in July 2022. The news came as a happy surprise in a turbulent time of her life, she said. Her son, Daniel, had been slain in a drive-by shooting earlier that year, according to the complaint, and she was managing serious health issues, including a form of hypertension that causes extreme headaches and can lead to vision loss.

Blackmon stopped taking her anti-inflammatory medication to protect the fetus, she said. But a routine, 15-week ultrasound revealed the baby’s stomach and other organs were developing outside its abdomen, as well as showing signs of a lethal malformation known as limb body wall complex, the lawsuit said. She said that in the following weeks, as further tests confirmed the diagnoses, her health worsened.

“It was so much to bear,” Blackmon told The Washington Post. “It was the scariest point in my life. The baby was putting my life at risk.”

After her doctors told her they could not perform an abortion, Blackmon, 31, who lives in Nashville, looked into obtaining one outside Tennessee but felt that traveling was beyond her means, she said. Two months before her due date, as her vision deteriorated and she developed signs of life-threatening preeclampsia, Blackmon’s water broke, according to the complaint. After 32 hours of labor, she delivered a stillborn baby, she said.

“Going through all of that, I don’t want no one to have to suffer or just have to bear the things that I went through. I was lucky enough to survive all of that, but the next person might not be lucky,” Blackmon said. “It made me frightened to go through another pregnancy.”

A spokeswoman for Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti declined to respond, saying they had not reviewed the complaint.

The galvanizing impact this kind of personal testimony can have on public opinion was demonstrated by the Texas case, said Rachel Rebouché, a professor of law at Temple University who specializes in reproductive health law.

That lawsuit drew widespread attention in large part because of the plaintiffs’ graphic, first-person accounts in court. In one particularly harrowing moment, a woman vomited on the stand when she recalled how abandoned she felt after she learned of her baby’s fatal anomalies.

“What has changed a lot of people’s minds have been these high-profile cases of people who have very wanted pregnancies, but nonetheless have been told, ‘Sorry, we cannot provide you care,’” said Rebouché, who noted that abortion access is now the focus of several recent ballot initiatives across the country.

The new cases also raise legal questions about whether states are meeting their obligations to their citizens, she said. “Even outside the court of public opinion, the state may be failing to protect people’s right to life under the state constitution or another law.”

Steven Aden, general counsel for Americans United for Life, accused reproductive rights advocates of creating “a fabrication to scare the public.”

“All of the pro-life doctors I’ve talked to say that there is no state law that prohibits treating a pregnant women who is in emergent circumstances,” Aden said.

The strategy of showing the alleged harm that people with complicated pregnancies have suffered is one front in the abortion battles that have moved largely to the states in the wake of last year’s Supreme Court ruling overturning the federal constitutional right to abortion, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.

Share this article Share

“The abortion industry pivoted after Dobbs because they realized there was no go in the federal courts,” Aden said.

That has put new energy behind ongoing efforts to establish a constitutional right to abortion in states.

“The thinking is, ‘Let’s do at the state level what Roe did at the national level,’” said attorney Ed Whelan, referring to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a federal right to abortion. But there are limitations to that approach, according to Whelan, a senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank: State constitutions are comparatively easy to amend, so the right could be overturned.

But Hearron said the Texas suit was revelatory to people who heard the testimony. “Many people who don’t think they know somebody who has had an abortion are now realizing it affects all of us,” he said.

The testimony also encouraged women in other states to speak out about their experiences, he said.

Allie Phillips, another Tennessee plaintiff, documented her pregnancy loss on social media, describing the turmoil of discovering during a routine ultrasound at 18 weeks and five days that her second baby, Miley Rose, had multiple deformities. Two weeks later, the 28-year-old from Clarksville, who suffers from dehydration following gastric sleeve surgery, traveled to New York for an abortion, where she learned Miley had already died.

Jennifer Adkins, 31, a plaintiff in the Idaho lawsuit, said she never imagined she would sue her state over abortion care. After a 12-week ultrasound revealed her baby’s many defects, doctors warned she was at risk for a rare but dangerous condition known as mirror syndrome, in which the mother’s body begins to mimic the fetus’s life-threatening symptoms. But Adkins said they told her the law prevented them from providing an abortion. She ultimately obtained one in Oregon.

“I can’t stop bad things from happening to people’s pregnancies,” Adkins said. “But I want other Idahoans to feel safe and cared for.”

Idaho Attorney General Raúl R. Labrador did not respond to requests for comment.

Most of the 14 states where abortion is banned have exceptions for medical emergencies, according to KFF, a health policy organization that tracks state laws. Many doctors have argued that those exceptions are written in nonmedical language and fail to reflect the health risks to a mother that come with pregnancy and childbirth.

“People completely underestimate how dangerous a pregnancy can be, even to a healthy person,” said Mae Winchester, a maternal fetal medicine specialist in Ohio. A six-week ban took effect immediately in Ohio after the Dobbs ruling until a judge blocked its enforcement; the state is expected to appeal.

Risks are greater for the many women with preexisting conditions such as diabetes or hypertension. A lethal fetal anomaly adds complications for women weighing the risks to their health, Winchester said. Specialists are avoiding practicing in states with bans, she said, which impacts all kinds of gynecological care — such as the provision of Pap smears and hysterectomies for fibroids.

But Ingrid Skop, an OB/GYN and an expert witness for the state in the Texas lawsuit, has written about managing complex pregnancies during the three decades she practiced in Texas and said her practice remains the same in the wake of the state’s abortion bans.

Skop, who also works for the antiabortion Charlotte Lozier Institute, blames “media misinformation” and “lack of clarity by professional organizations” for the confusion doctors now say they are experiencing. “Rather than reading the law, many physicians read newspapers instead and have erroneously concluded that state pro-life laws prioritized fetal life over the life of the woman,” Skop wrote on the institute’s website.

In an interview, Emily Corrigan, an emergency obstetrician and plaintiff in the Idaho lawsuit, said she has witnessed the chilling impact on her colleagues, several of whom have left the state.

Corrigan’s work, often in the emergency room, is usually protected by a federal law — the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act — requiring hospitals to stabilize patients with an emergency medical condition.

The Center for Reproductive Rights’s legal action in Oklahoma focuses on that issue. In the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Jaci Statton describes the pain and nausea she says she suffered when she discovered that she had a partial molar pregnancy, meaning the fetus would not survive and she was at risk of hemorrhage.

According to the complaint, Statton arrived — bleeding and barely able to walk — at the Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was denied an abortion and instead sent to the Oklahoma Children’s Hospital. There, the complaint says, she and her husband begged staff members to perform an abortion but were told to wait in the parking lot until her condition deteriorated. Statton fled the state on a three-hour drive to get an abortion in Kansas, according to the complaint.

“Our physicians and staff remain steadfast and committed to providing the highest quality and compassionate care for women of all ages and stages of life. Our healthcare complies with state and federal laws and regulatory compliance standards,” said OU Health spokesman David McCollum in a written statement.

The complaint comes after the Center for Reproductive Rights had successfully challenged some of Oklahoma’s abortion bans last year on the grounds that the exceptions were too narrow.

With little possibility of advancing their cause in federal courts, abortion rights groups are fighting the 15-week ban in Florida, where oral arguments were held Friday, and the six-week ban in South Carolina, in addition to these new actions."
Apr 05 2023,Idaho bans 'abortion trafficking',Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/health/idaho-bans-abortion-trafficking,"Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little signed legislation on Wednesday to ban so-called ""abortion trafficking"" in which an adult aids a minor in obtaining an abortion out of state without parental consent.

The law imposes a possible five-year prison sentence for anyone found guilty, The Hill reported. Abortion is legal is several neighboring states, including Washington, Oregon, Montana, and California.

Idaho currently bans nearly all abortions and has an enforcement mechanism wherein family members may sue doctors who perform such procedures.

Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates condemned the governor's signing of the law, saying ""[y]et again, Idaho’s governor disregarded constituents and signed HB 242 into law, creating the nation’s first crime of so-called 'abortion trafficking.'""

""This legislation is despicable, and we’re going to do everything in our power to stop it,"" the group announced, per the outlet.

Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union are already suing over the attorney general's interpretation of state law as barring abortion referrals to out-of-state doctors.

Aug 01 2023,Indiana on the brink of enacting near-total abortion ban,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/news/national/ny-indiana-abortion-ban-aclu-petition-20230801-pimlttjmwjf53hzh3sia5da5ne-story.html,"A near-total abortion ban set to take effect in Indiana on Tuesday is still on hold as reproductive rights advocates continue to fight in court to increase abortion access in the state.

Indiana’s sweeping abortion ban — which outlaws nearly all procedures and threatens abortion providers with criminal penalties — was approved by state lawmakers a year ago, but it was put on hold just a few days after taking effect after opponents took their battle to court.

On June 30, 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled the ban was constitutional and could take effect as soon as Aug. 1.

A near-total abortion ban goes into effect in Indiana on Tuesday. A Planned Parenthood sign is displayed on the outside of a clinic during a news conference on Aug. 1, 2023, in Indianapolis.

On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a petition with the court asking the justices to rehear their challenge while keeping the law blocked.

The move has temporarily stopped the ban from taking effect. The justices will now need to hear a response from the state before the appellate clerk can certify the court’s June ruling.

“From a legal perspective, we’re still in limbo, just waiting for the case to be sent back, and for some clarity,” said Gavin Rose, a senior attorney with the ACLU of Indiana, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.

The Indiana Senate Rules Committee takes testimony on a Republican proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state during a hearing at the Statehouse in Indianapolis on July 26, 2022.

On July 12, the Planned Parenthood division that includes Indiana said it was no longer able to schedule any additional abortion appointments in the state “due to high demand for care.”

As of Tuesday morning, its website states that “a full ban on abortion [has gone] into effect in Indiana, with very limited exceptions.”

The nonprofit asks anyone in the state seeking care to reach out to its office.

“Our staff is ready to help you find an appointment and provide you with the information and resources you need to access care,” the website says.

In this file photo, abortion-rights protesters fill Indiana Statehouse corridors and cheer outside legislative chambers on Aug. 5, 2022.

On Tuesday, officials with the nonprofit said their fight will continue, adding that health centers in Indiana will refer those looking for an abortion to nearby states where the procedure remains legal.

“We are here today to assure all Hoosiers — whether you’re white, Black, brown, or Indigenous; whether you’re straight, gay, or trans; whether you have health insurance or you’re uninsured — Planned Parenthood will never back down, not now, not ever, from providing you the care you need,” Rebecca Gibron, the group’s CEO, told reporters in a press conference.

“No matter what the extremists try to do in the political corridors and courtrooms of Indiana, Planned Parenthood will keep providing Hoosiers with birth control, vasectomies, STI prevention and treatment, gender-affirming care for adults, and referrals to abortion care in other states where it is protected,” she added.

A request for comment from the Daily News wasn’t immediately returned Tuesday morning."
Aug 01 2023,"States where abortion is legal, banned or under threat",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/abortion-state-laws-criminalization-roe/,"Access to abortion remains a patchwork of state-by-state policies after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , with abortion restricted across much of the Southern United States. In the six months that followed the ruling, there were an estimated 43,410 fewer legal abortions in states that had bans, according to a recent survey .

New restrictions are continuing to take effect, with Republican-led legislatures pushing to enact bans in some states that have become abortion havens. A six-week ban passed in Florida in April 2023 is currently not enacted as the state Supreme Court reviews the state’s abortion laws. If enacted, the ban would outlaw most abortions in the country’s third-most-populous state. More restrictions in other states are almost certainly on the way."
Aug 23 2023,Fox Debate Moderator Claims Abortion a ‘Losing Issue’ for GOP,Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/08/23/fox-debate-moderator-claims-abortion-a-losing-issue-for-republicans,"Fox News host Martha MacCallum introduced the topic of abortion during the Republican presidential primary debate on Wednesday as a “losing issue” for Republicans going into the 2024 presidential race.

MacCallum pointed to select losses, like several ballot initiatives, to support her claim in what seemed like an effort to push Republican presidential candidates to the left on abortion.

“Abortion has been a losing issue for Republicans since the Dobbs decision,” MacCallum claimed. “In six state referendums, all have upheld abortion rights in this country. Even in red states, there are more swing state referendums that are coming up as we head into the elections as well on this.”

The comments come as pro-life organizations and politicians decide how to best proceed now that the issue of abortion has been returned to the states and their elected representatives. While some Republicans would rather leave the fate of the unborn to individual states, others are hoping for a 15-week minimum federal ban when unborn babies are thought to be capable of experiencing pain.

The moderators notably made limited mention of pro-life victories since the Dobbs decision in framing their questions, instead opting to push candidates on if they would support federal legislation limiting abortion.

Since the Supreme Court issued the Dobbs decision, 25 states — half the country — now have some sort of legislation protecting unborn babies. Every single governor that passed pro-life protections also retained their positions in their last elections."

The new law has some exceptions.

Those include, a pregnancy that endangers the life of the mother, a health issue with the baby, and in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks.

Aug 23 2023,S.C. High Court Upholds 6-Week Abortion Restriction,Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/newsfront/south-carolina-abortion-ban/2023/08/23/id/1131803,"South Carolina's new all-male Supreme Court reversed course on abortion Wednesday, upholding a law banning most such procedures except in the earliest weeks of pregnancy.

The continued erosion of legal abortion access across the U.S. South comes after Republican state lawmakers replaced the lone woman on the court, Justice Kaye Hearn, who reached the state's mandatory retirement age.

The 4-1 ruling departs from the court's own decision months earlier striking down a similar ban that the Republican-led Legislature passed in 2021. The latest ban takes effect immediately.

Writing for the new majority, Justice John Kittredge acknowledged that the 2023 law also infringes on ""a woman's right of privacy and bodily autonomy,"" but said the state Legislature reasonably determined this time around that those interests don't outweigh ""the interest of the unborn child to live.""

""As a Court, unless we can say that the balance struck by the Legislature was unreasonable as a matter of law, we must uphold the Act,"" Kittredge wrote.

Kittredge wrote that ""we leave for another day"" a determination on what the law's language means for when exactly during a pregnancy the ban should begin, likely forecasting another long court fight on that question.

Chief Justice Donald Beatty provided the lone dissent, arguing that the 2023 law is nearly identical, with definitions for terms including ""fetal heartbeat"" and ""conception"" that provide no clarity on when the ban begins, exposing doctors to criminal charges if law enforcement disagrees with their expertise.

The Planned Parenthood South Atlantic clinic in Columbia had served only a ""handful"" of the roughly 30 patients scheduled for abortions Wednesday when the ruling came down, according to Dr. Katherine Farris, the group's chief medical officer. The center — one of three clinics in the state — has paused abortions while officials work to understand the ruling's implications.

Beatty warned that the majority's failure to address such a key question could lead to political retribution. He added that judicial independence and integrity were weakened by the court's decision to backpedal on its prior ruling.

Hearn wrote the majority's lead opinion in January striking down the ban as a violation of the state constitution's right to privacy. She then reached the court's mandatory retirement age, enabling the GOP-led Legislature to put Gary Hill on what is now the nation's only state Supreme Court with an entirely male bench.

Republican lawmakers then crafted a new law to address Justice John Few's concern, expressed in the January ruling, that the Legislature had failed to take into account whether the restrictions were reasonable enough to infringe upon a woman's privacy rights.

Abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, sued again. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's lawyer said during oral arguments this summer that both laws limited abortions at the same point in pregnancy and were equally unconstitutional.

The 2023 law restricts most abortions once cardiac activity can be detected, declaring that this happens about six weeks after a pregnant woman's last menstrual period. Lawmakers defined this as ""the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.""

But Beatty wrote that at six weeks, the fetus doesn't exist yet — it's still an embryo — and the heart doesn't develop until later in a pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says it's inaccurate to call such ""cardiac activity"" a heartbeat.

""The terminology is medically and scientifically inaccurate. As such, it is the quintessential example of political gaslighting; attempting to manipulate public opinion and control the reproductive health decisions of women by distorting reality,"" Beatty wrote.

The newly sworn Hill joined Wednesday's majority along with Few, who had previously voted to overturn the 2021 law. In a separate concurring opinion, Few wrote that the state constitution's right to privacy does not provide blanket protections against ""reasonable"" invasions.

The majority opinion found a key difference in the lawmakers' deletion of a reference to a pregnant woman having the right to make an ""informed choice."" The 2023 law expanded ""the notion of choice to the period of time before fertilization, certainly before a couple passively learns of a pregnancy,"" Few wrote.

That change lengthens the window for couples to avoid unwanted pregnancies by promoting ""active family planning."" In addition, the new law provides insured contraceptives to ""almost all couples"" and places responsibility on sexually active couples to actively use pregnancy tests, Few wrote.

Planned Parenthood South Atlantic's lawyer had noted during oral arguments that such analysis ignored the possibility for failures in testing and contraceptives.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that provided nationwide access to abortion, most GOP-controlled states have enacted or adopted abortion bans of some kind. All have been challenged in court.

Republican officials in South Carolina celebrated what Gov. Henry McMaster called ""the culmination of years of hard work"" to curtail abortion access. Republican legislative leaders scrambled at the end of the session to pass the new limits as the number of abortions increased rapidly under the state's reversion to a 22-week ban passed in 2016.

Republican South Carolina Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said Wednesday that he anticipates future challenges based on the definition of cardiac activity. Still, he expects the new ruling will put the issue to rest next session.

That is, at least until 2024 elections possibly alter the composition of a state Senate that fell just shy several times this past year of clearing procedural hurdles to enact a near-total ban.

More court shakeups are also coming. Beatty must retire in 2024 because he, too, will reach the mandated retirement age of 72 for judges. Kittredge is the only judge who applied to replace him. The Legislature is expected to approve Kittredge and choose another new justice next year."
Jul 31 2023,New abortion bill in Indiana goes into effect August 1,ABC 57,center,https://abc57.com/news/new-abortion-bill-in-indiana-goes-into-effect-august-1,"New abortion bill in Indiana goes into effect August 1

SOUTH BEND, Ind - The new abortion bill is going into effect in less than 24 hours, pro-choice advocates met here at the civil rights heritage center to discuss how to get people more engaged on reproductive rights.

While pro-life groups say it’s a day of celebration and pro-choice activists worry this will put more pregnant women in danger.

“This is going to be devastating for people in Indiana,” said Karen Nemes, Acting Director of Pro-Choice South Bend.

A call-to-action as activists rally for reproductive justice in south bend, Monday.

Nemes worries Indiana's near-total abortion ban will negatively impact Hoosier's reproductive healthcare.

“Right now, Indiana is 45th in the country for infant mortality and 47th in the country, so if our legislators really care about mothers and babies and families, I think they could be putting their efforts to improving those numbers and really put their money where their mouth is,” said Nemes.

The new law taking effect August 1 still has exceptions for the mother's health, and if the fetus has a fatal abnormality up to 20 weeks and a woman could still get an abortion for cases of rape and incest 10 weeks after fertilization.

Pro-life advocate Melanie Lyon who is the Executive Director of Voices for Life, is celebrating the new bill, despite the pushback and delays.

“Tomorrow we are going to wake up in a better Indiana, tomorrow we are going to wake up in and Indiana where preborn children are more protected,” said Lyon.

State representative Maureen Bauer attended Monday's rally, though the republican-dominated legislature makes any expansions to access for abortions unlikely.

“By restricting women's healthcare access in the state of Indiana we will continue to hear stories of loss and of poor maternal health outcomes in the state so were just gathering to share information about where we go from here when the law goes into effect,” said Bauer.

There is still one lawsuit against Indiana's new abortion law, citing religious exceptions.

It could add another path for women seeking abortion services but won't stop Indiana's new law from taking effect.

""We’re going to be celebrating, celebrate all the women and children who will be spared the violence of abortion, cause this legislation is going into effect and we have voices for life realizes there still are a lot of challenges ahead to the pro-life movement but if we can celebrate one life being saved then that’s something that’s worthy of celebration, it’s a victory on its own,” said Lyon.

As of now, the ACLU has asked the state's high court to put the near total abortion ban on hold."

Sep 25 2023,Missouri judge rewrites ballot questions for abortion amendment to remove 'unborn child',Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/judge-rewrites-ballot-questions-abortion-amendment-remove-unborn-child,"A Missouri judge rewrote the ballot summaries for six proposed initiative petitions to institute abortion rights into the state constitution to remove language such as “unborn child,” “end the life,” and “the right to life” — a setback to the anti-abortion rights side.

In a ruling issued on Monday, Judge Jon Beetem wrote that 13 of the phrases used in the summaries written by Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft were “argumentative” and obscured the intention of the amendment to protect abortion rights and other rights related to reproduction.

DESANTIS UNDER PRESSURE TO GET OFF THE ROPES IN SECOND REPUBLICAN DEBATE

A near-total abortion restriction in Missouri took effect immediately after the announcement of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization Supreme Court decision in June 2022 that overturned federal abortion rights.

Anna Fitz-James, representing the political action committee Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, filed 11 versions of an abortion amendment proposal to enshrine abortion into the state constitution in March.

Beetem said Ashcroft, who is running in the gubernatorial election on a strong anti-abortion platform, ignored the other elements of reproductive healthcare in the ballot summaries, such as contraception and fertility care.

Beetem wrote, “The Court further finds that while the proposals will have the greatest immediate impact on abortion, the absence of any reference to reproductive health care beyond abortion is insufficient in that it would cause a voter to believe that abortion is the only health care comprising the initiatives.”

Beetem’s revised ballot summaries begin with an identical first sentence in each, which asks Missouri voters if they want to “establish a right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraceptives, with any government interference of that right presumed invalid.”

In the order, Judge Beetem wrote, “The Court finds that certain phrases included in the Secretary’s summary statement are problematic in that they are either argumentative or do not fairly describe the purposes or probably effect of the initiative.” https://t.co/4Oj5hKezxB pic.twitter.com/SYuU5DsHsO — ACLU of Missouri (@aclu_mo) September 25, 2023



In a separate ruling issued on Monday, Beetem dismissed the lawsuit filed by two state lawmakers in August against the proposal’s financial impact statement, which noted the abortion amendment would impose significant costs to the state that were not sufficiently described in the ballot summaries. Beetem upheld the fiscal note summary written by state Auditor Scott Fitzpatrick.

The ACLU, which represented Fitz-James in the case, praised the decision as a victory against anti-abortion special interest groups.

This is how the process should work. When a politician oversteps by inserting biased language into the ballot process, courts should rein in that attempt to interfere.

Sep 25 2023,A judge has rewritten Missouri ballot summary language that described 'dangerous' abortions,Newsday,center,https://newsday.com/news/nation/a-judge-has-rewritten-missouri-ballot-summary-language-that-described-dangerous-abortions-wwgu2vk2,"COLUMBIA, Mo. — A Missouri judge tossed Republican-written ballot summary language Monday that described several proposed constitutional amendments as allowing “dangerous and unregulated abortions until live birth.”

Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem rewrote the ballot summary to describe the language as establishing the “right to make decisions about reproductive health care, including abortion and contraception,” as well as undoing the state’s almost total ban on abortions.

In Missouri, summaries are provided to voters on ballots to help quickly explain sometimes lengthy and complicated proposals. The office of Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, which wrote the summaries, plans to appeal.

“We will not stand idly by while the courts hide the effects of this amendment and mislead the people as to what they may very well be voting on next year,” spokesperson JoDonn Chaney said. Ashcroft is running for governor in 2024.

Missouri is among several states, including Ohio, where abortion opponents are fighting efforts to ensure or restore access to the procedure following the fall of Roe v. Wade last year.

Abortion-rights proponents sued, saying Ashcroft's summaries were misleading. Beetem agreed in his ruling Monday.

“The Court saw Ashcroft’s proposed summary statements for what they were — the language of a biased politician seeking the support of special interest groups,” Anthony Rothert, director of integrated advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, said in a statement. “The new summaries go a long way toward fairly describing the right to make reproductive health care decisions without government interference.”

Yamelsie Rodríguez, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri, said in a statement that Missouri officials “have held hostage the right to reproductive freedom” for decades.

Beetem also ruled Monday against abortion opponents who argued that the state auditor’s cost estimates for the measures were misleadingly low because they did not account for potential losses of all Medicaid funding and property and sales tax revenue as a result of lower birth rates.

Abortion opponents did not provide any “facts or credible legal assessment” to support claims that the federal government will take back all of Missouri’s Medicaid funding if abortion is once again legalized, and the argument to include potential loss in future taxes due to lower birth rates includes “so many assumptions as to damage its credibility,” Beetem ruled.

A measure to ensure abortion access is on the November ballot in Ohio after withstanding legal challenges from opponents. That state’s voters in August rejected a measure that would have required at least 60% of the vote to amend the state constitution, an approach supported by abortion opponents that would have made it harder to adopt the November ballot question.

Ballot measures on abortion could also be put before voters in 2024 in states including Arizona, Maryland, New York and South Dakota. But in conservative Oklahoma, an initiative petition to legalize abortion was withdrawn soon after it started last year.

Conservatives’ challenges to the ballot questions have been so intense partly because of the way the votes have been going. After the ruling last year, the issue appeared on the ballot in six states. In all of them, including generally conservative Kansas and Kentucky, the abortion rights side prevailed."

Sep 15 2022,Abortion Bill,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/abortion-bill,"A libertarian's take



“Graham cites the federal government's power to regulate interstate commerce, ‘as interpreted by the Supreme Court.’ Since the Court has stretched that power to accommodate nearly anything Congress wants to do, that argument looks more promising. But even the super-elastic Commerce Clause invented by the Court's precedents may not be malleable enough to cover a nationwide ban on abortion after 14 weeks of gestation…



“Unfortunately for them, Democrats are in no position to argue that abortion legislation exceeds the federal government's enumerated powers. They not only rely on an expansive understanding of the Commerce Clause to justify much of their agenda; they have explicitly cited the Commerce Clause as a license for Congress to override state decisions regarding abortion…



“The late Justice Antonin Scalia complained that Roe ‘destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level.’ The compromise that Scalia envisioned—letting states go their own way on abortion—is today threatened by maximalists on both sides of the issue.”

May 23 2023,SC Senate passes abortion ban,The Times and Democrat,center,https://thetandd.com/news/sc-senate-passes-abortion-ban/article_84f278be-f9bd-11ed-aa28-77eb1f6c2ac4.html,"COLUMBIA — The South Carolina Senate approved a bill Tuesday that would ban most abortions after around six weeks of pregnancy — before most people know they are pregnant – and sent it to the governor who has promised to sign it.

The proposal restores a ban South Carolina had in place when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year — a ban that, once it took effect, was overturned by the state’s highest court because it violated the state Constitution’s right to privacy.

Republicans have been searching for an answer to that ruling because it left abortion legal through 22 weeks of pregnancy and sharply increased the number of abortions taking place in South Carolina as most other Southern states enacted stricter laws.

The bill includes exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies, the patient’s life and health, and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. Doctors could face felony charges carrying two years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine.

The Republican-led Senate’s opportunity to pass the bill came after the South Carolina House backed off a proposal to ban abortion almost entirely at conception. Senators had not been able to get the votes for that proposal after three different tries.

The vote also came after the three Republican women in the Senate urged the other members of their party to adopt a 12-week abortion ban as they fought additional restrictions one month after helping filibuster a near-total ban. They joined all Democrats in voting against the bill.

In blistering speeches, the three Republican women said the 12-week proposal did not give women enough time to make a decision, and they criticized changes like one requiring child support beginning at conception as ridiculous. Republican Sen. Katrina Shealy endorsed the 12-week ban as a “real compromise.”

Republicans said they tweaked parts of the new law so it can pass judicial review. The author of the 3-2 state Supreme Court’s leading opinion overturning the ban was also replaced after she had to retire due to age.

Shealy and Republican Sen. Penry Gustafson pushed back on assertions that they are not true Christians because of their positions.

“We in the South Carolina Legislature are not God. We do not know what’s going on in somebody else’s life. We do not have the right to make decisions for someone else,” Shealy said.

House Republicans also axed a section of the measure allowing minors to petition the court for an abortion up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.

Republican Majority Leader Shane Massey outlined new regulations and definitions inserted by the Republican-dominated South Carolina House last week during proceedings slowed by hundreds of amendments from Democrats across two days.

The women senators entered the State House together Tuesday to rousing cheers from the dozens of abortion rights supporters gathered on the main floor. All five donned buttons that read “elect more women.”

This week marks the fourth time that the chamber has taken up abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. During last month’s filibuster, the five women criticized male leadership for repeatedly calling the debate. Speaking consecutively from the well, they at times talked about the physical changes that occur throughout pregnancy or highlighted separate issues they wanted to solve.

The Senate’s 15 Democrats, unified against both abortion bans, have largely let the Republican majority debate the issue among themselves. Opponents argue that South Carolina’s high maternal mortality rates — with even poorer outcomes among Black patients — would grow worse under the new restrictions.

Abortion currently remains legal through 22 weeks in South Carolina, though other regulations largely block access after the first trimester at the state’s three clinics. But the law has gone unchanged amid a Republican disagreement over how far to restrict access that has only recently moved toward resolution.

Republican leaders have noted provisional state Health Department data that show rising numbers of abortions in South Carolina.

The action comes one week after Republicans in the North Carolina General Assembly moved to enact a 12-week abortion ban by overriding the Democratic governor’s veto — pushing Virginia closer to being the last state in the region with relatively easy access.

Lawmakers anticipate legal challenges for any ban that ultimately becomes law. The South Carolina Supreme Court overturned a similar 2021 law as a violation of the state constitution’s right to privacy in a 3-2 decision this January. But many Republicans believe the latest version would stand after changes to both the proposal’s language and the court’s makeup."
Aug 21 2023,Indiana Supreme Court denies ACLU appeal on abortion ban,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/indiana-supreme-court-allows-abortion-ban-take-effect,"The Indiana Supreme Court denied the American Civil Liberties Union‘s request for an appeal on the state’s near-total abortion ban on Monday, allowing the strict abortion ban to take effect immediately in the Hoosier State.

On behalf of Planned Parenthood, ACLU attorneys petitioned the state’s high court on July 31 for an injunction against the state’s abortion statute until the court can hear the full case of the appeal on religious liberty grounds, which is scheduled for December.

REPUBLICANS FACE UPHILL BATTLE IN EFFORT TO UNSEAT PENNSYLVANIA SEN. BOB CASEY

Four of the five justices on the Court denied the injunction because the ACLU’s case did not “properly” explain how the current abortion statute will affect women with serious medical conditions or affect healthcare providers.

The state Supreme Court recently upheld the law under legal challenge on a 3-2 decision, which argued that the legislature has a broad authority to regulate abortion except in the instances in which an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother.

The current statute prevents all abortions except in the cases of severe fetal anomalies, severe health impacts for the mother up to 20 weeks gestation, and conception from rape or incest up to 10 weeks of gestation. The law also requires all abortions to be conducted in hospital settings rather than at home or in outpatient facilities.

Healthcare and abortion providers in Indiana were operating under the law’s provisions since Aug. 1, when the law was scheduled to take effect prior to the ACLU’s request for an injunction.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita posted on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that he was satisfied with the opinion saying that the anti-abortion law “protects the lives of innocent unborn babies.”

“We defeated the pro-death advocates who try to interject their views in a state that clearly voted for life,” Rokita said.

But Planned Parenthood is still here for you. Our patient navigators are here to help you access the care you need.”

The ACLU added that Monday was a “dark day in Indiana” due to the denial.

The ACLU’s argument in the appeal scheduled for December uses the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act to argue that the state’s near-total ban violates the rights of those who do not subscribe to the traditional Christian ethic that life begins at conception.

Sep 08 2023,Abortion rights hang in the balance at state Supreme Court oral arguments,Florida Politics,center,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/633374-abortion-rights-hang-in-the-balance-at-state-supreme-court-oral-arguments,"The Florida Supreme Court is poised to make a crucial decision potentially affecting not only Florida residents’ abortion rights but also marking an entire swath of the country as a place where abortion is mostly off-limits.

Justices will hold oral arguments today on whether Florida’s existing 15-week abortion ban violates the privacy clause in the state constitution enacted by voters in 1980. And if the Supreme Court agrees with the state’s case, it will clear the way for new legislation further restricting abortion to go into effect 30 days after the court’s ruling.

That new law (SB 300) the Legislature passed earlier this year bans abortion before most people know they are pregnant — after six weeks of pregnancy unless the mother’s life is at risk, or the patient can produce proof of rape or incest. The case the court will hear today has kept that law from going into effect.

Florida is currently the only place from Texas to South Carolina and north to Tennessee where abortion is allowed at 15 weeks. Those states and all those between either ban it after six weeks or allow it only under special circumstances.

Previously, the high court had blocked another abortion law based on a privacy clause voters approved in 1980.

Attorney General Ashley Moody has asked the court to overturn the 1989 ruling, contending that it is as “egregiously wrong” as the Roe decision and that the privacy clause was never intended to include abortion.

“Far from a hidden thought whispered in the confines of the home, the effects of abortion ripple throughout society, from the women who endure it to the medical staff who perform it, to the unborn lives extinguished by it,” states the brief from Moody and her legal team.

But attorneys representing the abortion clinics and the physician challenging the law with the 15-week ban point out that voters in 2012 rejected a constitutional amendment proposed by the Legislature that would have wiped out the 1989 ruling.

“The state asks this court to override the will of the people and do with the stroke of a pen precisely what the people rejected at the ballot box,” states the brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups.

All eyes will be on Justice Charles Canady. Some have called for him to recuse himself because his wife, Republican state Rep. Jennifer Canady, R-Lakeland, co-sponsored the six-week ban that would soon become Florida law after the ruling.

The Liberty Counsel, which bills itself as a religious civil liberties law firm, filed an amicus brief supporting the state’s case and noted Florida’s role in the Southeast region since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the court decisions that guaranteed abortion rights up to when a fetus can survive outside the womb — at about 24 weeks — throughout the country.

“Tragically, after … Roe (v. Wade) and Casey (v. Planned Parenthood) abortion decisions were overturned, Florida has become a sanctuary for abortion, said Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman, according to a prepared statement. “Now the Florida Supreme Court must establish this as a state that values unborn life according to the state Constitution.”

In the background, however, a coalition of groups have come together to form Floridians Protecting Freedom (FPF). It’s a political committee pressing for another constitutional amendment that would render the high court’s opinion moot if cleared to be on the ballot and approved.

If the petition garners enough signatures to get on the ballot and then the question wins the approval of 60% or more of voters, the state constitution would be amended to guarantee abortion rights as Floridians had for nearly 50 years before last June’s Supreme Court decision.

The group announced Wednesday it had gathered enough petition signatures to trigger a state Supreme Court review of the question.

One-third of the 891,523 required validated signatures that need to be validated by Feb. 1 — 297,799 signatures — have been validated, the official state tracker shows.

If it goes on the ballot, the referendum would ask voters to agree that “no law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s health care provider.”

Lauren Brenzel, FPF campaign director, said that Floridians, who polls show overwhelmingly support abortion rights, should take heart no matter the outcome of Friday’s oral arguments.

“Our campaign is poised to give voters the chance to reclaim their freedom and put a stop to politicians interfering in our personal medical decisions once and for all,” Brenzel said in a prepared statement.

Sep 08 2023,Florida Supreme Court set to weigh fate of strict abortion law,Washington Post,left,https://washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/09/08/florida-supreme-court-abortion,"Members of Florida’s conservative Supreme Court appeared skeptical during a hearing Friday that the state constitution was intended to protect abortion rights — a perspective that could pave the way for one of the country’s strictest and most far-reaching abortion bans. Cut through the 2024 election noise. Get The Campaign Moment newsletter. ArrowRight The case, brought by Planned Parenthood and other Florida-based abortion providers, centers on a provision in the Florida Constitution that protects the right to privacy, added by voters in 1980 and long interpreted by courts as a safeguard against abortion restrictions.

Several justices drilled the lawyers on both sides of the case on how they could know what was in the mind of Florida voters when they passed the privacy amendment. The justices asked: Were they thinking about the government collecting and distributing records — informational privacy — or where they thinking about making decisions in private, like whether to have an abortion?

“In a legal sense, privacy may have included abortion, but it doesn’t seem like the people of Florida really had an actual debate over this when it was adopted,” said Chief Justice Carlos Muñiz.

The state Supreme Court decision could have a two-step impact on abortion access in Florida. While justices will consider the constitutionality of the state’s existing 15-week ban, which took effect last summer, their ruling will also determine the fate of a far stricter law passed this spring that would outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Florida’s six-week ban is written to take effect only if the Supreme Court green-lights the 15-week law, 30 days after a potential ruling.

During the hearing, Whitney White, the attorney representing the abortion providers, argued that women’s lives are at stake. She described doctors “finding their hands tied” by the 15-week ban, unable to treat medical complications during pregnancy until patients develop life-threatening conditions.

“These injustices have been ongoing for a year, and if this court doesn’t step in now, there is an even more dangerous six-week ban waiting in the wings,” she said.

The state Supreme Court — which has struck down several abortion restrictions over the past few decades — has been reshaped by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) into what many consider one of the most conservative courts in the country. Several judges have roots in the antiabortion movement.

At the end of the hearing, Muñiz asked White whether the court should consider the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. He appeared to suggest that he considers fetuses to be human beings.

“You are asking us to essentially take a whole class of human beings and put them outside the protection of the law,” he said. The Supreme Court, he added, has “eviscerated” the idea that privacy protections extend to abortion rights.

“We now know that the same entity that created that understanding of the right of privacy has told us it was a mirage,” he said. “Should we take that into account?”

White told the court that the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization — which overturned the federal right to an abortion — should not matter.

“Nothing in the Dobbs decision displaces preexisting state constitutional protections for abortions that were more protective than the federal law,” she said.

Both abortion bans passed by Florida lawmakers include exceptions for the life of the mother and fatal fetal anomalies. The six-week ban includes additional exceptions for rape and incest and would also provide $25 million in annual state funding for crisis pregnancy centers, organizations that aim to dissuade people from getting abortions.

The outcome of the case could have sweeping implications for abortion access across the country. Last year, more than 82,000 people got abortions in Florida, far more than were previously reported in any of the 17 states that have now banned all or most abortions. Of those states, Texas had the most reported abortions before the new wave of antiabortion laws, with more than 50,000 abortions performed in the state in 2019.

The 15-week ban has compelled many patients to seek abortion care elsewhere, including those with life-threatening pregnancy complications. A six-week ban in Florida would impact tens of thousands of more people, further straining already full abortion clinics in states such as North Carolina and Illinois.

Post-Watergate concerns about civil liberties in part led to the 1980 Florida constitutional privacy amendment — which was passed by about 60 percent of state voters — granting “the right to be let alone and free from governmental intrusion into the person’s private life.” Abortion rights advocates at the time viewed the amendment as an insurance policy in case Roe v. Wade someday fell.

The clause has buttressed some of the strongest and broadest privacy laws in the country, making Florida a destination for abortion access long before Roe was overturned.

But several of the justices argued that Floridians did not necessarily know they were voting to protect abortion rights in 1980.

“How would you respond to the fact that there is really virtually no sort of attention given to this subject in 1980?” asked Justice Jamie Grosshans. “Your brief doesn’t have very many supporting documents to show that that was the understanding of any voter in the state in 1980. Abortion has always been a divisive issue — it was divisive in 1980 — why is there not more that emphasizes your view of what that term meant at the time?”

White responded that without knowing what voters were thinking, the words of the clause speak for themselves.

“The plain text is paramount,” she said. But she added that one reason for the absence of that debate “could have been a general acceptance that Roe v. Wade was the law of the land at the time.”

But then Justice John Couriel interrupted: “But you don’t even see that. You don’t even see any op-eds saying this is about Roe.”

DeSantis selected five of the seven justices on the state’s high court, the most selected by any Florida governor in a generation.

DeSantis’s nomination of Muñiz, the chief justice, was cheered by an antiabortion group that described the judge’s family as supporters of a Tallahassee crisis pregnancy center. Grosshans, another DeSantis pick, was active with Christian legal advocacy groups that oppose abortion before she joined the court.

Justice Charles Canady, a former Republican congressman appointed by then-Gov. Charlie Crist (R), was public about his staunch antiabortion views when he sponsored legislation in 1995 to outlaw abortions later in pregnancy. His wife, state Rep. Jennifer Canady (R), co-sponsored the six-week abortion ban. Canady did not ask questions during Friday’s hearing.

Paul Flemming, the court spokesperson, declined to comment for this story on behalf of the justices.

The court’s decision could have political implications for DeSantis, who is running for president. He has cited the six-week ban as evidence of his conservative credentials, which could prove helpful in the Republican primary, but he has drawn criticism from some antiabortion activists for his failure to back a proposed nationwide ban.

If the court upholds the 15-week ban, abortion rights advocates are hopeful that voters could eventually restore access to abortion. Florida is one of several states where abortion rights groups have launched a campaign to get a measure enshrining abortion protections into the state constitution on the November 2024 ballot.

“This ballot initiative is the only way to reverse course for the 15-week or six-week ban in a time-effective manner,” said Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for Floridians Protecting Freedom. She added that if the six-week ban goes into effect, “the devastation that that will cause for Floridians cannot be overstated.”

Nearly 900,000 signatures have to be certified as valid by Feb. 1 for the measure to go before voters next year. The group says it has enough signatures verified by the state to trigger a Florida Supreme Court review of the language, a key milestone in the effort. The Florida secretary of state moved Thursday to begin that process, according to a letter sent to the state attorney general, which the campaign confirmed."
Oct 06 2023,Over 100 black pastors oppose ballot initiative to enshrine abortion in Ohio constitution,The Christian Post,right,https://christianpost.com/news/over-100-black-pastors-oppose-ohios-abortion-ballot-initiative.html,"Home News Over 100 black pastors oppose ballot initiative to enshrine abortion in Ohio constitution

More than 100 black faith and community leaders in Ohio are urging Ohioans to vote against an upcoming ballot measure that would place a right to abortion in the state constitution, arguing that the issue is a ""life-or-death"" matter for the black community.

The bipartisan group of black faith leaders organized by Choose Life Ohio released a joint letter Tuesday in opposition to Issue 1, the ballot initiative Ohioans will vote on in November. The faith leaders argued that the issue is not partisan or a ""party-line vote,"" highlighting the impact abortion has had on black women and families.

Ohio Issue 1 would establish a constitutional right to ""make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,"" including abortion, contraception and fertility treatment. The amendment would allow the state to restrict abortion after fetal viability but not when deemed “necessary to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.”

""The Black community has been the target of the abortion industry for decades, beginning with the deplorable ideology of racist eugenicist Margaret Sanger, whose Planned Parenthood organization purposefully established abortion mills in minority neighborhoods and targeted our communities for abortions,"" the letter reads.

""Sanger's mission was to kill Black babies before they entered the world, and Planned Parenthood and the for-profit abortion industry have allowed that mission to continue to this very day.""

Citing a 2022 U.S. Census Bureau report, the faith leaders noted that Ohio's black population is overrepresented in the state's abortion data. While black individuals account for only 13% of Ohio's population, the letter contends that 48% of women who undergo abortions in the state are black.

The letter also cited a Washington Examiner report that estimates that at least 20 million black children have likely been aborted between 1973 and the reversal of Roe v. Wade last June, which the letter noted is ""enough to fill the Ohio stadium more than 194 times.""

The religious leaders claim Issue 1 helps the abortion industry push an ""agenda driven by racism and greed,"" condemning the measure as ""more extreme"" than Roe. The pastors echoed objections to Issue 1 voiced by pro-life advocates, believing that the measure would allow abortion throughout all nine months and allow minors to obtain abortions without parental consent.

""Our faith sustains us every day, and it must now spur us on to defeat this amendment and save countless Black lives in doing so,"" the document continues. ""Together, we must send a message to the abortion industry by stopping Issue 1. We must end the targeting of Black babies and instead promote a culture of life.""

Brian Williams, senior pastor of Hope City House of Prayer in Columbus, Ohio, was one of the spiritual leaders who signed on to the letter. In an interview with The Christian Post, Williams declared that the stakes surrounding Issue 1 are much higher than if the measure were a piece of legislation.

""This is an amendment to the Ohio Constitution, which, if this is passed, will be forever enshrined until it's overturned one day,"" he said.

The pastor said that his church promotes the sanctity of life from a biblical standpoint and encourages the congregation to become involved in the civic process by providing voter registration.

""And it's not just for this issue, but any issue that is relevant to our faith,"" he said. ""We try to call people to take a stand and use the power of the vote to reflect their values.""

Williams believes that faith leaders have a duty to speak on issues like abortion, asserting that it's ""a betrayal of our faith, a betrayal of our ethnicity, and a betrayal of babies in the womb"" if spiritual leaders remain silent.

While Williams would like to see voters block the amendment, he's hopeful that society will work to create a culture of life that not only values the preborn child but throughout all stages of life by building social structures that provide for the child's educational and health care needs.

""So, when we talk about being pro-life, our hope is that the message of life will transcend into every atmosphere and every sphere of life that makes sense,"" he said.

Regardless of the outcome, the pastor will continue to advocate against abortion because the public will likely look to Ohio as an example as other states throughout the country potentially seek to enact similar measures.

""So, I think an extra incentive for us is realizing that people are watching Ohio, especially black leaders addressing this who historically have been in lockstep with the Democratic Party,"" Williams said."
Oct 26 2023,Backlash spreads over House Speaker Mike Johnson’s far right positions on abortion and gay rights,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/2023/10/26/backlash-spreads-over-house-speaker-mike-johnsons-far-right-wing-positions-on-abortion-and-gay-rights,"Rep. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) swept to victory in the House Speaker race on the back of a soft-spoken easygoing demeanor and a lack of enemies within the deeply divided Republican caucus.

But within hours of Johnson’s winning the gavel, a major backlash was growing Thursday over his extreme right-wing views on issues ranging from abortion and gay rights to former President Donald Trump’s failed effort to overturn the 2020 election.

The little-known compromise candidate backs a national abortion ban and has supported making gay sex a crime.

Johnson signed onto a doomed lawsuit that claimed the votes of some battleground states won by President Biden should not count and opposed certifying Biden’s win in the hours after the violent Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

Johnson appears to have little desire to talk about his conservative views. He brushed off a question about his election denial at a press conference with an aw shucks smile as fellow Republicans shouted down the reporter who raised the issue.

Despite Johnson’s views, he won the unanimous enthusiastic backing of a group of Republican moderates who torpedoed Rep. Jim Jordan’s speaker bid just last week.

Rep. Mike Lawler, who represents a Westchester County-based district, and several other newly elected Republicans from suburban swing districts cheered Johnson’s win as a breakthrough to end the three weeks of gridlock since Johnson’s predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, was toppled by a group of far right rebels.

“Mike is … a good family man & a smart, well thought leader who loves this Nation,” Rep. Anthony D’Esposito, who last year won a Long Island district that Biden carried by nearly 15%, wrote on Twitter.

But Democrats vowed to use Johnson’s far right views as campaign fodder to oust the moderate Republicans in 2024 as part of their push to regain control of the House.

Ex-Rep. Mondaire Jones, who is openly gay and is running to retake his old seat held by Lawler, vowed to hold Lawler accountable for Johnson’s virulent anti-gay views, which could be controversial in the moderate suburban district.

“Absolutely despicable that Mike Lawler voted to make this man Speaker,” Jones tweeted.

Rep. Daniel Goldman (D-N.Y.) called Johnson dangerous because he joined Trump’s “Stop the Steal” effort and resisted the peaceful of transfer of power for the first time in American history.

“There’s nothing ‘moderate’ about these Republicans,” Goldman tweeted.

Rep. Pat Ryan won a Hudson Valley swing district on the back of outrage over the conservative Supreme Court’s decision reversing Roe v. Wade, which allows states and even the federal government to outlaw abortion.

Ryan called Johnson’s election a wake-up call for Democrats to vote against Republican congressional candidates in 2024 to protect women’s right to choose and gay marriage, which the Supreme Court decision has also left in danger.

“New Yorkers have rejected this far-right extremism before and they’ll do it again,” Ryan told the News."
