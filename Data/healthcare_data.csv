Oct 04 2022,Republicans offer a real healthcare alternative,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/community-family/republicans-offer-a-real-healthcare-alternative,"With their Commitment to America, Republicans have departed significantly from Democrats‘ big government agenda. Nowhere is that clearer than on healthcare.

Over the last few years, progressives have made clear their intention to replace the market-based healthcare system with a single, government-run insurance program. Republicans‘ Commitment to America, by contrast, seeks to improve the current system by introducing greater choice, transparency, and competition. That’s largely what the public wants from healthcare policy. A recent Echelon Insights poll sponsored by the organization I lead, the Pacific Research Institute, found that 86% of people are satisfied with their current health plan.

OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE LEGITIMATE SO LONG AS THE LEFT IS IN CHARGE

To the extent they are dissatisfied, the survey revealed that high premiums, deductibles, and copays — and overly restrictive access to doctors — are largely to blame. In other words, patients are looking for reforms that make the current system more affordable while removing the red tape that gets between them and their doctors. That’s what the GOP is pitching. Look at the recommendations of the party’s Healthy Future Task Force, which were released in June. Among other things, they propose to make coverage more portable and expand access to tax-advantaged health savings accounts.

The plan also includes strategies for improving price transparency, so patients can make informed decisions about how to spend their healthcare dollars. It even features creative strategies for injecting greater choice and competition into the marketplace, such as ending the moratorium on doctor-owned hospitals and giving states greater leeway over the kinds of health plans available to patients. This vision is animated by the recognition that America’s healthcare system provides the most innovative, highest-quality care on the planet. We should capitalize on that fact, not throw it away and install the kind of socialized healthcare that has failed patients the world over.

The Commitment to America goes a long way toward defining how Republicans differ from Democrats on healthcare. And it could give the GOP an advantage this November.

AUSTIN, Texas (KTRK) -- Five families and healthcare professionals are suing the state of Texas over its ban on what supporters call transgender care for children.

Senate Bill 14 was signed into law in June and goes into effect this fall. The bill opposes any efforts to validate transgender identities.

The lawsuit alleges the ban violates the Texas Constitution by allowing discrimination against a particular group based on sex and transgender identity.

But it's not just families on the lawsuit. Several doctors are joining, claiming that the law interferes with their license and ability to practice medicine.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says the puberty blockers and sex change procedures amount to child abuse.

Texas, which is home to one of the largest trans communities in the U.S., has joined 18 other states enacting this ban."
Jun 02 2023,South Carolina chips away at nanny-state healthcare,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/south-carolina-healthcare-certificate-of-need-henry-mcmaster-hospitals,"South Carolina healthcare providers no longer have to seek permission from the state government to offer new services, expand facilities, or invest in technology.

On May 17, Gov. Henry McMaster (R-SC) signed a repeal of the state’s certificate of need rules. A staple of healthcare regimes in many states, certificate of need laws require a hospital to get government permission before adding beds or a new wing, expanding their offices to include OBGYN services, or procuring ultrasound transducers, among others.

WHO’S IN, WHO’S OUT, AND WHO’S STILL WAITING TO ANNOUNCE FOR SENATE IN 2024

Certificate of need regulations were put in place by the federal government in the 1970s. The goal is to promote cost containment and prevent unnecessary duplication of healthcare facilities and services. But problems with these rules have been apparent almost from the start, with a growing list of bureaucratic rules quickly burdening hospitals, doctors, and other healthcare providers. By 1986, with evidence piling up showing certificate of need laws were ineffective, the federal government repealed the mandate.

In response, a handful of states did away with their certificate of need laws. But the bulk of states kept them in place. Today, 34 states and the District of Columbia still have certificate of need laws on the books, in full or in part. That’s necessary, say certificate of need supporters, because they help constrain healthcare costs and provide fairer access to facilities.

South Carolina’s repeal, though, highlights criticism of this approach, and it could be an inspiration to other states considering lifting certificate of need laws, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic in states where more significant percentages of the population live in rural areas.

According to the American Hospital Association, 136 rural hospitals closed between 2010 and 2021. Six of those hospitals were in South Carolina. To reverse this trend, and help rural hospitals achieve financial stability, the AHA called for “flexible models of care,” along with a “decreased regulatory burden,” among other solutions.

Moreover, states with certificate of need laws still on the books have a range of healthcare problems, according to a 2021 study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, including rising healthcare costs and fewer hospitals overall.

According to Mercatus, rural states with certificate of need laws have 13% fewer rural hospitals than those with such laws and 30% fewer hospitals overall for every 100,000 residents. A separate study found states with certificate of need laws have 99 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 people than those states without.

A Mercatus analysis found that South Carolina, by repealing its certificate of need laws, will increase the total number of hospitals from 82 to 116 and, perhaps more importantly, grow the number of rural hospitals in the state from 21 to 30. That would be a significant rise since eight Palmetto State counties out of 46 do not have a hospital.

State Sen. Wes Climer, the lead sponsor of the certificate of need repeal law, said in a statement it would have a prompt impact.

“Over the last, I think, five or six years, certificate of need has been used to block over $400 million in healthcare investment in South Carolina,” Climer said. “So, there’s a lot of pent-up demand for healthcare investment in our state.”

In a statement released after signing the bill, McMaster said, “South Carolinians will have greater access to affordable health care services with the repeal of the Certificate of Need laws. Everyone benefits when the proven power of the free market is unleashed in our state.”

The repeal of the certificate of need law in South Carolina represents a significant shift in the state’s healthcare policy. It’s one likely to appear more attractive to governors and legislators in other states as they evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of certificate of need laws.

The only other option is to continue living with laws that stifle innovation, expansion, and investment, which leads to fewer choices and lower quality of care for patients, critics say. Several states are considering proposals such as the South Carolina repeal law. If they follow through, proponents say the future of healthcare regulation in the United States is likely to prioritize market dynamics, consumer choice, and improved access to care."

May 19 2023,AG delays enforcement of OK transgender healthcare ban.,The Oklahoman,center,https://oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/government/2023/05/19/attorney-general-will-delay-enforcement-of-ban-on-transgender-health-care/70235137007,"Oklahoma's attorney general has agreed to delay enforcement of a new ban on transgender health care for minors while a preliminary hearing in a federal lawsuit is pending.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said the agreement ""simply allows more time to mount the strongest possible defense"" and ""should in no way be interpreted as a concession of any kind,"" according to a court motion and statement.

But the governor's office strongly rebuked Drummond's decision and vowed to halt all transgender surgeries for minors.

Drummond's agreement is ""disgusting and shameful,"" Gov. Kevin Stitt's communications director, Carly Atchison, tweeted Thursday evening shortly after the motion was filed in a Tulsa federal court.

Friday morning, during his weekly news conference, Stitt said he was ""disappointed and confused"" by Drummond's decision.

""Let me be very clear, Senate Bill 613 was passed, I signed it, and I will not allow transgender surgeries to happen to minors in the state of Oklahoma,"" Stitt said. ""I just think we have an obligation or duty to protect young people.""

Earlier this month, Stitt signed Senate Bill 613, which immediately banned gender transition surgeries, along with a six-month phase-out of other drug and hormone treatments.

Stitt acknowledged ""maybe there's a legal argument"" for Drummond's decision. But he continued to wrongly accuse the attorney general of agreeing with the lawsuit.

""We knew (the) ACLU is going to sue on anything that is (for) traditional family values or freedoms or, you know, anything that we're for they're against,"" Stitt said. ""So we knew we'd get sued on that and (for Drummond) to agree with that lawsuit ... is super disappointing.""

Asked to respond to Stitt's comments, Drummond's office reiterated that delaying enforcement was a legal strategy and not an agreement with the lawsuit.

“The attorney general’s office continues to fulfill its duty to defend Senate Bill 613. A temporary stay of enforcement simply allows more time to mount the strongest possible defense,"" Drummond's office said in an emailed statement.

The ACLU of Oklahoma, which is representing multiple Oklahoma families in the lawsuit, said the delayed enforcement agreement allows families to still access important health care services.

“We welcome this opportunity to preserve the rights of transgender adolescents and their families to access medically necessary health care while our challenge proceeds,"" the ACLU said Thursday in a joint statement with other attorneys representing the plaintiffs.

Five Oklahoma transgender youths and their families, along with an Oklahoma doctor, sued the state over the ban, claiming their ability to make their own health care decisions allowed youth to flourish in life.

The attorney general's agreement to delay enforcement was announced Thursday in a joint motion filed in a Tulsa federal court. The motion also requested more time for the defendants in the case to file a response before a preliminary hearing."

Jun 20 2023,US judge nixes Arkansas’s ban on transgender healthcare for youth,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2023/6/21/us-judge-nixes-arkansass-ban-on-transgender-healthcare-for-youth,"The Arkansas ban was the first of its kind in the US, paving the way for at least 19 other states to restrict such care.

A federal judge in the United States has struck down Arkansas’s first-in-the-nation ban on gender-affirming care for children, the first ruling to overturn such a prohibition as a growing number of Republican-led states adopt similar restrictions.

US District Judge Jay Moody issued a permanent injunction against the Arkansas law, which would have prohibited doctors from providing gender-affirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18.

The Arkansas law, which Moody temporarily blocked in 2021, also would have prohibited doctors from referring patients elsewhere for such care. In the wake of its passage, at least 19 other states have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors and nearly all of them have been challenged in court.

In his order, Moody ruled the prohibition violated the due process and equal protection rights of transgender youth and families. He said the law also violated the First Amendment rights of medical providers.

“Rather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence showed that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of patients and that, by prohibiting it, the state undermined the interests it claims to be advancing,” Moody wrote in his ruling.

Moody’s ruling echoed remarks judges have made in other decisions temporarily blocking similar bans in Alabama and Indiana.

Republican Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement that he planned to appeal Moody’s ruling to the 8th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the judge’s temporary order against the law last year.

Griffin said he was disappointed in the ruling, denouncing the health care as “experimentation”, an argument the judge’s ruling said was refuted by decades of clinical experience and scientific research.

Republican legislators in Arkansas enacted the ban in 2021, overriding a veto by former Governor Asa Hutchinson. The law went too far by cutting off treatments for children currently receiving care, Hutchinson argued. He has since left office and is now seeking the Republican presidential nomination.

The ruling affects only the Arkansas ban but may carry implications for the fates of similar prohibitions or discourage attempts to enact them in other states.

“This decision sends a clear message. Fear-mongering and misinformation about this health care do not hold up to scrutiny; it hurts trans youth and must end,” said Holly Dickson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Arkansas. “Science, medicine, and law are clear: Gender-affirming care is necessary to ensure these young Arkansans can thrive and be healthy.”

The ACLU challenged the law on behalf of four transgender youths, their families and two doctors.

The ruling comes as even more states are poised to enact bans on care for transgender youth. Louisiana’s Democratic governor has said he intends to veto a similar prohibition, though the state’s Republican legislature likely has the votes needed to override him. Proposed bans are also pending in legislatures in North Carolina and Ohio.

Three states have banned or restricted the care through regulations or administrative orders.

Florida’s law goes beyond banning the treatments for youth by also prohibiting the use of state money for gender-affirming care and placing new restrictions on adults seeking treatment. A federal judge has blocked Florida from enforcing its ban on three children who have challenged the law.

Children’s hospitals around the country have faced harassment and threats of violence for providing such care.

The state has argued the prohibition is within its authority to regulate the medical profession. People opposed to such treatments for children argue they are too young to make such decisions about their futures.

However, major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans. Experts say the treatments are safe if properly administered.

Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Hutchinson’s successor, signed legislation in March attempting to effectively reinstate Arkansas’s ban by making it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming care for children. That law does not take effect until later this summer.

Sanders on Tuesday called the care “activists pushing a political agenda at the expense of our kids”.

“Only in the far-Left’s woke vision of America is it not appropriate to protect children,” Sanders tweeted.

Tuesday’s court decision came after a roughly two-week trial, including testimony from one of the transgender youths challenging the state’s ban. Dylan Brandt, 17, also testified in October that the hormone therapy he received has transformed his life and the ban would force him to leave the state.

“I’m so grateful the judge heard my experience of how this health care has changed my life for the better and saw the dangerous impact this law could have on my life and that of countless other transgender people,” Brandt said in a statement released by the ACLU.

Sabrina Jennen, another of the transgender youth who sued over the ban, said she felt a “wave of relief” over the ruling.

“I can say with 100 percent certainty that if I hadn’t had this care, I would not be here today or at least in such a stable, mental state as happy as I am and as thriving as I am,” Jennen, 17, told The Associated Press. “Having this care, it truly lifted me up from the deepest, darkest place.”"
Apr 29 2023,Montana governor signs ban on gender-affirming healthcare,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/04/29/montana-greg-gianforte-zooey-zephyr-trans-healthcare,"A ban on gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth has been officially signed into Montana law just days after state officials censured its only trans politician.

Republican Montana governor Greg Gianforte signed the highly controversial Senate Bill 99 into law on Friday (28 April) after it passed the final hurdle in a House vote earlier this month.

The bill, also known as the Provide for a Youth Health Protection Act, aims to halt gender-affirming care for under-18s by preventing access to physically reversible puberty blockers.

It also bans “surgical procedures,” which no private or public healthcare system currently practices on under-18s.

Gianforte’s signing of SB99 came amid protests in Missoula, Montana by LGBTQ+ activists calling for the government to rescind its censure of politician Zooey Zephyr.

Prior to the bill’s final vote, the state’s only trans representative urged lawmakers to reconsider their approval of the law in a powerful speech where she accused anti-trans lawmakers of having “blood on their hands”.

You may like to watch

“If you disallow the use of the medical care that is accepted by every major medical association … the only therapy left is either meaningless, or conversion therapy, which is torture.”

""If you are denying gender-affirming care and forcing a trans child to go through puberty, that is tantamount to torture, and this body should be ashamed.



If you vote yes on this bill, I hope the next time you bow your heads in prayer, you see the blood on your hands."" pic.twitter.com/WnxvmQtFCt — Rep. Zooey Zephyr (@ZoAndBehold) April 18, 2023

She was reprimanded for her speech days later by House speaker Matt Regier, who said he refuses to acknowledge her during floor debates going forward unless she apologises for the speech.

As a result, activists protested in the observation deck of Montana’s state capitol, chanting to “let her speak” as riot police attempted to disperse the crowd, arresting seven of the protestors.

The controversy culminated in a House vote to effectively ban Zephyr from House debates entirely.

Lawmakers approved an order that means Zephyr is no longer able to speak during House floor debates, or participate in House business for the remainder of the 2023 legislative session.

In a statement following the vote, she wrote: “Though the Republican supermajority has voted to strip me of my ability to partake in debate, I remain steadfast in my commitment to my community.

“I will continue to make the difficult moral choices necessary to stand up for the people who entrusted me with their representation. My gratitude for those who spoke out on these principles is boundless, and I pledge to always stand up for them.”

Montana governor’s non-binary child lobbies to reject anti-trans bills.

Zephyr wasn’t alone in pushing back against the anti-trans bill and so many others like it. Greg Gianforte’s non-binary child urged the governor to reconsider his signing of the bill.

David Gianforte told the Montana Free Press that they felt an obligation to stand up for LGBTQ+ people in the state following the passing of the bill.

“There are a lot of important issues passing through the legislature right now,” they said. “For my own sake, I’ve chosen to focus primarily on transgender rights, as that would significantly directly affect a number of my friends.

“I would like to make the argument that these bills are immoral, unjust, and frankly a violation of human rights.”

Despite their best efforts, David admitted that they didn’t expect the bill’s outcome to be altered, but hoped that their words would inspire change in the future.

“I feel like I have a voice and I can be heard, and I feel, not only in communicating with my father, that’s not necessarily the main point, but also just showing support for the transgender community in Montana.

“I think that could be meaningful, especially at this time.”

The governor responded by asking David “when can we get together and talk about it?” shortly before signing the bill."
Jun 03 2023,Texas governor signs bill banning transgender youth healthcare,Washington Blade,left,https://washingtonblade.com/2023/06/03/texas-governor-signs-bill-banning-transgender-youth-healthcare,"By Alex Nguyen and William Melhado | Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law Friday a bill that bars transgender kids from getting puberty blockers and hormone therapies, though the new law could face legal challenges before it takes effect on Sept. 1.

Senate Bill 14’s passage brings to the finish line a legislative priority for the Republican Party of Texas, which opposes any efforts to validate transgender identities. Trans kids, their parents and LGBTQ advocacy groups fiercely oppose the law, and some have vowed to stop it from going into effect.

Texas — home to one of the largest trans communities in the U.S. — is now one of over a dozen states that restrict transition-related care for trans minors.

“Cruelty has always been the point,” said Emmett Schelling, executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas. “It’s not shocking that this governor would sign SB14 right at the beginning of Pride [month]; however this will not stop trans people from continuing to exist with authenticity — as we always have.”

Authored by New Braunfels Republican state Sen. Donna Campbell, the law bars trans kids from getting puberty blockers and hormone therapies, treatments many medical groups support. Children already receiving these treatments will have to be “weaned off” in a “medically appropriate” manner. The law also bans transition-related surgeries for kids, though those are rarely performed on minors.

Those who support the law claim that health care providers have capitalized on a “social contagion” to misguide parents and push life-altering treatments on kids who may later regret their decisions. SB 14’s supporters have also disputed the science and research behind transition-related care.

But trans kids, their parents and major medical groups say these medical treatments are important to protecting the mental health of an already vulnerable population, which faces a higher risk of depression and suicide than their cisgender peers. At the same time, doctors say cutting off these treatments — gradually or abruptly — could bring both physical discomfort and psychological distress to trans youth, some of whom have called it forced detransitioning.

In response, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Texas, Lambda Legal and the Transgender Law Center pledged on May 18 to fight SB 14 in court. They have yet to file a lawsuit.

“Transgender people have always been here and will always be here,” Ash Hall, policy and advocacy strategist at the ACLU of Texas, said Friday. “Our trans youth deserve a world where they can shine alongside their peers, and we will keep advocating for that world in and out of the courts.”

This legal threat is not new; some of these groups have sued several other states over their restrictions. Earlier this year, the Department of Justice also joined the legal fight against Tennessee’s ban.

While the lawsuits are tailored to each state, Sasha Buchert, a senior attorney at Lambda Legal and the director of its Nonbinary and Transgender Rights Project, told the Texas Tribune last month that a major common challenge to the laws hinges on the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause and the argument that these laws are stopping trans kids from accessing the same medical treatments that are still available to their cisgender peers.

Buchert added that the lawsuits’ immediate goal is generally to get a preliminary injunction to stop these laws from taking effect, a tactic that has seen some success.

“It’s one thing to see some of the things that state legislators do, but it’s a completely different thing when you’re under the white-hot spotlight of judicial scrutiny,” she said.

And prior to SB 14, the ACLU and Lambda Legal successfully sued Texas last year to halt state-ordered child abuse investigations of parents who provide their trans kids with access to transition-related care. Impeached Attorney General Ken Paxton later appealed the decision in March, but the 3rd Court of Appeals has yet to issue a ruling on it.

“It’s a privilege to be able to fight,” Buchert said about the ongoing court challenges that Lambda Legal is involved in.

Editor’s note:

In a late Friday evening phone call, Landon Richie, with the Transgender Education Network of Texas, told the Washington Blade:

“Today Governor Abbott signed cruelty into law. Legislation that purports to ‘protect youth’ while stripping them of the life-saving, life-giving care that they receive will cost lives, and that’s not an exaggeration. Trans kids deserve not only to exist, but to thrive as their authentic selves in every facet of their lives, and we will never stop fighting to to actualize a world where that is undisputed. Despite efforts by our state, trans people will always exist in Texas, as we always have, and we will continue to exist brilliantly and boldly, and with endless care for one another.”

May 25 2023,Bill to ban healthcare for transgender youth defeated in La. Senate,Washington Blade,left,https://washingtonblade.com/2023/05/25/bill-to-ban-healthcare-for-transgender-youth-defeated-in-la-senate,"The American Civil Liberties Union and the ACLU of Louisiana on Wednesday asked a federal court to order the release of a lesbian mother from El Salvador who has been in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody since June 2017

The writ for habeas corpus petition the ACLU filed in U.S. District for the Western District of Louisiana in Lafayette, La., on Jessica Patricia Barahona-Martinez’s behalf notes she and her three children entered the U.S. on May 31, 2016, “fleeing persecution she faced in El Salvador as a lesbian, and because the government had falsely identified her as a gang member.”

ICE released her “under conditions of supervision” and she “complied with these conditions for more than a year.”

ACLU Staff Attorney My Khanh Ngo on Thursday told the Washington Blade during a telephone interview that Barahona-Martinez, 40, was living with her sister and other family members in Woodbridge, Va., when ICE arrested and detained her on June 26, 2017.

“The sole reason for her arrest and detention was an Interpol Red Notice that was based on a Salvadoran warrant related to a charge of aggravated extortion for up to $30 — a charge for which she had initially been acquitted,” reads her petition.

She was at the Virginia Peninsula Regional Jail in Williamsburg, Va., before ICE transferred her to the Caroline Detention Facility in Bowling Green, Va., in October 2018. Barahona-Martinez arrived at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, a privately-run detention center the GEO Group, a Florida-based company, operates in Basile, La., in October 2020.

Barahona-Martinez’s petition notes an immigration judge has granted her asylum twice, most recently in November 2019, “on the grounds that she faces persecution on account of her sexual orientation.” The government appealed and the Board of Immigration Appeals, which the Justice Department oversees, ruled in their favor.

“In sustaining the government’s appeal of that grant, the Board of Immigration Appeals (‘BIA’ or ‘board’) did not address the merits of her asylum claim,” reads Barahona-Martinez’s petition. “Instead, in a two-to-one decision, over a strong dissent, it held that petitioner was ineligible for asylum under the ‘serious nonpolitical crime’ bar. The majority relied on the then-pending Interpol Red Notice and the Salvadoran warrant to find there were ‘serious reasons’ for believing she had committed such a crime. The dissenting Board member pointed out that petitioner had not only been acquitted of the alleged offense once, but had also submitted credible evidence to back up her claim of innocence.”

Her petition notes she appealed the Board of Immigration Appeals’ decision to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., “which granted her a stay of removal pending appeal, reflecting it assessment of the likelihood of her success on the merits of her appeal.” Her petition further indicates the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files, an independent body that oversees whether Interpol properly processes personal data, in April “permanently deleted the Interpol Red Notice that had been lodged against Ms. Barahona-Martinez” after her new lawyer made the request.

“Her pro bono counsel has since filed a motion to reopen proceedings before the BIA on this ground, as it is relevant to the board’s analysis of whether the serious nonpolitical crime bar applies to petitioner’s case and renders her ineligible for asylum,” reads the petition. “The government has agreed to hold her appeal in abeyance in light of the pending motion to reopen, yet ICE continues to detain Ms. Barahona-Martinez as her removal proceedings continue.”

U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) in June 2020 told the Blade that detainees at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center did not have access to toilet paper or soap for nine days. The Illinois Democrat also said staff were not required to wear masks and they did not implement social distancing policies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Ngo said Barahona-Martinez is at increased risk for COVID-19 because she has asthma.

Ngo said a doctor gave Barahona-Martinez Tylenol when she showed COVID-19 symptoms, “and unsurprisingly she got extremely sick.” Ngo told the Blade that Barahona-Martinez a few weeks ago went to the emergency room because of “excruciating stomach pain.”

“It’s clear that she’s been deteriorating in detention, both physically and mentally,” said Ngo.

Ngo told the Blade that Barahona-Martinez’s asthma has become worse since arrived in Louisiana, and suffers panic attacks nearly every day. Ngo said the only way that Barahona-Martinez can “get back into a mental state that will keep her going” is by talking with her family.

“The food is rotten. She is afraid because she is gay in attention. She’s been harassed and threatened by both officers and other detainees because of her sexual orientation,” said Ngo. “She doesn’t feel safe there at all. She tries to keep to herself.”

Ngo said Barahona-Martinez works up to five hours a day in the facility’s kitchen. She earns around $3 a day.

Transgender woman murdered after US deported her to El Salvador

Discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity remains commonplace in El Salvador.

A court in San Salvador, the country’s capital, in 2020 sentenced three police officers to 20 years in prison for the murder of Camila Díaz Córdova, a transgender woman.

Díaz asked for asylum in the U.S. because of violence against LGBTQ and intersex Salvadorans. The U.S. deported her in 2017, and her friend reported her missing at the end of January 2019. Díaz died at a San Salvador hospital on Feb. 3, 2019.

Barahona-Martinez is from San Salvador.

President Nayib Bukele in March 2022 declared a state of emergency that allowed his government to crackdown on rampant gang violence.

The Associated Press in July reported Salvadoran authorities have detained upwards of 70,000 people. Human Rights Watch and other groups say arbitrary arrests, torture of detainees and other human rights abuses have taken place since the crackdown began.

“The situation in El Salvador is much worse,” Ngo told the Blade. “It was bad in 2016 when she [Barahona-Martinez] fled, but with the state of emergency that’s in place right now, there’s been a lot of reporting about how much worse conditions are in the prisons against people who are accused of being with the gangs. There’s a lot of arbitrary detentions and killings and abuses.”

Ngo said Salvadoran authorities tortured Barahona-Martinez after they arrested her. Ngo said her former criminal defense attorney told her that Barahona-Martinez would be “in danger if she were returned” to El Salvador.

“She said, as much as possible, please keep her in the United States,” said Ngo. “She was known as a lesbian back then. It’s clear coming back they would know that she had applied for asylum in the United States and there’s the potential retaliation for that. She’s really risking her life if she’s sent back there.”

A billboard in San Salvador, El Salvador, on July 23, 2019, advises Salvadorans “not to lose your life in the gangs. It is easy to join, but the only way out is jail or death.” Gang violence has prompted tens of thousands of migrants from El Salvador and neighboring Honduras to seek refuge in the U.S. in recent years.

Barahona-Martinez’s petition names Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and South Louisiana ICE Processing Center Warden Eleazar Garcia are among those named as defendants.

ICE and the Department of Homeland Security have not responded to the Blade’s request for comment.

Barahona-Martinez, for her part, says she simply wants to be reunited with her children.

“I always think back on that day in 2017 when I was arrested by ICE and taken away from my children. They were so young at that time. I never thought that I would still be in detention six years later. I have missed so many of their birthdays, graduations, and other big life events,” she said in a statement to the ACLU. “Being separated from my children for this long has been so difficult, but I am fighting for a future here with them. All I want is the chance to show a judge why we should be reunited.”"

The left views both Biden’s and Sanders’s plans favorably, and opposes repealing the Cadillac tax.

“Both Biden and his more progressive rivals are somewhat downplaying exactly how much more left wing than the ACA [his] idea is… The main difference between Biden’s plan and Medicare-for-all is a BidenCare transition that would be more gradual and much less costly in terms of explicit tax increases… make no mistake, if it were somehow to happen, it would be a really big deal.”

Matthew Yglesias, Vox

At the same time, many argue that “this is one issue where Obama nostalgia may fall short with the voters Biden needs to reach. For many Democrats, ObamaCare was a good first step, establishing the idea that the federal government has an important role to play in ensuring Americans have access to adequate insurance and care. But they also considered the law flawed — too reliant on profit-seeking private insurance companies, too derivative of Republican approaches to the issue, too much the result of the political compromises it took to get passed. For such activists, ObamaCare is the clunker they drive to work; Medicare-for-all — or something like it — is the shiny, sleek sports car they want to own someday.”

Joel Mathis, The Week

“Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.) said, let’s ‘keep what’s working’ in our current system. What does that mean? Today, millions of Americans remain uninsured or underinsured — with exorbitant deductibles and out-of-pocket costs on top of their ever-rising insurance premiums. Medical bankruptcy is common, even among the insured… And people with employer-sponsored private insurance? They lack health-care security. If they lose their job, they lose their insurance. If ‘working’ means decent and reliable coverage, private health insurance is definitely not cutting it…



“Beto O’Rourke said ‘Choice is fundamental’ as an argument to retain commercial insurance. Yet it is our choice of doctor (not insurance company) that is fundamental to our care and that’s exactly the freedom that commercial insurance denies us — for profit.”

Dr. James G. Kahn and Elliot Marseille, The Hill

While “[public] support drops dramatically… once you explain that [Medicare for All] would force them to swap their current insurance for a public plan… It is not entirely clear why this is the case, since few people really seem to be in love with their insurance company. Some surveys have found that enthusiasm for Medicare for All bounces back up if pollsters explain that, while private carriers would disappear, people would still be able to keep their doctors. That suggests some Americans are actually worried about losing their favorite physician, not their Cigna card.”

Jordan Weissman, Slate

“More than 100 rural hospitals across the nation have closed in recent years, leaving many poor communities bereft of access to even basic health-care services. From 2004 to 2014, some 650,000 women of childbearing age in rural counties lost all access to obstetric services… Meanwhile, even as some hospitals close, others are seeing rising profits, or embarking on aggressive capital expansions and acquisitions, propelled by fierce competition. Fancy new towers rise as rural hospitals fall, yet both have a common cause. The poverty of some of our hospitals and the rich fortunes of others are but two manifestations of a single pathology: a dysfunctional, profit-oriented system of hospital payment…



“How would things be different with Medicare for All? Well… there [would be] no hospital profits, and so profitability ceases to be the criterion that dictates which hospitals open or close, and which expand and beautify. It would remove the incentive for hospitals to chase lucrative service lines, like spinal surgery, at the expense of unprofitable ones, like mental health. And it would ensure that we have hospitals, obstetric units, and mental health wards in the communities that need them—not just where firms think that they will be profitable.”

Jun 22 2023,"Arkansas ban on trans healthcare violates US constitution, judge rules",PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/06/22/arkansas-gender-affirming-care,"A US federal judge has struck down a ban on gender-affirming care for trans-under-18s in Arkansas after deeming it unconstitutional.

US district judge Jay Moody Issued an indefinite injunction against the Republican-led House Bill 1570 (HB1570) on Tuesday (20 June) after deeming it in violation of the equal protection rights of trans youth.

Similar to several other bills proposed across US legislatures, the bill would have banned gender-affirming care for under-18s, including physically reversible puberty blockers.

It would have imposed sanctions on medical organisations and professionals that prescribed the treatment to under-18s.

The bill also banned gender-affirming surgeries, which have never been performed by private or public medical associations for under-15s.

“Rather than protecting children or safeguarding medical ethics, the evidence shows that the prohibited medical care improves the mental health and well-being of patients and that, by prohibiting it, the state undermined the interests it claims to be advancing,” Moody wrote in his ruling.

The federal judge temporarily blocked HB1570 in 2021 after finding that the ban would have caused “irreparable harm” to those who seek care.

His latest ruling on the Arkansas bill remarked that similar injunctions had been made in Alabama and Indiana.

He also cited testimony from gender dysphoria psychiatrist Dr Dan Karasic, who said that gender-affirming care is not just vital, it’s life-saving.

“Delaying gender-affirming medical care when indicated puts patients at risk of worsening anxiety, depression, hospitalisation and suicidality,” Karasic said.

“Not all adolescents with gender dysphoria will live to age 18 if they are unable to get gender-affirming medical treatment.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which brought the legal action in Arkansas that resulted in the injunction, applauded the ruling opinion.

‘Trans futures threatened by laws like this one’

ACLU executive director, Holly Dickson, said: “This decision sends a clear message. Fear-mongering and misinformation about this health care do not hold up to scrutiny; it hurts trans youth and must end.

“Science, medicine, and law are clear: gender-affirming care is necessary to ensure these young Arkansans can thrive and be healthy.”

17-year-old trans boy Dylan Brandt, who was represented by the ACLU during trial, also commended the decision.

He said that he was grateful that the judge had listened to his experiences and made a decision based on how gender-affirming healthcare had changed his and so many others’ lives.

“My mom and I wanted to fight this law not just to protect my health care, but also to ensure that transgender people like me can safely and fully live our truths,” he continued.

“Transgender kids across the country are having their own futures threatened by laws like this one, and it’s up to all of us to speak out, fight back, and give them hope.”

The ACLU is currently tracking at least 130 bills that attempt to mitigate LGBTQ+ healthcare in some fashion.

In total, it has found 491 anti-LGBTQ+ bills, many of which are currently advancing through state legislation and could have profoundly negative effects on the community."
Sep 27 2023,Montana judge blocks ban on gender transition healthcare to minors four days before law takes effect,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/montana-judge-blocks-gender-transition-health-care-ban,"A Montana judge has blocked the enforcement of a ban on gender transition medical care for minors, citing multiple violations of the state constitution. The law was set to go into effect on Oct. 1.

District Court Judge Jason Marks ruled in favor of transgender youth, healthcare providers, and activists who argued that the ban on gender transition care is unconstitutional and would harm the mental and physical health of youth.

UAW STRIKE: FOUR-DAY WORKWEEK FAVORED BY UNION GAINING IN POPULARITY

Marks’s ruling places a preliminary injunction on the ban until a full trial can be held on the issue, according to the Associated Press. The judge said he expects his ruling will be appealed to the Montana Supreme Court.

“Today’s ruling permits our clients to breathe a sigh of relief,” Akilah Deernose, executive director of the ACLU of Montana, said in a statement. “But this fight is far from over. We look forward to vindicating our clients’ constitutional rights and ensuring that this hateful law never takes effect.”

The law, set to go into effect in four days, would have prohibited the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgical treatment for gender dysphoria, a term used to describe the conflict between the gender assigned at birth and the desired identifying gender.

Gov. Greg Gianforte (R-MT) signed the bill into effect in April after introducing amendments to make it clear that public funds would not be used to pay for gender transition surgeries or care.

The bill “protects Montana children from permanent, life-altering medical procedures until they are adults, mature enough to make such serious decisions,” Gianforte wrote in a letter accompanying the amendments.

Transgender youth and advocates argued that the law would violate their rights to equal protection, the right to seek health, and the right to dignity. Parents of transgender youth said the state’s law, passed during the Montana Legislature’s 2023 legislative session, would violate their constitutional rights to make medical decisions for their children.

The American Civil Liberties Union argued in its complaint that the treatments for gender transition surgeries and care have been approved by major U.S. medical organizations, such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“Montana’s ban is a direct assault on the freedom and well-being of transgender youth, their families, and their medical providers,” Malita Picasso, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberty Union, said in a previous statement.

Montana is one of 22 states that have taken steps to enact bans on gender transition surgeries or healthcare for minors, with several of those states facing lawsuits from the ACLU or other civil rights organizations. Some of the bans have been blocked by courts, such as in Texas and Arkansas, while others have taken effect in other states like Missouri.

A study from Columbia University released in August found that gender transition surgeries in the United States nearly tripled from 2016 to 2019 before dropping in 2020. However, the study found that gender transition procedures are rare for minors, with fewer than 3,700 performed on U.S. patients ages 12 to 18 during that same time frame."
Aug 22 2023,Georgia judge issues temporary block on gender-affirming healthcare ban: 'An incredible victory',PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/08/22/georgia-trans-healthcare-ban-overturned,"A federal judge has issued a temporary block on a policy that seeks to ban the provision of gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth across the US state of Georgia.

In an 83-page order, district judge Sarah Geraghty ruled that Georgia’s law, passed last month, that prohibits licensed medical professionals from providing patients under 18 with hormone therapy, was “likely” to be unconstitutional.

The preliminary order was issued on Sunday, preventing Senate Bill 140 from being issued while a case – filed by four families alongside TransParent, an organisation representing parents with transgender children – was heard.

Elsewhere, courts in Arkansas, Indiana, Alabama, Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee have blocked bans on similar policies, although in the last two of those states that has now been reversed on appeal. Meanwhile, the ban in Arkansas was overturned in June after being found to be in violation of the First Amendment and the constitution’s clauses on equal protection and due process.

“This decision is an incredible victory for Georgia families,” The Advocate reported the plaintiffs’ counsel as saying. “We are gratified that the court carefully considered the evidence and appropriately applied the law.

“This law unapologetically targets transgender minors and denies them essential health care. The ruling restores parents’ rights to make medical decisions that are in their child’s best interest, including hormone therapy for their transgender children when needed for them to thrive and be healthy.

“Using hormone therapy to treat transgender youth when it is medically necessary is supported by every major medical organisation in the country. Indeed, the court found that the ban would be likely to put some individuals at risk of the serious harms associated with gender dysphoria that gender-affirming care seeks to prevent.”

In March, officials in Houston County in Georgia allegedly spent at least $1.2 million (approximately £942,000) to avoid picking up the bill for a transgender woman’s gender-affirming healthcare, despite claims that the care itself was too expensive for the state to cover.

The care was proposed for deputy sheriff Anna Lange, who requested gender-affirming surgery under her insurance plan after she came out to her colleagues in 2017. The cost of the treatment she requested equated to about two per cent – roughly $25,600 (£20,100) – of what the state spent on lawyers opposing her claim.

“The sheriff might not endorse my transition, but as long as I work hard for him and maintain a high level of efficiency for Houston County, that’s what is most important”, she told a meeting of the board of commissioners in 2019.

“I pay the same taxes and premiums as every other Houston County citizen, yet I do not receive equal coverage in medical care.”"
Jun 29 2023,CEO of healthcare company reflects on how Affirmative Action changed his life,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/affirmative-action-supreme-court-decision-philadelphia-joe-watkins,"PHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- A divided Supreme Court has struck down Affirmative Action in college admissions. The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that colleges can no longer take race into consideration.

With that decision, some are looking back at how the policy helped them achieve their goals of higher education.

As Joe Watkins flips through photo albums filled with past memories of his college career, he can't help but reflect on how he says Affirmative Action changed his life.

""With the help of Affirmative Action and people who wanted to level the playing field I got a scholarship,"" Watkins, a former White House aide, said.

It was a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania where Watkins not only ran track and field but also was on the basketball team.

After that, Watkins continued learning at Princeton Theological Seminary.

But even before reaching higher education, Watkins was the second highest-performing student in his predominantly White high school.

""Even with great scores, I wasn't assured I'd be admitted to any college that I had applied to, which is a sad thing when you consider it, and so, that's how hard it was just a few, couple of decades ago,"" Watkins said.

Those challenges didn't stop him from accomplishing a long resume that includes being an aide to President George H.W. Bush., a TV political commentator and now a CEO of his own healthcare company.

Watkins says Thursday's Supreme Court decision to end Affirmative Action is a step backward.

""I'm not surprised by the decision, but that shouldn't diminish its impact to people of color, our colleges and universities should reflect our population,"" Watkins said.

Watkins says that the future population's opportunity when it comes to accessing higher education is now in the hands of each individual college and university.

""Time will tell whether or not schools themselves will do the right thing and fight for what's best for everybody,"" Watkins said.

Watkins hopes the policy reversal, rather than dissuading students, empowers them to further fight for their future just like he did."
May 18 2023,Texas’ Crusade Against Trans Kids Continues With Youth Healthcare Ban,Them,left,https://them.us/story/texas-trans-youth-healthcare-ban,"Texas legislators have passed a ban on gender-affirming care for minors in the state, sending the controversial bill to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott for final approval.

On Wednesday, the Texas Senate voted 19-12 in favor of Senate Bill 14, which would ban any Texan under 18 from receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they are used to “transition a child ’s biological sex.” Minors currently receiving such care would be required to “wean off” their treatment under a doctor’s supervision.

The bill also bans gender-affirming surgeries on minors, which only occurs in extremely rare cases, while carving out exceptions for intersex children who do not have “normal” chromosomal or physical development. Public funds, including Medicaid, would be barred from covering such care, and doctors who provide it to minor patients could be stripped of their medical licenses altogether.

The Texas House also voted in favor of SB 14 on Monday by a vote of 87-56. Two members, Republican Speaker Dade Phelan and Democrat Barbara Gervin-Hawkins, voted “present.”

The measure now heads to Gov. Abbott’s desk, who is widely expected to sign it, having spearheaded Texas’ crusade against trans youth since signing a sports ban for trans youth in 2021 and ordering investigations as to whether gender-affirming care is “child abuse” last year. Earlier this month, Texas police broke up a “sing-in” by trans and racial justice protestors who occupied Abbott’s office, arresting at least two people and banning another from the state capitol building for a full year.

Nineteen U.S. states including Texas currently have laws or executive-level rules that prohibit gender-affirming care for minors, according to data collected by the Human Rights Campaign. About 30% of trans youth currently live in a state that legally denies them gender-affirming medical care.

Texas Police Forcibly Detained LGBTQ+ Protestors During a Debate Over Anti-Trans Law SB 14 would bar minors in Texas from receiving gender-affirming medical care.

“I am a really happy kid, and I have a really positive outlook on life, [but SB 14] would push me past my breaking point,” one trans teen told the Texas Tribune earlier this month.

“It’s not ‘over my dead body’ because that would just be letting them win,” he continued. “I’m not going to be another statistic.”

On Thursday, legal advocacy groups including Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Texas, and Transgender Law Center announced in a press release they would file a federal lawsuit challenging SB 14 should it receive Gov. Abbott’s signature.

Texas lawmakers are “hellbent on joining the growing roster of states determined to jeopardize the health and lives of transgender youth,” the organizations wrote in their statement.

“We will defend the rights of transgender youth in court, just as we have done in other states engaging in this anti-science and discriminatory fear-mongering.”

The Writers Guild of America has gone on strike against major Hollywood studios after both parties were unable to agree on a new contract. Picketing started Tuesday afternoon in New York and L.A.

SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:

Many of the most popular late-night shows on TV...

(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)

UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: From Hollywood, it's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""

JIMMY FALLON: Welcome, welcome, welcome to ""The Tonight Show."" You are here.

(CHEERING)

SETH MYERS: And that's a joke for old people. We did it.

STEPHEN COLBERT: They've created something called the Colbert Questionnaire, which is...

(CHEERING)

PFEIFFER: ...Are set to go dark tonight. That's because the Writers Guild of America - the people who write these shows - continues to strike. ""The Late Night Show With Stephen Colbert"" (ph), ""Late Night With Seth Meyers,"" ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" will all be in reruns for now. The writers say they're striking for higher wages and better health care. The last Writers Guild strike started in 2007 and lasted 100 days. NPR's culture correspondent Mandalit del Barco is at one site where there's picketing, and she joins us now live. Hi, Mandalit.

MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Hi, how are you?

PFEIFFER: Good. Where are you, and what's happening where you are?

DEL BARCO: Well, I'm here in Hollywood, outside Netflix, which is one of the studios that is part of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. That's the group that's been negotiating with the WGA. There's a group of writers here who are chanting and holding picket signs that say things like - why don't you try to write a script? - and also - don't you want to see how ""The Last Of Us"" ends? - referencing...

(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING)

DEL BARCO: ...To the HBO series. You can now hear the cars honking as they go by.

PFEIFFER: (Laughter).

DEL BARCO: There are other picket lines outside the major studios around town - Disney, Amazon, Warner Brothers, NBCUniversal, Paramount and Sony. Writers are also picketing in New York. And actors and directors and people behind the scenes may be joining these lines since their unions have been supportive of the WGA writers. This strike means production in Hollywood is expected to stop.

PFEIFFER: Mandalit, we mentioned that the writers are asking for higher pay. They especially want that because streaming services have taken over the media landscape and changed how they've paid - to the negative. Can you tell us what else they want in their new contract?

(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING)

DEL BARCO: Well, writers say they're now in an existential crisis, with half of them working at the union's minimum wage. The writers say the companies are making so much money from their work and not sharing the profits with them fairly. The streamers, for example, are ordering fewer episodes each season for them to write. Writers say they're being paid very, very little for residuals when streamers rerun their work. I talked to one writer who is on the WGA negotiating team, Danielle Sanchez-Witzel. And until last night, she was working here at Netflix on an upcoming show called ""Survival Of The Thickest.""

DANIELLE SANCHEZ-WITZEL: Studios are trying to pay us as little as possible for the least amount of time as possible. And we're here to say that's not how we make the movies and the television that - you know, that audiences watch, that they sell and that they make billions of dollars off of.

(SOUNDBITE OF HORN HONKING)

DEL BARCO: Danielle and the other writers say they've become gig workers, worried about their next jobs. And they don't like having to write in what are called mini rooms, working on spec, often at minimum pay, on scripts that may or may not get the green light. And writers complained that these mini rooms are often understaffed, and there's no guarantee that the people in them will get to stay on them as writers, even if the show gets picked up. One other concern, though, is the use of artificial intelligence in writing screenplays and scripts. The writers want to make sure their intellectual property is protected.

PFEIFFER: They're striking because they weren't able to successfully negotiate a contract. What were some of the sticking points in those negotiations?

(SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORNS HONKING)

DEL BARCO: Well, the studios' alliance - the AMPTP - said that they offered the writers higher base pay and residuals, but they said the sticking points were the union's demands for mandatory staffing and duration of employment. You know, the economy has been uncertain, and keep in mind that some studios, even here at Netflix, have been laying off employees. The WGA's proposal called for the so-called mini rooms to be staffed by at least six writers - four of them as writer/producer so that they'll get paid more - and they also want a guaranteed minimum of 10 weeks of work for those mini rooms.

PFEIFFER: How could this strike compare to the last one from 15 or 16 years ago?

DEL BARCO: Well, you know, yes, we've seen this movie before, but it was a different time then. In 2007, Hollywood was shut down for more than three months, and it cost billions of dollars to the economy. And even before that, in 1988, the writers went on strike for five months. As you mentioned, the late-night shows are off tonight. ""Saturday Night Live"" is next, and then maybe soap operas and so on and so on - depends on how long the strike goes.

PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Mandalit del Barco. Thank you.

DEL BARCO: Thank you.

Apr 28 2023,Biden officials sue Tennessee over trans healthcare ban,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/04/28/bill-lee-tennessee-department-of-justice-joe-biden-lawsuit,"The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging Tennessee lawmakers on their ban on gender-affirming care for minors.

Biden administrators submitted court filings on Wednesday (26 April) arguing that legislation SB1 is unconstitutional due to its ban on gender-affirming care for under-18s.

The bill, signed by governor Bill Lee on 2 March, would prohibit doctors at risk of lawsuits from parents, guardians, or the state attorney general.

If passed, the bill’s ban would go into effect on 1 July 2023 and would deny all under-18s in the state the right to trans healthcare.

Following the lawsuit’s filing, Tennessee attorney Henry Leventis said the bill “violates the constitutional rights of some of Tennessee’s most vulnerable citizens.”

“Left unchallenged, it would prohibit transgender children from receiving health care that their medical providers and their parents have determined to be medically necessary,” he said.

Additionally, assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said medical autonomy is “a right that everyone should have.”

She added that this right extends to “transgender children, who are especially vulnerable to serious risks of depression, anxiety, and suicide.”

Like other countries, trans healthcare for under-18s in the US extends only to physically reversible puberty blockers.

Under-18s are not permitted, by law, to undergo gender-affirming surgeries such as facial feminisation surgery or gender-reassignment surgery.

Despite this, the bill’s supporters have still attempted to frame it as an effort to protect children.

Governor Bill Lee has taken aim at multiple rights of transgender people over the past year with bills banning participation in elite competitions, as well as bans on drag performances.

The Tennessee governor found himself in hot water, however, after pictures of him cross-dressing during a high-school party, were leaked in March.

The photo, believed to be taken in 1977, sees Lee wearing a wig and a cheerleader’s outfit with the title “Hard Knock Woman.”

He was accused of hypocrisy after the pictures were unearthed amid his campaign of support for Senate Bill 3, which bans public drag performances.

The bill, which has since been enacted, bans “adult cabaret performances” in locations that could be “viewed by a person who is not an adult.”

When confronted about the pictures while talking to the press, Lee said the comparison was “ridiculous.”

“Conflating something like that to sexualised entertainment in front of children, which is a very serious subject.”"
Jun 07 2023,Judge blocks Florida ban on life-saving healthcare for trans kids,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/06/07/florida-ron-desantis-gender-affirming-care-ban,"Florida legislation banning gender-affirming healthcare for trans people under the age of 18 is one step closer to being thrown out, after a judge ruled against it.

On Tuesday (6 June), district court judge Robert Hinkle temporarily blocked Senate Bill 254 after finding that arguments in favour of the legislation were built on the grounds of “dog-whistles” and bigotry.

His decision condemned the state’s arguments for the bill and he particularly criticised the “unspoken suggestion” that transgender people are faking their identities.

“The elephant in the room should be noted at the outset,” the judge wrote. “Gender identity is real, the record makes this clear. The medical defendants, speaking through their attorneys, have admitted it.”

If allowed to go ahead, not only would SB 254 prohibit healthcare providers from prescribing potentially life-saving gender-affirming care to transgender under-18s, but it would also allow state officials to temporarily seize custody of a child from their parents if gender-affirming care is suspected to have been administered.

Additionally, it would require trans adults seeking gender-affirming care to sign a consent form and prevent treatments from being covered by government healthcare insurer Medicaid.

The law also prevents healthcare professionals from performing gender-affirming surgeries on trans youth, despite there being no institution that provides those surgeries to people under the age of 15.

Proponents of the bill hadn’t adequately justified the need for the legislation without resorting to dog-whistles, and they need to “put up or shut up”, Hinkle said.

“Do you acknowledge that there are individuals with actual gender identities opposite their natal sex, or do you not? Dog-whistles ought not to be tolerated,” he added.

He noted that gender-affirming care has also been accepted by every major medical organisation across the US and slapped down claims that Florida would join an “international consensus” against gender-affirming care.

“This assertion is false. No matter how many times the defendants say it, it will still be false,” the judge made clear. “No country in Europe entirely bans these treatments.”

Emergency lawsuit filed challenging SB 254

A group of Florida families with trans children filed a lawsuit in March to challenge SB 254 after lawmakers introduced the legislation to the House floor.

One of them, who remained anonymous, said the judge’s ruling allowed their family to “[breathe] a huge sigh of relief”.

She added: “My husband and I have been heart-broken and worried sick about not being able to care for our daughter in the way we know she needs. I’m sure most any parent can imagine the sense of powerlessness that comes from being unable to do something as basic as get medical care for your child.”

The Southern Legal Counsel, LGBTQ+ Legal Advocates & Defenders, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign are representing the families.

In a joint statement, the organisations called the ruling a “powerful affirmation” of the humanity of trans people across the world.

“The court recognised the profound harm the state of Florida is causing by forcing parents to watch their kids suffer rather than provide them with safe and effective care that will allow them to thrive,” they added.

“We are incredibly relieved that these Florida parents can continue to get healthcare for their children while we proceed to challenge these bans and eventually see them fully overturned.”"
Oct 04 2023,"75,000 Kaiser Permanente employees walk off job in largest healthcare worker strike in U.S. history",New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/2023/10/04/kaiser-permanente-strike-nurses-pharmacists,"More than 75,000 unionized Kaiser Permanente employees walked off the job in several states early Wednesday morning, spurring the largest healthcare worker strike in U.S. history.

The Oakland, California-headquartered company is one of the nation’s largest not-for-profit healthcare networks, providing service to approximately 13 million people in eight states and the District of Columbia.

The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, which represents more than 85,000 of the organization’s frontline staff and care providers, had previously agreed on a three-day strike beginning at 6 a.m., PT, Wednesday after the company failed to reach a settlement with employees.

“Kaiser executives continue to bargain in bad faith over solutions to the Kaiser short-staffing crisis, and the safety of workers and patients is on the line,” SEIU-UHW, the largest union in the coalition, said in a statement on social media late last month.

Early on Tuesday, the company said both sides remain at the bargaining table after “working through the night in an effort to reach an agreement.”

“There has been a lot of progress, with agreements reached on several specific proposals late Tuesday,” company spokesperson Wayne Davis told the Daily News.

On Sept. 22, the coalition officially informed Kaiser Permanente executives the unions’ three-day action would start Oct. 4 and would involve employees in California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, Virginia, and Washington D.C.

In a letter sent to Kaiser Permanente CEO Greg Adams and other executives earlier this year, the coalition demanded changes “to solve the staffing crisis and provide safe patient care.”

“After three years of the COVID-19 pandemic, there simply aren’t enough healthcare workers to safely and properly care for patients,” the letter read in part. “Even before the pandemic, we faced a healthcare worker shortage; now, it is becoming a full-blown crisis that threatens all aspects of patient care.”

The coalition is asking for a $25 hourly minimum age, as well as “a fair and equitable across-the-board pay increase for every member of our coalition,” including a 6.5% raise in the first two years of the labor contract followed by a 5.75% raise in the next two years.

The unions called Kaiser’s proposal — which included annual raises of 3% to 4%, depending on the location, for the first two years, then 2% or 3% for the following two years — “offensive.”

Striking employees include nurses, X-ray technicians, ultrasound sonographers, pharmacists, emergency department technicians, and others.

Thousands of temporary employees have been called to work during the strike. While some non-emergency services might have to be rescheduled during this time, emergency departments will remain open, the company said.

Jun 02 2023,"Louisiana closing in on gender affirming healthcare ban for transgender children, teens",Houma Today,not-yet-rated,https://houmatoday.com/story/news/2023/06/02/louisiana-close-to-gender-affirming-healthcare-ban-for-transgender-kids-during-lgbt-pride-month/70281685007,"Louisiana's state Senate revived a bill to ban gender affirming healthcare for transgender minors and a committee on Friday advanced it toward what will almost be certain final passage in the Legislature.

In a rare, but not unprecedented move, Senators voted 26-12 Thursday to bring House Bill 648 by Republican Pollock Rep. Gabe Firment back for consideration after the Senate Health and Welfare Committee voted 5-4 last week to kill the measure with the tie-breaking vote from Acadiana Republican Sen. Fred Mills.

Mills faced fierce social media backlash from national conservatives that prompted extra security in the Senate chamber, and Thursday night Republican West Monroe Sen. Stewart Cathey made a motion to bring the bill back to life and send it to the Judiciary A Committee, which advanced it without opposition Friday afternoon.

Friday's action reverses a rare win for the LGBTQ community in the Louisiana Legislature, where a version of what critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" in classrooms bill and a bill to restrict children's access to public library materials deemed ""sexually explicit"" are steamrolling toward final passage.

There was no debate on Firment's bill Friday and it was advanced to the full Senate without objections after the three Democrats on the panel boycotted the hearing, Democratic Alexandria Sen. Jay Luneau confirmed to USA Today Network.

Chairman Barrow Peacock, a Shreveport Republican, said the Judiciary A hearing was designed to focus on ""legal remedies"" for those potentially harmed by gender affirming healthcare rather than rehash the long debate and testimony from the Senate Health and Welfare hearing.

Gender affirming healthcare can range from counseling to puberty blockers to hormones to surgery.

Firment insists such healthcare is experimental and dangerous, a position some doctors supported during the Senate Health and Welfare hearing on his bill.

But the American Medical Association disagrees.

“The AMA opposes the dangerous intrusion of government into the practice of medicine and the criminalization of healthcare decision-making,” said AMA board members Dr. Michael Suk in 2021. “Gender-affirming care is medically-necessary, evidence-based care that improves the physical and mental health of transgender and gender-diverse people.”

Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards has said he opposes much of the anti-LGBTQ legislation, but it's unclear whether he will veto Firment's bill or allow it to become law without his signature as he did last year with a bill that banned transgender athletes from competing on girls' or women's sports teams.

The House has already passed Firment's bill with a veto-proof margin.

Jun 21 2023,Federal judge strikes down Arkansas' gender-affirming healthcare ban as unconstitutional,Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette,center,https://nwaonline.com/news/2023/jun/21/judge-blocks-arkansas-ban-on-gender-affirming-care,"A federal judge in Little Rock struck down Arkansas’ first-in-the-nation ban on gender affirming healthcare treatments for minors as unconstitutional on Tuesday, saying the law violates the Constitutional rights of transgender youth, their parents, and their medical providers.

In his ruling, U.S. District Judge James M. Moody held that the plaintiffs — four transgender youths, their families and their doctors — had prevailed on all their claims and ruled the ban violates the Equal Protection Clause, the Due Process Clauses, and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Two years ago in July, in a rare ruling from the bench, Moody granted a temporary injunction to block the law from going into effect until the case was resolved. That ruling came two weeks before the law was set to go into effect.

A ruling last year by a three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Moody’s temporary injunction and an appeal by the state for an en banc hearing — meaning before the full 8th Circuit — was rejected.

Tuesday’s ruling makes the injunction permanent.

The law, Act 626 of 2021, had it gone into effect, would have prohibited doctors from providing or referring transgender young people for medically necessary health care related to the medically recognized condition known as “gender dysphoria.” Gender dysphoria is defined by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., as the feeling of discomfort or distress that might occur in people whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physical characteristics.

The legislation would have prohibited the use of hormones and puberty-blocking drugs for young people and gender-affirming surgical procedures, as well as insurance coverage for gender-affirmation treatment for the young and remove any requirement that insurance carriers provide any coverage for gender-affirmation procedures in general. It was passed in 2021 by GOP super-majorities in both the House and Senate, which overrode a veto by Gov. Asa Hutchinson to pass the legislation.

Plaintiffs in the case, represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, are Dylan Brandt, Parker Saxton, Sabrina Jennen and Brooke Dennis and their parents, Joanna Brandt, Donnie Saxton, Aaron and Lacey Jennen, Shayne and Amanda Dennis, and two physicians who provide health care for transgender teens, Dr. Michele Hutchison and Dr. Kathryn Stambough.

Defendants in the case, represented by a legal team from the state’s attorney general’s office, are Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin, Medical Board Director Amy Embry and Medical Board members Sylvia Simon, Robert Brevingcq Jr., John Scribner, Elizabeth Anderson, Rhys Branman, Edward “Ward” Gardner, Rodney Griffin, Betty Guhman, Bryan Hyatt, Timothy Paden, Don Philips, William Rutledge, David Staggs and Veryl Hodges.

Moody’s decision comes more than six months after the conclusion of a two-week bench trial held last year in two parts, concluding in early December, during which healthcare providers testifying for the plaintiffs outlined the benefits of such care. Supporting the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, based on filings with the court, were the U.S. Department of Justice as well as a number of professional medical organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Endocrine Society, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, among others.

Moody said in his ruling that experts for the plaintiffs had outlined numerous studies undertaken in the U.S. and around the world and said evidence presented at trial “showed that the prohibited medical care improves the health and well-being of many adolescents with gender dysphoria.”

He said that testimony was bolstered by the testimony of the parent plaintiffs, who testified to the positive transformation their children had experienced once they began treatment for gender dysphoria.

“This care allowed them to grow from depressed, anxious, and withdrawn young people into happy and healthy teenagers who looked forward to their futures,” Moody wrote, adding that, “the State offered no evidence to refute the decades of clinical experience demonstrating the efficacy of gender-affirming medical care.”

Moody said the state’s case hinged on a claim that banning gender-affirming care would protect children from experimental medical treatments and that the state claimed there is a lack of evidence to support the efficacy of such care, that the banned treatment has serious risks and side effects, that many patients will desist in their gender incongruence, that some patients will later regret receiving the treatments and that such treatments are provided without appropriate evaluation and informed consent.

“The evidence presented at trial does not support these assertions,” he wrote, saying that the risks outlined of hormone therapy are the same for transgender and cisgender people alike and are discussed with parents and patients to allow transgender patients and their families to make informed decisions.

In a press release Tuesday, Griffin attacked Moody’s ruling, claiming that no scientific evidence exists to prove that young people will benefit from such care and he vowed to appeal the ruling to the 8th Circuit.

“I am disappointed in the decision that prevents our state from protecting our children against dangerous medical experimentation under the moniker of ‘gender transition.’” Griffin said in a statement from his office. “Unfortunately, Judge Moody misses what is widely understood across the United States and in the United Kingdom and European countries: There is no scientific evidence that any child will benefit from these procedures, while the consequences are harmful and often permanent. I will continue fighting as long as it takes to stop providers from sterilizing children.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders also attacked the ruling via Twitter, saying transgender care “is not ‘care,’” but instead claiming that it is the result of a political agenda “at the expense of our kids and subjecting them to permanent and harmful procedures.”

“Only in the far-Left’s woke vision of America is it not appropriate to protect children,” Sanders said in the tweet.

The Democratic Party of Arkansas hailed the ruling in a tweet Tuesday, calling the decision “A Huge Victory for Trans Rights in Arkansas.”

The Campaign for Southern Equality, an LGBTQ advocacy organization based in North Carolina, tweeted “GREAT news in Arkansas,” in a tweet announcing the ruling.

The Democracy Forward Foundation, a non-profit and non-partisan legal services and public policy research organization based in” Washington D.C., called the decision “another Pride Month victory in the courts for LGBTQ+ children, families, and evidence-based medicine.

A press release issued Tuesday by the ACLU of Arkansas said the decision marks, “the first final merits ruling in the country on such a law.” The ACLU said in the release that similar laws in Alabama, Florida, and Indiana are blocked by preliminary injunctions from federal courts and that so far in 2023, the ACLU and its nationwide affiliate network have challenged seven new laws similar to Arkansas’ ban.

Dylan Brandt, the plaintiff for whom the lawsuit is named, expressed his gratitude for the ruling in the ACLU release.

“I’m so grateful the judge heard my experience of how this health care has changed my life for the better and saw the dangerous impact this law could have on my life and that of countless other transgender people,” Brandt said in the release. “My mom and I wanted to fight this law not just to protect my health care, but also to ensure that transgender people like me can safely and fully live our truths. Transgender kids across the country are having their own futures threatened by laws like this one, and it’s up to all of us to speak out, fight back, and give them hope.”

Reached by phone Tuesday, Donnie Saxton, the father of 18-year-old Parker Saxton, could barely contain his excitement over the news.

“I’m doing great, I couldn’t be better,” Saxton said. “Everything is perfect, it couldn’t be better right now.”

Saxton said that Parker, who had just made his first solo trip to the Arkansas Children’s Hospital Gender Spectrum Clinic Tuesday morning, had returned home and was asleep when the ruling was announced.

“I tried to call Parker as soon as we got word of the ruling,” Saxton said. “I’m assuming that he has come home and crashed out. He’s going to be overjoyed here in a few minutes when I go in and tell him.”

Saxton said the ruling will relieve a lot of pressure that has been on the family and on Parker.

“He knows now that right is right, that there’s nothing wrong with him and that he can be human,” he said. “He can be the person he needs to be to survive and thrive.”

Holly Dickson, executive director of ACLU of Arkansas, said other legislation, such as a law passed in the recently concluded session allowing patients who have received gender-affirming care as minors to sue their doctors for medical malpractice up to 15 years after they turn 18, could still have a chilling effect on such care but she said she expects the effect to be negligible.

“The physicians who provide gender-affirming care to trans Arkansans aren’t easily bullied or swayed by politics or bad laws,” she said."

Jul 17 2023,"Decade after Detroit's bankruptcy, city employees grapple with retirement insecurity and healthcare concerns",Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/07/17/detroit-bankruptcy-city-employees-grapple-with-retirement-insecurity-healthcare-concerns,"Mike Berent has spent more than 27 years rushing into burning houses in Detroit, pulling people to safety and ensuring his fellow firefighters get out alive.

But as the 52-year-old Detroit Fire Department lieutenant approaches mandatory retirement at age 60, he says one thing is clear: He will need to keep working to make ends meet.

“I’m trying to put as much money away as a I can,” said Berent, who also works in sales. “A second job affords you to have a little bit of extra.”

Thousands of city employees and retirees lost big on July 18, 2013, when a state-appointed manager made Detroit the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy.

A decade later, the Motor City has risen from the ashes of insolvency, with balanced budgets, revenue increases and millions of dollars socked away. But Berent and others who spent years on Detroit’s payroll say they can’t help but feel left behind.

“You become a firefighter because that’s your passion and you’ll make a decent living. You would retire with a good pension,” said Berent, who told The Associated Press that his monthly pension payments will be more than $1,000 lower than expected due to the bankruptcy.

Berent’s city-funded healthcare also ends with retirement, five years before he’s eligible for Medicare.

“I don’t see us ever getting healthcare back,” he said. “It’s going to have to come out of our pensions.”

The architect of the bankruptcy filing was Kevyn Orr, a lawyer hired by then-Gov. Rick Snyder in 2013 to fix Detroit’s budget deficit and its underfunded pensions, healthcare costs and bond payments.

Detroit exited bankruptcy in December 2014 with about $7 billion in debt restructured or wiped out and $1.7 billion set aside to improve city services. Businesses, foundations and the state donated more than $800 million to soften the pension cuts and preclude the sale of city-owned art.

The pension cuts were necessary, Orr insisted.

“I’ve read about the pain, the very real pain,” he told the AP. “But the alternatives of what was going to happen — just on the math — would have been significantly worse.”

In 2013, Detroit had some 21,000 retired workers who were owed benefits, with underfunded obligations of about $3.5 billion for pensions and $5.7 billion for retiree health coverage.

In the months before the bankruptcy, state-backed bond money helped the city meet payroll for its 10,000 employees.

“Those problems were well on their way years or decades before we got there,” Orr said.

Daniel Varner, the president and chief executive of Goodwill Industries of Greater Detroit, which provides on-the-job training and skilled labor to businesses, called the bankruptcy filing “heartbreaking.”

“In some ways, it represented the failure of all of us who had been working so hard to achieve the (city’s) renaissance,” Varner said. “On the flip side … maybe this is the fresh start? I think we’ve been making great progress.”

The city, which was subject to state oversight and a state-monitored spending plan for years after the bankruptcy filing, has reported nine consecutive years of balanced budgets and strong cash surpluses.

Mike Duggan was elected mayor and took office in 2014. Hoping to slow the exodus of people and businesses from Detroit — its population plummeted from about 1.8 million in 1950 to below 700,000 in 2013 — and increase the tax base, Duggan’s administration began pushing improvements to city services and quality of life.

More than 24,000 abandoned houses and other vacant structures were demolished, mostly using federal funds. Thousands more were renovated and put on the market to attract or keep families in Detroit.

“Very little of our recovery had anything to do with the bankruptcy,” Duggan said Tuesday, pointing to business developments and neighborhood improvement projects. “The economic development strategy is what’s driving it.”

Jay Aho and his wife, Tanya, have seen improvements in their eastside neighborhood. Along nearby Sylvester Street, about half a dozen vacant homes have been torn down and just one ramshackle house remains, with peeling siding, sagging roof and surrounded by waist-high weeds, trees and a thriving rose bush. Rabbits, deer and pheasants have started to appear in the grass and weed-filled vacant lots.

“We benefit from having lots of open space, beautiful surroundings,” said Jay Aho, 49.

Born in southwest Detroit, 32-year-old Arielle Kyer also sees improvements.

“There were no parks like what there are now,” she said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new splash pad attended by Duggan. “Everything is different.”

Downtown, boutique hotels and upscale restaurants have sprung up, and a 685-foot (208-meter) skyscraper under construction is expected to host a hotel, a restaurant, shops, offices and residential units.

Corktown, a neighborhood just east of downtown, got a boost in 2018 when Ford Motor Co. bought and began renovating the hulking Michigan Central train station, which for years was a symbol of the city’s blight. The building will be part of a campus focusing on autonomous vehicles.

Ford’s move has attracted other investment, according to Aaron Black, the general manager of the nearby $75 million Godfrey Hotel, which is scheduled to open this year and whose owners also are developing homes in the neighborhood.

“The (city’s) brand may have been dented, ”Black said. “The brand may have been tarnished, but Detroit is head and shoulders above a lot of other competitive cities.”

Some warn against too much optimism.

Detroit’s two pension systems have been making monthly payments to retirees without any contributions from the city for the past decade. That is set to change next year when the city will be required to resume contributions from a city-created fund that now stands at about $470 million.

Detroit’s Chief Financial Officer Jay Rising says both pension systems are better funded than a decade ago. But Leonard Gilroy, senior managing director of the Washington-based Reason Foundation’s Pension Integrity Project, says his data shows the systems’ funding levels near where they were in 2013.

“It’s a big moment for the city that presents daunting future fiscal challenges to avoid further deterioration of the pensions,” Gilroy said. “They are getting the keys back to fund their pension system, which would be a huge responsibility if these plans were fully funded, and is that much more of a challenge given their fragile, underfunded state.”"
Apr 27 2023,Missouri’s near-total ban on trans healthcare temporarily blocked by judge,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/04/27/missouri-andrew-bailey,"A Missouri judge has ruled to temporarily suspend restrictions on gender-affirming care for trans people, after an emergency ruling made by an attorney general looked set to all-but ban it from the state.

21st Judicial Circuit judge Ellen Ribaudo issued the ruling on Thursday (27 April) to restrict attorney general Andrew Bailey’s earlier, emergency ruling on gender-affirming care, which would make accessing healthcare nearly impossible.

Various legal teams, including Lambda Legal and the ACLU, filed a petition to blockade the emergency order made by Bailey on 13 April which stipulates that those seeking care must go through three years of “long-lasting, persisent and intense” gender dysphoria.

It also requires 15 hours of therapy over 18 months before a diagnosis could be given.

Bailey’s ruling targets both trans adults and trans youth, and stipulates that symptoms of depression and anxiety must be “treated and resolved” before care can be administered.

The restraining order now means that members of the court have until Monday (1 May) to consider each side’s argument before coming to a ruling.

“We are grateful for the court’s decision to issue a temporary stay,” a statement from ACLU Missouri read.

“No less than the health and well-being of thousands of transgender Missourians is at stake.

“Gender-affirming care is supported by overwhelming scientific data, decades of clinical experience, and the medical consensus of major medical organisations in the United States.

“The decision on whether or not to allow the implementation of this rule, which ignores the proven sciences and experience of health care providers, will have an immediate impact on Missourians of all ages and their access to livesaving medical care.”

Temporary relief ‘welcomed’

Activists across the state had already begun receiving letters from medical professionals detailing their rescinding of care in anticipation of the ruling.

Various letters and notices from doctors urging patients using gender-affirming care to request a “90-day supply of your medications” were shared across social media.

One, shared by trans Missouri resident Devyn, saw their doctor write: “I do not currently haver the processes in place to defend my license to practice gender-affirming care.

“If this rule is overturned, I will reinstate your plan of care immediately.”

Legal teams involved in the restraining order petition, which was filed on behalf of Southampton Community Healthcare and the families of two younger transgender children, have said they “look forward” to the final ruling on the matter.

“While we welcome this temporary relief, we look forward to the judge ultimately preventing this rule from going into effect.”"
Apr 26 2023,US Justice Dept sues Tennessee over transgender healthcare law,Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/27/us-justice-dept-sues-tennessee-over-transgender-healthcare-law,"The United States Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit challenging Tennessee’s new law banning transgender youth from receiving gender-affirming care, one of the several laws the state’s Republican-dominated legislature enacted this year aimed at LGBTQ+ people.

The federal government is seeking to invalidate the statute because “no person should be denied access to necessary medical care just because of their transgender status”, Assistant US Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.

The Justice Department said the law violates the US Constitution’s equal protection clause by discriminating on the basis of both sex and transgender status.

“The right to consider your health and medically approved treatment options with your family and doctors is a right that everyone should have, including transgender children, who are especially vulnerable to serious risks of depression, anxiety and suicide,” Clarke added.

The federal lawsuit comes after Clarke sent a letter to all state attorneys general last month warning them that federal law protects transgender youth against discrimination. The Justice Department also intervened last year in a lawsuit challenging a similar ban on transgender medical care for young people. That lawsuit is ongoing.

Republican Governor Bill Lee signed off on prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors earlier this year.

The bill was the first proposal filed in this year’s legislative session. Republican leaders did so in response to video surfacing on social media last year of a Nashville doctor touting that gender-affirming procedures are “huge money makers” for hospitals.

That hospital has since paused its transgender services for young people.

Republican lawmakers also advanced legislation designed to severely limit where drag shows can take place, making Tennessee the first state to do so. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the statute from being implemented.

Nationally, Republican legislators have proposed hundreds of laws aimed at transgender people, with at least 14 states restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors.

Under Tennessee’s law – set to take effect on July 1 – doctors will be prohibited from prescribing puberty blockers or hormones, or providing other gender-affirming care to anyone under 18. The law spells out a handful of exceptions, including allowing doctors to perform such medical services if the patient’s care begins before the law goes into effect. In those cases, care must end by March 31, 2024.

Healthcare providers who violate the ban would be subject to regulatory discipline and could be sued by the state attorney general or private parties. Violations carry a $25,000 penalty.

A spokesperson for the Tennessee Attorney General’s office did not immediately respond to requests from the Associated Press for comment.

The Justice Department’s lawsuit is the second complaint challenging the new Tennessee law. Last week, three transgender children and their parents sued the state, claiming the law violates the equal protection clause in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution because it excludes treatment for gender dysphoria while allowing the same treatments to be used for other conditions."
Jun 06 2023,Federal judge issues firey ruling against Florida’s trans healthcare ban,LGBTQ Nation,left,https://lgbtqnation.com/2023/06/federal-judge-issues-firey-ruling-against-floridas-trans-healthcare-ban,"A federal judge has struck down parts of Florida’s laws and policies banning gender-affirming care, saying that the bans contradict “widely accepted standards” of medical care. While the judge’s decision only affects three of the seven families of trans youth who sued state officials over the ban, legal observers say the judge’s ruling could help restore healthcare for countless trans Floridians of all ages.

In his 44-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Hinkle (appointed in 1996 by President Bill Clinton) affirmed the existence of transgender identities. He also said that the defendants’ families may pursue puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and their doctors may provide it without fear of criminal or civil penalties.

Hinkle’s ruling noted that an estimated 1% of the population identifies as trans and that Florida officials only presented one defense expert (Dr. Stephen Levine) who has actually treated a significant number of transgender patients. Hinkle added that the state’s experts all seemed to hold the “unspoken suggestion… that transgender identity is not real, that it is made up.”

The judge noted that among the state’s experts, Dr. Paul Hruz called trans identity a “charade” or “delusion,” and Dr. Patrick Lappert called gender-affirming care a “lie,” a “moral violation,” a “huge evil,” and “diabolical.” Hinkle wrote that he considered Cruz “a deeply biased advocate, not as an expert.”

Hinkle noted that other state employees and consultants have called gender-affirming healthcare a “woke idea” or a profiteering scheme by the pharmaceutical industry or doctors.

The judge wrote that “any proponent of the challenged statute and rules should put up or shut up” by stating clearly whether they acknowledge the existence of individuals whose gender identities differ from the sexes they were assigned at birth. “Dog whistles ought not be tolerated,” he added.

Florida’s false concern about “dangerous” hormone treatments

Hinkle noted that puberty blockers and HRT are standard treatments for gender dysphoria “widely followed by well-trained clinicians” and endorsed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, as well as numerous major U.S. healthcare organizations. He also noted that “no country in Europe or… anywhere in the world entirely bans these treatments,” except for in oppressive anti-LGBTQ+ regimes.

“At least as shown by this record, not a single reputable medical association has taken a contrary position [to offering these treatments],” Judge Hinkle noted. “These medications … have been used for decades to treat other conditions [like endometriosis, prostate cancer, and early onset puberty]. Their safety records and overall effects are well known. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved their use, though not specifically to treat gender dysphoria.”

Even though the FDA hasn’t approved these drugs for treating gender dysphoria, that “says precisely nothing about whether the drugs are safe and effective when used for that purpose,” Hinkle wrote. “Off-label use of drugs is commonplace and widely accepted across the medical profession,” he added, noting that their non-FDA approved use for gender dysphoria isn’t itself reason enough to claim that such medications are dangerous or should be banned.

The judge acknowledged that the medications’ possible effects present “legitimate concerns about fertility and sexuality that a child entering puberty is not well-equipped to evaluate and for which parents may be less-than-perfect decision-makers.”

But despite any risks these treatments present, they are still “effective” and “appropriate” treatments whose benefits outweigh any risks, he wrote. Even Dr. Levine said that he would regulate the treatments, making sure patients knew of possible risks, rather than banning them outright, Hinkle noted. The consequence of denying these treatments would be deadly, he added.

“Denial of this treatment will cause needless suffering for a substantial number of patients and will increase anxiety, depression, and the risk of suicide,” Hinkle wrote. “There is no rational basis for a state to categorically ban these treatments.”

“The record includes no evidence that these treatments have caused substantial adverse clinical results in properly screened and treated patients,” he continued. “Regret is rare; indeed, the defendants have offered no evidence of any Florida resident who regrets being treated with [puberty blockers] or cross-sex hormones.”

Florida’s ban interferes with “parents’ rights”

“I find that the plaintiffs’ ability to evaluate the benefits and risks of treating their individual children this way far exceeds the ability of the State of Florida to do so,” Hinkle’s decision states. “I find that the plaintiffs’ motivation is love for their children and the desire to achieve the best possible treatment for them. This is not the State’s motivation.”

Hinkle’s decision noted that the Eighth Circuit court placed a preliminary injunction on Arkansas’ own trans healthcare ban. Like that court, Hinkle agreed that banning hormone therapy for trans people is a form of sex-based discrimination that shows bias against gender-nonconforming individuals.

He held that the reason behind Florida’s ban was to dissuade people from identifying as any gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. As proof, he noted that Florida’s Department of Health also opposed non-medical “social transitioning” which allows a child to explore their gender identity presentation at home and in public.

“Nothing could have motivated this remarkable intrusion into parental prerogatives other than opposition to transgender status itself,” Hinkle wrote.

Jane Doe, one of the parents named in the suit, hailed Hinkle’s ruling, saying, “My husband and I have been heartbroken and worried sick about not being able to care for our daughter in the way we know she needs. I’m sure most any parent can imagine the sense of powerlessness that comes from being unable to do something as basic as get medical care for your child.”

“Today my entire family is breathing a huge sigh of relief knowing we can now access the treatment that we know will keep Susan healthy and allow her to continue being the happy, confident child she has been,” Doe said of her child.

Florida’s laws and policies have resulted in transgender adults losing access to gender-affirming care as well. Trans journalist Erin Reed wrote that, after speaking to a few legal experts, medical organizations may be analyzing the case before they start offering such care to adults without fear of penalty. However, to do so safely may first require a separate court case that specifically covers adults.

The families in the case are represented by Southern Legal Counsel, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign."
Jul 11 2023,Sixth Circuit court allows Tennessee’s ban on trans youth healthcare to take effect,Out In Jersey,left,https://outinjersey.net/sixth-circuit-court-allows-tennessees-ban-on-trans-youth-healthcare-to-take-effect,"For the first time, Federal Court allows for gender-affirming care ban to take effect

A panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has accepted a request by Tennessee’s attorney general to lift an injunction issued by a lower court blocking enforcement of the state’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The law, originally set to take effect on July 1, will now take effect immediately.

In June 2023, a federal district court granted a request for a preliminary injunction against Public Chapter No. 1, in a lawsuit brought by Samantha and Brian Williams of Nashville and their 15-year-old daughter, as well as two other anonymous families and Dr. Susan N. Lacy. The law prohibits medical providers from providing gender-affirming health care to transgender youth and requires trans youth currently receiving gender-affirming care to end that care within nine months of the law’s effective date of July 1, 2023 — by March 31, 2024.

“This ruling is beyond disappointing and a heartbreaking development for thousands of transgender youth, their doctors, and their families,” The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Tennessee, Lambda Legal and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP said in a joint statement. “As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Tennessee to know this fight is far from over and we will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Tennessee is made a safer place to raise every family.”

This is the first federal court to allow a ban on gender-affirming care to take effect after courts have unanimously blocked similar bans in Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Indiana and Kentucky. In June 2023, a federal court in Arkansas struck down that state’s ban on gender-affirming care in the first ruling on the merits of such a law, finding it violated the Equal Protection Clause, Due Process Clauses, and First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

“This irresponsible ruling from the Sixth Circuit is a ruling layered with assumptions about transgender lives and gender-affirming care,” Phil Cobucci, founder of Inclusion Tennessee said. “We continue to affirm that this law is unconstitutional and will ultimately be overturned — and Tennessee families deserve a more through examination of this outrageous policy.”

He continued, “SB 1 does not protect children, it only hurts our most vulnerable community members, causing only harm and pain. In the ruling itself, the judges emphasized that the findings were not final and that they were made under rushed circumstances, utilizing perceived facts from debates in states that have been hellbent on eradicating transgender people from our communities. Families and parents should have the ultimate decision of how to aid and support their children, with the support of their physicians and medical practitioners — not the government. All transgender people, no matter their age, should be able access the healthcare they deserve.”

This decision made on July 8 is a preliminary one. The panel of judges indicated that a full ruling on the injunction would come before September 30.

“This is state-sanctioned cruelty against Tennessee families, who are only seeking health care for their kids as best they can,” Molly Rose Quinn, Executive Director of OUTMemphis said.

“They’ve faced unrelenting confusion and heartbreak this year because they’re afraid the state will take away their ability to live free and happy lives in the Volunteer State.”

She continued, “We are doubling down on navigation services and support for trans youth and their families. Don’t give up. OUTMemphis is behind you in this fight, and we won’t stop until Tennessee is a safe and affirming state.”"

Apr 20 2023,North Dakota governor signs law limiting healthcare for transgender patients,Los Angeles Times,left,https://latimes.com/world-nation/story/2023-04-20/north-dakota-governor-signs-law-limiting-trans-health-care,"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a bill into law that restricts transgender healthcare and makes providing gender-affirming care to people under 18 a crime.

North Dakota’s Republican Gov. Doug Burgum has signed a bill into law that restricts transgender healthcare in the state, immediately making it a crime to give gender-affirming care to people younger than 18.

Gender-affirming care for minors has been available in the U.S. for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations, but it has increasingly come under attack in many conservative legislatures, including North Dakota’s, where lawmakers have passed at least three anti-trans bills this year.

The measure that Burgum signed Wednesday received veto-proof support from GOP lawmakers — though some Republicans did vote against it, alongside all Democrats.

In a statement released Thursday morning, Burgum said the law is “aimed at protecting children from the life-altering ramifications of gender reassignment surgeries,” adding that medical professionals have testified that these surgeries have not been and are not being performed on minors in North Dakota.

He said the law still allows medication treatment, with parental consent, for early onset puberty and other rare circumstances, and minors currently receiving gender-affirming care will still be able to receive treatment.

“Going forward, thoughtful debate around these complex medical policies should demonstrate compassion and understanding for all North Dakota youth and their families,” he said.

The new law takes immediate effect and authorizes prosecutors to charge a healthcare provider with a felony — punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $20,000 in fines — for performing sex reassignment surgery on a minor.

It also empowers prosecutors to charge a provider with a misdemeanor — punishable by up to 360 days in prison and $3,000 in fines — for giving gender-affirming medication, like puberty blockers, to a trans child.

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota denounced the new law as “a vast government overreach that undermines the fundamental rights of parents” and violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection and due process by singling out gender-affirming care for prohibition.

“By signing this bill into law, Gov. Burgum has put the government in charge of making vital decisions traditionally reserved for parents in North Dakota,” Cody Schuler, the group’s advocacy manager, said in a statement. “This ban won’t stop North Dakotans from being trans, but it will deny them critical support that helps struggling transgender youth grow up to become thriving transgender adults.”

Earlier this month, Burgum also signed a transgender athlete ban into law after it passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. In 2021, Burgum vetoed a similar bill, but House and Senate lawmakers did not have enough votes back then to override his veto.

North Dakota joins at least 13 other states that have enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming care for minors.

Republican lawmakers across the country have advanced hundreds of measures aimed at nearly every facet of trans existence this year.

That includes bans on gender-affirming care for minors, restrictions on which restrooms transgender people can use, measures restricting classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity, and bills that would out transgender students who want teachers to address them by the pronouns they use.

The Food and Drug Administration approved puberty blockers 30 years ago to treat children with precocious puberty — a condition that causes sexual development to begin much earlier than usual. Sex hormones — synthetic forms of estrogen and testosterone — were approved decades ago to treat hormone disorders or as birth control pills.

The FDA has not approved the medications specifically to treat gender-questioning youth, but they have been used for many years for that purpose “off label,” a common and accepted practice for many medical conditions. Doctors who treat transgender patients say those decades of use are proof the treatments are not experimental.

Research has shown that transgender youths and adults can be prone to suicidal behavior when forced to live as the sex they were assigned at birth. And critics of legislation to restrict gender-affirming care for children say it’s an attempt by conservatives to motivate their voting base.

Proponents of the measure have raised concerns about children changing their minds. Yet the evidence suggests that detransitioning is not as common as opponents of transgender medical treatment for youth contend, though few studies exist and they have their weaknesses."
Jun 03 2023,Texas governor kicks off Pride Month by banning healthcare for trans kids,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/06/03/texas-trans-kids-healthcare-ban,"Texas governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill banning life-saving, gender-affirming healthcare for trans youth.

The Republican governor signed SB 14 into law Friday (2 June), which bars trans people aged under 18-years-old from accessing gender-affirming medical care like puberty blockers and hormone therapies. It comes into effect on 1 September.

The legislation also requires people already receiving gender-affirming care in Texas to “wean off” the treatments “over a period of time”, forcing trans youth to detransition.

This is set to become one of the largest gender-affirming healthcare bans in the US as Texas is the second-largest state in the nation and home to thousands of young trans people.

The ACLU of Texas denounced Abbott for banning “life-saving healthcare for trans youth” and promised to see the Republican governor in court.

“Abbott can’t stop trans youth from thriving in Texas — and we’ll take him to court to make sure of it,” the group tweeted.

Emmett Schelling, executive director of the Transgender Education Network of Texas, told the Texas Tribune that “cruelty has always been the point” of hateful anti-trans bills like this gender-affirming healthcare ban.

“It’s not shocking that this governor would sign SB14 right at the beginning of Pride [Month]; however this will not stop trans people from continuing to exist with authenticity – as we always have,” Schelling said.

Trans people, parents of trans kids, healthcare professionals and major medical groups have said gender-affirming healthcare is medically necessary and appropriate care for trans youth.

Studies overwhelmingly show that trans people who have access to gender-affirming treatment are significantly less likely to experience depression and anxiety and consider suicide than those who are barred from such treatments.

Further research found trans youth who had access to hormone therapy reported an increase in positive emotions, life satisfaction and self-confidence.

Additionally, guidelines by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health reported several studies show that there are “low rates of patient regret and high rates of patient satisfaction” with gender-affirming treatments and surgeries for trans people.

Yet, the right for trans youth to access gender-affirming healthcare has become a hot button issue in the US with 18 states, including Texas, restricting their access to such treatments.

When marking International Transgender Day of Visibility on 31 March, president Joe Biden said the “wave of discriminatory state laws” attacking trans people, particularly trans youth, is “un-American and must end”.

Texas has unfortunately led the charge in the rollback on trans rights after Abbott ordered state officials to investigate the parents of trans youth for “child abuse” in February 2022.

After months of intrusive investigations, a Texas state court granted relief for the families named in a lawsuit against Abbott’s order, and that relief was expanded to cover any family that belongs to PFLAG, an LGBTQ+ advocacy group with more than 600 members in Texas.

Amid such attacks, suicide prevention resources for LGBTQ+ youth were removed from the Texas department of health and human services website. The state launched an investigation into a Texas hospital’s gender-affirming care for trans youth.

In May, trans rights activists were “pinned down”, arrested and dragged out of the state Capitol for peacefully protesting against SB 14."
Nov 04 2019,Warren Releases Healthcare Plan,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/warren-releases-healthcare-plan,"From the Left

The left applauds Warren’s detailed projections despite noting that some of the estimates may be unrealistic.

“The administrative costs [and profits] of private insurers are more than 25% of what they pay out in benefits each year. By contrast, the administrative costs of Medicare are less than 3% of what is paid in benefits. The potential savings from getting administrative costs for the whole system down to that of Medicare is close to $3 trillion over the next decade… Warren also proposes large reductions in payments to health care providers. Patients in the US pay drug companies, medical equipment manufacturers, doctors and other providers on average roughly twice as much as in other wealthy countries…



“There are a lot of moving parts here, each of which involves practical as well as political problems… [For example] There are issues with the planned funding mechanisms. It makes more sense just to charge employers a set percentage of wages rather than base payments on historic insurance premiums. In addition, a wealth tax may prove problematic for a variety of reasons. However, we should realize this is an opening gambit, not a finished product. The final version of the Affordable Care Act was 2,300 pages when it went to a vote. It is unlikely that a Medicare for All bill will be any shorter. Warren's proposal is not the final word. But it is an excellent first draft that provides a basis for future debate.”

Dean Baker, CNN

“Don’t get me wrong: The funding is important. But the most important overarching question is what kind of health-care system we want. Once we’ve decided that, we can figure out the best way to pay for it… What we have right now is really the worst of all possible worlds: A system with horrific problems, costing more than any system in the world, and paid for in ways that are inequitable and unsustainable. Would [Warren’s] plan be better?… Whatever plan you find most compelling, we should never forget that what we have now is a practical, financial and moral catastrophe. If we decide to change it, we can.”

Paul Waldman, Washington Post

Critics note that “in avoiding some of the problems associated with a switch to single payer, [Warren’s] proposal would keep some of the downsides associated with our existing system of employer-provided insurance. A talking point you often hear in favor of Medicare for All is it would relieve employers of the burden of paying for health insurance; this, obviously, leaves that burden in place. The large, lump-sum, per-employee health-care charge would remain a barrier to new hiring.”

Josh Barro, New York Magazine



But “the biggest question is whether $20.5 trillion is actually a plausible estimate of how much her plan would cost… Estimates from the nonpartisan Rand Corporation, the conservative-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and the center-left Urban Institute have each placed the 10-year cost of a single-payer plan at $31 trillion to $34 trillion… Reimbursement-rate cuts as big as Warren is envisioning would be extremely politically difficult to pass through Congress—and could lead to hospital closures or service cutbacks if they do… The reality remains that most countries around the world have established and maintained quality universal-health-care systems that cost less than even Warren’s proposal… The problem, of course, is that Warren and other single-payer advocates are not writing on a clean page, but rather seeking to reconfigure an enormously complex structure that consumes one-sixth of the national economy and employs hundreds of thousands of people.”

Ronald Brownstein, The Atlantic



Others note that “[Warren] has provided more detail on Medicare financing than Sanders has. She has also provided more overall policy detail, including on the taxes she would raise, than Joe Biden or Pete Buttigieg. And her Medicare plan comes much, much closer to paying for itself than various Republican tax cuts. I wish the conservatives complaining about her plan applied the same rigor to their own ideas… The biggest weakness of Warren’s approach is that it tries to bulldoze through the sizable public anxiety about radical changes to the health care system. Warren would not let people opt into Medicare, a wildly popular idea. She would force them to join… she needs to come up with a reassuring transition plan soon.”

David Leonhardt, New York Times



“Warren’s cost estimate is probably transparent and realisticenough to deflect unpleasant questions from debate moderators and journalists, which, ultimately, is the main point of this exercise. Warren’s floating a low number for how much her plan will cost, but it’s not the lowest one out there. And the substantive reasons to doubt it might not play well on a debate stage. I mean, what’s Pete Buttigieg going to say? Elizabeth Warren wants to cut America’s insane prescription drug prices too deeply? That Democrats shouldn’t trust numbers produced by the guy who ran Medicare for Obama?… The question now is whether voters will think Warren’s pitch is just too good to be true.”

Nov 07 2022,Truveta's big data healthcare project is pretty cool,TechCrunch,center,https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/truvetas-big-data-healthcare-project-is-pretty-cool/,"A few weeks back, TechCrunch caught up with Terry Myerson and others from the Truveta team to chat through an important product update from the company. This publication has covered Truveta for some time now, curious about its objectives as a business that has a strong public-health component, and because Myerson was a longtime Microsoft denizen that we were familiar with from covering Windows for years and years.

Our interest was also piqued late last year when Truveta raised $100 million, slightly more than doubling its capital base. With around $200 million in backing, Truveta had a roster of folks with whom we were familiar, and enough cash to bring to bear whatever it was dreaming up.

The Truveta concept is simple: Work with different healthcare groups to collect anonymized patient data, pool the information and make it available to third parties so that they can see what’s actually going on in terms of patient outcomes in a more holistic sense. The potential public health and commercial applications are reasonably apparent, but what struck your scribe when chatting with Myerson and the team was that this sort of aggregated database of depersonalized information was not already in existence.

While having a private-public healthcare system has some advantages, centralized data is seemingly not one of them.

Back to the recent: Truveta has expanded the roster of health systems contributing to its dataset from a handful toward the end of 2021 to 25 today. More data is good when it comes to this sort of “healthcare analytics” work, so the additional 11 providers matter.

But more notably, Truveta’s software product launched earlier this month. Back in 2021, the company made a bit of a splash when it rolled out a COVID-focused product. Now, Truveta Studio is out, and I got a tour.

Something that Truveta has to handle is harmonizing information from disparate systems. This is something it’s tackling, allowing users to set up definitions in a computable format, and then collect results and graph them. The resulting wall of charts and graphs is exciting to look at if you, like myself, are a huge dork for data visualization.

The service is not something, from my run-through of it, that anyone with a passing interest in healthcare outcomes could use. But for an expert, it could pay off — our tour guide explained that, in his prior research environment, he would spend weeks executing what he can do in minutes with Truveta. That’s more than an order of magnitude of time savings. Provided that the service is sufficiently user-friendly for professionals, the company could be onto something.

The question now is how much people — customers — want to use it. Truveta’s early goals — getting its data ingestion set up, raising money, building a team, and then a product for regular use — have been met. Now we are down to the business brass-tacks of the effort. And there are nine figures of capital wagered that it will succeed.

Given that healthcare in the United States is exorbitantly expensive, opaque and full of inequitable outcomes, folks working to make it a bit less impossible to parse are fine by me."
May 25 2023,Louisiana bill banning trans healthcare killed off – by just one vote,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/05/25/louisiana-fred-mills-matt-walsh,"LGBTQ+ activists in Louisiana are celebrating following a vote to kill a proposed gender-affirming care ban for trans youth – thanks to a Republican senator.

State senators voted to strike down Louisiana House Bill 648 on Wednesday (24 May) after a Republican lawmaker crossed the floor to vote with every elected Democrat.

Pharmacist and Republican senator Fred Mills argued prior to the vote that he trusts physicians to make the right decisions for their patients and, as such, saw no need for the bill.

“I always, in my heart of hearts, have believed that a decision should be made by a patient and a physician,” he said.

If passed, the bill would have effectively banned gender-affirming care for under-18s in Louisiana – including the prescription of physically reversible puberty blockers – by imposing sanctions on medical organisations that prescribe them.

It also bans gender-affirming surgeries, despite no medical organisation anywhere in the US performing them on under-18s.

Mills’ decision to vote against the anti-LGBTQ+ bill has been met with vehement backlash from Republicans and right-wing conservatives such as self-described theocratic fascist Matt Walsh, who said Mills would “regret” the decision.

But, as Mills explained in an interview following the vote, he doesn’t care what Matt Walsh and other critics think.

“Why should I [vote for the bill]?” he said. “They don’t live in District 22. They don’t have a 337 area code. I didn’t run for office to serve those people.”

He explained that a study by the Louisiana Health Department on gender-affirming health care helped influence his decision on the vote.

It found that no gender-affirming procedures were performed on minors under Medicaid between 2017 to 2021, and that prescriptions of puberty blockers were also exceedingly rare.

“My decision was really, really based on the numbers,” Mills continued. “All the testimony I heard by the proponents that children are getting mutilated, I didn’t see it in the statistics.”

Senior officials at the Human Rights Campaign commended Mills’ decision and the subsequent killing of the bill, saying that Louisiana lawmakers “did the right thing today”.

State legislative director Cathryn Oakley said: “They heard the voices of transgender kids, their families, and medical experts who bravely shared their stories and chose to treat transgender children with dignity and respect.

“Gender-affirming care is recommended by the entire mainstream American medical establishment for transgender youth. Age-appropriate, medically necessary, gender-affirming healthcare saves lives.”

The Senate is yet to vote on two more anti-LGBTQ+ bills – HB466, a ‘Don’t Say Gay’ copycat, and HB81, which would force schools to misgender trans children.

Democratic governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards has condemned the bills, saying that they would increase “suicidal ideation” among trans children.

“These kinds of bills do not tend to help with that,” he said in a press conference on 11 May.

“In fact, they aggravate the situation and then cause it to be worse.”"
Oct 24 2022,Simple Fix for Healthcare: Give Patients More Responsibility,Sally Pipes,right,https://www.newsmax.com/sallypipes/health-care/2022/10/24/id/1093142/,"Health costs have been rising at an astounding rate. Insurers believe that overuse of medical care and poor individual health habits are big reasons why, according to a new study from insurance advisory firm Willis Towers Watson.

That conclusion runs counter to the narrative common among progressives that patients are hapless victims of a profit-driven health care system. There's plenty of evidence showing that individual choices deserve more of the blame for the steady rise in U.S. health costs.

Critics of the U.S. system often complain that, despite spending more than any country on health care, America has some of the worst outcomes. And they have a point.

In 2020, health care spending grew by nearly 10% over the previous year, reaching $4.1 trillion, or $12,530 per patient. Switzerland, the country with the second-highest per capita health expenditures, spent roughly $5,000 less.

Those high expenditures don't appear to be buying Americans extra years of life. U.S. life expectancy has declined in recent years and is well below that of other developed countries.

But it's a mistake to suggest that high costs and poor outcomes are an inevitable result of our health system. And that's because, in a great many cases, the lifestyle choices of individual patients are the culprit.

By one estimate, over 42% of adults in this country are obese, and over 9% are severely obese. Deaths from drug overdose rose by 30% in 2020 and another 15% in 2021.

Alcohol abuse rates have been rising steadily for years among many demographic groups. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 15% of adults are physically inactive, engaging in no ""leisure-time physical activities.""

Given the prevalence of these unhealthy behaviors, is it any wonder America spends so much on health care, or that the nation's health outcomes are poorer than our peers'?

This reality hasn't escaped the notice of insurers. According to the Willis Towers Watson study, over half of insurers point to poor health habits as a major cause of high health care costs.

It's also notable that 75% of insurers believe overuse of medical care is a serious source of health care inflation — up from 64% last year.

It's tempting to blame providers for this second problem, as doctors are the ones ordering tests and prescribing treatment. But here, too, patients bear some of the responsibility.

Consider the ""better safe than sorry"" philosophy patients often adopt regarding medical care. This can take many forms, such as requesting antibiotics as a precaution, regardless of whether one's condition warrants the treatment.

It's also not uncommon for patients to seek tests, not to identify their illness, but to discover if they're sick at all.

Insisting on high-tech testing techniques like an MRI scan over less sophisticated alternatives is yet another example of this maximalist attitude toward testing.

Providers sometimes employ a ""better safe than sorry"" philosophy, too. They worry about being sued for medical malpractice. Ordering that extra test could immunize them from a lawsuit claiming negligence.

The annual cost of such defensive medicine is in the tens of billions of dollars.

Americans with insurance often pay little to nothing for marginal tests and procedures. Their health plans pick up the tab. So they're largely insensitive to costs — not just the financial costs of their care but the costs their lifestyles exact on their health.

We can address this dysfunction — and give patients a greater incentive to take care of themselves — by putting them in charge of their health care spending. Third-party payers like insurers have little incentive to promote good health among their beneficiaries; it's easier to just raise premiums, which employers typically pay.

If patients had responsibility for their own health care dollars, they'd seriously consider whether a marginal test or procedure is worth the cost. And because they'd keep whatever they didn't spend, they'd have a strong incentive to mind their health.

The U.S. health care system's high costs are largely a function of the preferences — and needs — of the patients it serves. If we want costs to come down, we'll need to deputize patients to make that happen by giving them responsibility for more of their own health care."
May 20 2023,Nebraska passes trans youth healthcare ban despite heroic filibuster efforts,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/05/20/nebraska-megan-hunt-gender-affirming-care,"Nebraska lawmakers have passed a gender-affirming care ban despite attempts to blockade the bill for over three months.

A final vote of 33-15 on Friday (19 May) saw Legislative Bill 574 pass through to governor Jim Pillen after months of filibustering by two Democratic representatives, including House member Megan Hunt.

Not only does the bill effectively ban gender-affirming care for transgender youth, including physically reversible puberty blockers, but it was also amended earlier in May to include a 10-week abortion ban.

The amendment was added following the failure of a similar anti-abortion bill – which would have banned termination procedures after six weeks – by just a single vote after Republican Merv Riepe abstained from voting.

The state’s capitol was filled with protestors calling for lawmakers to “kill this bill” while chanting “keep kids alive”.

Following the vote, House representative Hunt, who is under investigation after lawmakers accused her of a conflict of interest for having a trans son, said: “You 33 members do not represent the will of Nebraskans.

“You are more radical than Nebraskans,” she continued. “You should know that there’s going to be a lawsuit if you pass this bill, with numerous plaintiffs, and the taxpayers are going to pay for that.

“I lost so much this session in terms of relationships with all of you. But I gained a hundredfold in relationships with the people I know who support me and my family – the people who I found out have the back of the LGBTQ+ community and women in Nebraska.”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) described the bill’s passing as “unacceptable” and called for state activists to “fight back” by notifying representatives about their opposition to LB574.

Additionally, the ACLU referenced an open letter signed by over 200 businesses operating in Nebraska that condemned the bill and those like it as “discouraging and disappointing”.

It argued that the laws create a hostile environment in the state, causing LGBTQ+ people and allies to move away from Nebraska, which it said causes “major competitive risks”.

“The next generation of workers aren’t just wanting inclusive environments, they are demanding it,” the letter read.

The Human Rights Campaign’s state legislative director, Cathryn Oakley, joined the chorus of condemnation against the bill, saying that lawmakers had “the audacity” to title the bill the ‘Let Them Grow Act’.

“In reality, this legislation will make it difficult or impossible for a transgender or non-binary child to grow up as their authentic self,” Oakley said. “Age-appropriate, medically necessary gender-affirming care is life-saving healthcare. Period.

“It’s supported by every mainstream American medical and mental health organisation – representing millions of providers in the United States. Yet, politicians on a crusade to prove their extremism to the far fringes of their base clearly see it as a cheap political ploy.”

During a concert on Satuday (19 May), the singer Lizzo shared her dismay at the bill’s passing, saying to the thousands of fans cheering for her: “Don’t let anyone tell you who you are. These laws aren’t real. You are real.”"
May 17 2023,Missouri attorney general ends rule banning trans healthcare for kids and adults,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/05/17/missouri-andrew-bailey-gender-affirming-care,"Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey has issued an order ending a rule that would have limited gender-affirming care for both children and adults.

The legislation, introduced in April, was one of the most severe anti-trans rules introduced in the United States, and would have seen gender-affirming care banned for all ages unless strict conditions were met. A requirement of three years of medically documented gender dysphoria and mandated therapy would have been needed for adults to access care.

Gender-affirming care would also have been limited for autistic people, and those suffering depression or anxiety.

Bailey, a Republican, issued the emergency order on 13 April.

The rule was described as “terrifying”, with advocates warning it would result in “mass medical detransitioning” for trans people in Missouri.

Bailey’s proposed ban was temporarily halted by a judge on 27 April after Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a petition to block the regulations.

Lambda Legal announced on Tuesday (16 May) that Bailey had issued an order terminating the anti-trans emergency rule, but warned that, despite the victory, attacks on trans people in the state would still continue.

Nora Huppert, a staff attorney at Lambda Legal, explained: “While the immediate threat and unprecedented reach of the attorney general’s emergency rule will end, we are fully aware that the Missouri legislature continues to train its sights on Missouri’s trans community.”

A new ban on gender-affirming care for minors in Missouri was passed in early May, as well as a ban on trans people playing for sports teams that match their lived gender. The two anti-trans laws were described by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) as a “shameful abuse of power”.

“SB49 would deny adolescent transgender Missourians access to evidence-based treatment supported by the overwhelming medical consensus. The fight against these dangerous and unprecedented attacks is far from over,” Huppert said.

HRC said that it is currently monitoring more than 520 anti-LGBTQ+ bills that have been introduced in state houses across the country, with more than 220 of them aimed at restricting the rights of transgender people."
Mar 21 2023,County officials spend $1.2m to avoid paying for trans woman’s healthcare,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/03/21/georgia-houston-county-anna-lange,"A county in the US state of Georgia reportedly spent at least $1.2 million just to prevent paying for a trans woman’s gender-affirming care.

Officials in Houston County Georgia deemed the affirming healthcare for deputy sheriff Anna Lange was too expensive for it to cover – but spent more than a million dollars on private lawyers to prevent her treatment.

Lange had worked for the Houston County Sheriff’s Office for over 10 years when she came out to colleagues in 2017. She then requested gender-affirmation surgery under her health insurance plan.

After being told by officials her plan would not cover the related surgeries, she appealed and was denied a right to care several times.

During that time, county sheriff Cullen Talton reportedly told Lange that he thought she was joking when she came out and, upon being told that she was serious, said he didn’t “believe in” being transgender.

According to a report by ProPublica, Lange then began to use her own savings and retirement fund to pay for chest surgery treatment in 2018, but found it hard to afford sexual-reassignment surgery (SRS).

After trying and failing several times to petition for the county to include gender-affirming care in its healthcare coverage, she called once again for the restrictions to be scrapped in 2019 at a board of commissioners’ meeting.

“The sheriff might not endorse my transition, but as long as I work hard for him and maintain a high level of efficiency for Houston County, that’s what is most important,” she said.

“I pay the same taxes and premiums as every other Houston County citizen, yet I do not receive equal coverage in medical care.

“Gender dysphoria is recognised by all major medical associations as being medically necessary,” she continued. “I’m asking for you all tonight to vote to remove this exclusion.”

After being once again denied the equal healthcare she deserved, Lange filed a suit against the county for employment discrimination.

After working with attorneys in a similar case in 2019 – in which a transgender employee successfully sued Georgia University for $100,000 in damages and access to gender-affirming care – Lange chose to sue the county for being subjected to “inferior treatment”.

After a year of legal wrangling between Lange’s lawyers and the county, things began to look up when the Supreme Court ruled that employment discrimination based on transgender status was illegal in 2020.

Eventually, after almost three years, the court ruled in her favour, awarding her $60,000 for “emotional pain and mental anguish”.

But she didn’t see her money until March this year after an appeal by the county prolonged the process even further.

Following a ruling by judge Marc Treadwell that Houston County was “irresponsible” for its attempt to misrepresent the cost of Lange’s procedure, they were forced to pay damages.

It was later revealed that the county had paid $1.2 million to fight the case, compared to the estimated $25,600 that Lange’s surgery would have cost.

The cost of gender-affirming care that Lange requested represents less than three per cent of what Houston County spent battling against her claim."
Mar 21 2023,"A drug-resistant fungus is spreading in U.S. healthcare facilities, CDC says",Deseret News,center,https://deseret.com/2023/3/21/23649866/drug-resistant-fungus-ucandida-auris-us-healthcare,"This 2016 photo made available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a strain of Candida auris cultured in a petri dish at a CDC laboratory. Cases have increased drastically since 2019, with more than 2,000 cases reported in 2022 across the United States.

Candida auris is a drug-resistant yeast first identified in Japan in 2009, and it has been in the United States since 2016. In recent years, there has been a steep increase in cases that concern the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Even though C. auris was named after the Latin word “ear” because it was first found in the ear canal of a patient, it affects more than that by entering the body through the bloodstream, or even the lungs, causing serious invasive infections.

Candida auris can be drug-resistant

The yeast is difficult to distinguish from common yeast with normal lab procedures and has a resistance to strong drugs in particular strains, the CDC said.

A new study published in Annals of Internal Medicine by the CDC said, that cases have been increasing since 2019, with a 40% increase in 2019, a 95% increase in 2021, and an 80% increase in 2022.

“The rise in echinocandin-resistant cases and evidence of transmission is particularly concerning because echinocandins are first-line therapy for invasive Candida infections, including C. auris,” said the study.

Both, drug resistance and difficulty to identify the fungus have contributed to outbreaks in healthcare facilities such as hospitals across the states.

From January 2022 to December, the CDC reported 2,377 clinical cases in the United States, a big uptick from the 500 cases in 2019. By the end of 2022, more than half of the United States had anywhere from zero to 100 cases, with the most reported in Nevada, California and Florida.

The increase in cases could be because of the outbreak of the previous COVID-19 pandemic, which likely put the yeast on the back burner as health care personnel responded to the virus, reported The New York Times. Dr. Meghan Lyman of the CDC’s mycotic diseases branch told the Times that the spread was “concerning but not surprising.”

Older patients who live in nursing homes or patients already in the hospital who have ventilators, feeding tubes, or IVs are more at risk than younger patients. About 30 to 60% of patients with a confirmed case have died, but the CDC said it’s still unclear if the yeast killed the patient or simply expedited the process with their “other serious illnesses.”

After some successful containment in Illinois and New York, Lyman told The New York Times that “it’s not a hopeless situation” and is optimistic about future containment.

Although, she said as lead author in the study, “these findings highlight the need for improved detection and infection control practices to prevent spread of C. auris.”

Jul 15 2023,'Exciting times ahead': New Billings medical school partnering with three local healthcare organizations,KTVQ 2,center,https://ktvq.com/news/local-news/exciting-times-ahead-new-billings-medical-school-partnering-with-three-local-healthcare-organizations,"BILLINGS — Billings has long been the medical hub of Montana. Starting one week from Monday, the community will grow even larger, as classes at Rocky Vista University Montana College of Osteopathic Medicine officially begin. On Saturday, the public got its first chance to tour the new 138,000-square-foot campus.

“The purpose of today’s event is to showcase our amazing new medical school building to the public. There’s been a lot of people locally who have been driving by through this construction process for over a year with a lot of curiosity,"" said Dr. David Park, the vice president and founding dean of the school, on Saturday. ""So today’s a day for them to come and get a closer look and see what’s inside. It’s also an opportunity for the people to interact with our amazing faculty and staff, who are really the ones responsible for the amazing education that the medical students here will receive.""

Kelsey Merison/MTN News Rocky Vista University Montana School of Osteopathic Medicine

A day of excitement at the new West End school, located at 4130 Rocky Vista Way in Billings, that will soon welcome 80 students.

“We’re in a growing process. We’re starting with 80 students this year in the first incoming class. Next year will be 120, and then in the third year we’ll max out at 160 students per year, per class,"" Park said. ""We’re constantly growing our faculty and staff, and we’ll have approximately 120 full-time and part-time faculty working in this building doing the education.""

Kelsey Merison/MTN News Dr. David Park

Students and staff eagerly await July 24, the first official day of classes at the university, which is Montana’s first full-time medical school.

Saturday's open house drew in a curious crowd.

“The public here, they’re just excited about a medical school right here in Montana,"" Park said. ""There’s so much interest from grandparents, parents, and their children about the possibility of them becoming a physician and not having to leave the state.""

Kelsey Merison/MTN News Some of Saturday's guests

The school has been working with St. Vincent Healthcare and RiverStone Health since the beginning phases of planning.

""SCL Intermountain Health and RiverStone Health, we are so grateful for their steadfast commitment and support of us from the very beginning,” Park said.

Billings Clinic recently joined forces, which might come as a shock after a rocky start.

“Billings Clinic, we are extremely thrilled with our renewed engagement and the collaborative work that we’ll be doing together with our organizations,” Park said.

In March of 2021, officials at Billings Clinic publicly came out against Rocky Vista, stating it would not work with the school. But that all changed after some major conversations.

""We’ve had a conversation with RVU going back for quite a while,"" said Dr. Clint Seger, the CEO of Billings Clinic, on Saturday. ""But you know, as the school has been built and our conversations with the leadership here (continued), we really felt that this was an opportunity for a new day of conversation for how we could really partner together to look to the future.""

Kelsey Merison/MTN News Dr. Clint Seger

Now looking to the future and planning exciting next steps for students to be involved.

""The students are a couple years from needing to come to a healthcare facility like Billings Clinic,"" Seger said. ""And so what that looks like will be worked out, I’m sure, over the next two years in conversation with leadership from Rocky Vista.”

Kelsey Merison/MTN News Checking out the new school

Rocky Vista leadership is already mapping things out.

“80 students who are starting on July 24, they’ll finish their first and second year of education right here on this campus,"" Park said. ""And then in their third year, they’ll start doing their clinical rotations. This means that they’re going to take what they’ve learned in the first and second years, and then start applying that to real patients.""

While it may seem like a ways away, all parties are eagerly awaiting clinical rotations in 2025 and the future of the new school.

“The success of any medical school really relies a lot on the infrastructure of the clinical rotations and clinical education with partnering hospitals and clinics. So we are absolutely excited about the amazing opportunities that we’ve had in collaborating with them,” Park said. “The success of where we are today is truly a testament to the amazing support of our community here in Billings and the region."""

Mar 10 2023,Congress Members' Social Security Numbers Compromised in Healthcare Data Hack,RollingStone.com,left,https://rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/healthcare-data-hack-congress-1234694794,"The personal information—including social security numbers—of more than 56,000 people were compromised in a hack of a healthcare marketplace for DC lawmakers and residents. According to a report from The New York Times, federal investigators informed congressional leadership on Friday that they had identified the personal information of members of the House, Senate, their families and staffers on the dark web as a result of the breach.

The D.C. Health Link marketplace provides services to more than 100,000 individuals, including 11,000 members of Congress and Capitol Hill staffers. The breach, which includes social security information, birth dates, addresses, and phone numbers of affected individuals was originally discovered on Wednesday.

In a joint email sent Wednesday by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, originally obtained by Politico, the House leadership stated that “This breach significantly increases the risk that members, staff, and their families will experience identity theft, financial crimes, and physical threats — already an ongoing concern.”

“Right now, our top priority is protecting the safety and security of anyone in the Capitol Hill community affected by the cyber hack,” McCarthy and Jeffries wrote.

On Friday the The D.C. Health Benefit Exchange Authority indicated that they were working with both Capitol Police and federal law enforcement to track down the source of the hack. D.C. Health Link officials have indicated they have reached out to affected individuals with an offer of data protection services.

The House Administration Committee indicated on Wednesday that it would be launching an investigation into the data hack. The committee tweeted that “Chairman [Bryan] Steil is aware of the breach and is working with the CAO to ensure the vendor takes necessary steps to protect the PII of any impacted member, staff, and their families.”"

Aug 26 2022,Tech companies are still figuring out their healthcare lanes,The Verge,left,https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321851/amazon-care-tech-health-google-apple,"It was only last year that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, called Amazon Care one of the most exciting innovations at the company. But on Wednesday, employees learned that Amazon Care would shut down at the end of the year, an abrupt end to a program once central to its plans to reshape healthcare.

The abrupt shutdown doesn’t mean Amazon is getting out of healthcare — it might just mean a reframing. It recently bought the subscription-based primary care company One Medical, which offers similar services to Amazon Care. Reports indicate Amazon is also interested in at-home healthcare technology company Signify Health. Amazon still wants to take on healthcare, but it’s clarifying its approach: instead of building from scratch, it’s taking over things that already work.

Other tech giants are going through a similar process of honing their healthcare strategies. When companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple first started forecasting their health-related ambitions around five years ago, the goals were lofty — disrupt and redefine the multi-trillion-dollar healthcare industry in the United States.

Early attempts to swing big were less than successful. Amazon partnered with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to try to create its own healthcare company for employees from scratch, and that venture collapsed in 2021. Apple tried to create its own primary care service, but data integrity issues raised by employees derailed the project. Google disbanded its Health division last summer and redistributed its health efforts across other teams. Many Big Tech efforts to contribute to COVID-19 response efforts fell flat.

Until recently, Amazon Care seemed to be moving in a positive direction — it expanded nationwide and had customers like Hilton and Silicon Labs. But according to a memo from Amazon senior vice president of health Neil Lindsay, it wasn’t a “complete enough offering” that big customers wanted to see in a healthcare product. Health professionals working with Amazon Care told The Washington Post that they were concerned about patient safety.

With the deal to acquire One Medical, they’d have another issue with Amazon Care — combining two different data systems, says Brendan Keeler, a product manager at health technology company Zus Health and expert on healthcare data systems. Looking at both, it makes sense that they’d focus on One Medical rather than trying to build a new primary care service from the ground up, he says. The process of building Amazon Care gave Amazon a better understanding of what healthcare solutions should look like, Lindsay said in his memo. One Medical might fit that picture better — and it comes off the shelf as a complete offering.

Amazon is good at the customer experience side of things but doesn’t have as much expertise with the service that’s actually being delivered in this case: healthcare. “Healthcare is hard, and they’re smart enough to see the right strategy for them,” Keeler says. “It’s them looking at their bets and saying, buying proven solutions, Amazon-fying them, and scaling them is how we get where we want to go.”

It’s a similar approach to the one Amazon took with its pharmacy programs. It bought pharmacy startup PillPack in 2018. Then, in 2020, it launched Amazon Pharmacy, which also offers home delivery for prescriptions — and was built on top of PillPack.

Like Amazon, Google and Apple are looking to carve out the parts of healthcare that actually make sense for them. For Google, maybe that’s developing algorithms and backend tools that it could then pass off to health organizations to use. Apple is good at consumer tech — delivering care itself might not be its approach, but smartwatch features and easy-to-use personal health records are more in its zone. “It makes more sense that the inroads they make is bringing their particular expertise in a way that they can only do because of their scale,” Keeler says.

Tech expertise was never going to be a magic cure-all to the many, many problems plaguing the American healthcare system. It’s an unwieldy, inequitable, tentacled beast held together by fax machines and taken to its breaking point by the pandemic. The early failures and growing pains weren’t a surprise to people who work in healthcare and understand its sheer complexity. But tech interest in health isn’t new or shiny anymore, and if the companies want to keep pushing into the space, they’re going to have to find the corner of it that makes sense for them."
Jun 08 2023,Louisiana Senate passes Don't Say Gay bill and ban on healthcare for trans kids,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/06/08/louisiana-lgbtq-dont-say-gay,"Louisiana lawmakers have sent a package of anti-LGBTQ+ bills to the Democratic governor for his signature, including a ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth.

The proposed laws, which includes an imitation of Florida’s Don’t Say Gay bill, passed through a final vote by the House on Tuesday (6 June).

The bill banning gender-affirming care, House Bill 648, has caused controversy over the past few months after it was originally struck down by a House committee by just one Republican vote.

Pharmacist and Republican senator Fred Mills argued that the bill, which would impose sanctions on those prescribing potentially life-saving healthcare to under-18s, is unnecessary and he trusted physicians to make the right decisions.

“I always, in my heart of hearts, have believed that a decision should be made by a patient and a physician,” he said.

A group of state Republicans reissued the bill for consideration by the senate judiciary, which passed it in a six-minute hearing on 2 June.

It has since been rushed through the state capitol’s law-making process, passing through a final House vote just four days after it was recommitted.

Governor John Bel Edwards has not explicitly stated whether he intends to sign the new bills into law, but has signalled his opposition to anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in the past.

HB 648 would effectively ban physically reversible puberty blockers from trans youth by threatening the removal of the medical licences of those who prescribe them, as well as leaving them open to potential lawsuits.

Additionally, it bans gender-affirming surgeries for trans youth, despite no medical organisation operating on those under the age of 15.

In a statement following the bill’s passing, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Louisiana urged governor Bel Edwards to veto the legislation to prevent further harm to the trans community.

“This is a dark day in Louisiana,” the ACLU’s statement said. “Lawmakers have turned their backs on democratic processes, science, parental rights and the health and safety of children.

“Our hearts break for transgender youth in our state who have repeatedly been attacked by their own elected leaders for political gain.”

Republican senator says vote against anti-trans bill was ‘based on the numbers’

After voting against the bill in May, Mills said his decision was based upon his experience as a pharmacist.

Following days of Republican backlash, including from self-described theocratic fascist Matt Walsh, Mills told the press that he didn’t care what his critics think.

“Why should I [vote for the bill]?” he said. “They don’t live in district 22. They don’t have a 337 area code. I didn’t run for office to serve those people.”

Mills explained that, during testimony, he believed claims about child mutilation by anti-LGBTQ+ pundits weren’t represented in statistics published by the Louisiana Health Department in March.

The report found that no gender-affirming procedures were performed on minors under Medicaid – the government healthcare insurers – between 2017 and 2021, and that prescriptions of puberty blockers were also exceedingly rare.

“My decision was based on the numbers,” Mills continued. “All the testimony I heard by the proponents that children are getting mutilated, I didn’t see it in the statistics.”

In a statement following the bill’s revival, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), who had previously commended Mills for his vote, said proponents of the bills “show no shame in assaulting the freedoms of those different from them”.

HRC state legislative director Cathryn Oakley said: “These bills are a desperate and cruel effort by radical politicians in Louisiana to marginalise and erase the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender youth.

“The Human Rights Campaign strongly condemns these discriminatory bills and calls on governor Bel Edwards to veto them.”"
Mar 01 2023,Mississippi has banned gender-affirming healthcare for anyone under 18,LGBTQ Nation,left,https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2023/03/mississippi-has-banned-gender-affirming-healthcare-for-anyone-under-18/,"On Tuesday, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves (R) signed H.B. 1125, known as the “Regulate Experimental Adolescent Procedures (REAP) Act” into law. As Axios notes, the law, which went into effect immediately, prohibits the provision of “gender transition procedures,” including puberty blockers and gender reassignment surgeries, to anyone under the age of 18.

Under the new law, healthcare workers who provide gender-affirming care to minors will have their licenses revoked. It also allows patients to sue healthcare providers up to 30 years after receiving treatment, and denies state or federal funding to state organizations that provide gender-affirming care to minors.

Gender-affirming care for both adolescents and adults has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychiatric Association, and many other professional groups as necessary and frequently lifesaving for transgender individuals. Recent research suggests that gender-affirming care like hormone therapy improves the mental health of transgender youth experiencing gender dysphoria.

During a signing ceremony on Tuesday, Reeves parroted anti-trans claims that have been largely debunked by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

“There is a dangerous movement spreading across America today. It’s advancing under the guise of a false ideology and pseudo-science. It’s being pushed onto our children through radical activists, social media, and online influencers,” Reeves claimed. “It’s trying to convince our children that they are in the wrong body. This dangerous movement attempts to convince these children that they are just a surgery away from happiness.”

“This is truly scary stuff that’s being pushed upon our kids and, yes, their loving parents,” Reeves continued. “They’re being taken advantage of, all so some can push their warped view on gender or appear to be ‘woke’ for their friends.”

Anti-transgender advocates often claim that young people who are only coming out as transgender or nonbinary in greater numbers because of “social contagion,” that is, social pressure to do so. However, a 2022 study found that this hasn’t actually increased the number of trans-identifying adolescents who live in 16 different U.S. states.

Reeves was joined at the ceremony by anti-trans filmmaker and Daily Wire columnist Matt Walsh as well as activists from Alliance Defending Freedom and Madison County Moms for Liberty, two organizations that oppose the expansion of LGBTQ+ civil rights.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Mickie Stratos, president of The Spectrum Center of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, which provides health services and advocacy for LGBTQ+ people, characterized Reeves’s decision to sign the bill as “an act of violence.”

“He and the lawmakers who pushed this bill in Mississippi are willfully ignoring the unique needs of transgender young people, interfering with their medical care and sending a stigmatizing, exclusionary message,” Stratos said.

Mississippi is now the third state to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Utah and South Dakota passed similar legislation earlier this year.

Other similar laws passed in Arkansas and Alabama have been halted by court challenges. Last April, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Alabama to block S.B. 184, a state law signed by Gov. Kay Ivey last year that would criminalize gender-affirming medical care for trans youth. Previously the DOJ had filed a brief in 2021 supporting doctors and transgender families suing the state of Arkansas for a similar ban."

Apr 16 2023,Missouri AG introduces 'exceptionally cruel' limit on life-saving trans healthcare,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/04/16/missouri-attorney-general-andrew-bailey-trans-healthcare,"Missouri’s attorney general has introduced an “exceptionally cruel” anti-trans rule that severely limits gender-affirming care for people of all ages in the state.

Andrew Bailey’s move means gender-affirming care for all trans people has been pretty much banned, with strict requirements – including the need for all trans people to have three years of “long-lasting, persistent and intense pattern of gender dysphoria” – needing to be met in order to obtain care.

The anti-trans rule also requires all trans people to undergo 18 months of therapy sessions designed to “explore influences on the patient’s gender identity and mental-health comorbidities”.

Before gender-affirming care is permitted, the rule requires “any psychiatric systems from existing mental-health comorbidities”, such as depression and anxiety, to be resolved – and the rule includes a ban on care for trans adults with autism.

The rule also sets out a requirement to check for “social contagion” and requires 15 years of medical follow-ups for all trans adults.

Collectively, and taking into account that many trans people suffer with depression or anxiety before gender-affirming care, the requirements would ban the vital care for most adults in Missouri.

The World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s (WPATH) standards of care guide warns against prolonged waits for gender-affirming care, stating that this should begin promptly for trans adults unless there is a robust reason to delay.

The organisation also notes that many trans people may have mental health problems and receiving vital treatment can help.

“Like their cisgender counterparts, TGD [transgender and gender-diverse] people may have mental health problems. Treatment for mental health problems can and should occur in conjunction with GAMSTs [gender-affirming medical and/or surgical treatments] when medical transition is needed.

“It is vital gender-affirming care is not impeded unless, in some extremely rare cases, there is robust evidence that doing so is necessary to prevent significant decompensation with a risk of harm to self or others.

“In those cases, it is also important to consider the risks delaying GAMSTs poses to a TGD person’s mental and physical health (Byne et al., 2018).”

In a Twitter post, independent journalist Erin Reed described the provisions as exceptionally cruel.

“Your regulation is going to die the moment it hits court,” she wrote. “You literally advocate for conversion therapy.

“Unfortunately for you, no matter how many laws you pass, you can’t hold back the rising tide of trans acceptance in society, and ultimately, you will lose this fight.”

Bailey said that “the left” had refused to report all the facts and referred to “the science behind protecting our children from these procedures”.

Your regulation is going to die the moment it hits Court.



You literally advocate for conversion therapy.



Unfortunately for you, no matter how many laws you pass, you can’t hold back the rising tide of trans acceptance in society.



And ultimately, you will lose this fight. — Erin Reed (@ErinInTheMorn) April 14, 2023

A US-based study published by the New England Journal of Medicine in January revealed that gender-affirming care improves the mental health of trans teens.

The study, which followed young trans people for two years while they were treated with life-changing hormone therapy, evaluated 315 transgender youths aged between 12 and 20, with the average participant being 16.

It found that participants reported an increase in positive emotions, life satisfaction and improved self-confidence, and also highlighted participants reporting less anxiety and a decrease in depression."

May 25 2023,ACLU of Louisiana Celebrates Defeat of Bill to Ban Life-Saving Healthcare for Transgender Youth,Minden Press-Herald,not-yet-rated,https://press-herald.com/aclu-of-louisiana-celebrates-defeat-of-bill-to-ban-life-saving-healthcare-for-transgender-youth,"BATON ROUGE – The ACLU of Louisiana released the following statement upon the Senate Health and Welfare Committee’s deferral of House Bill 648, a bill that would have banned gender-affirming care for transgender children in Louisiana:

“The Senate Health and Welfare Committee has chosen to protect Louisiana’s transgender children by rejecting HB648. This is a powerful win for transgender children and their families. We lift up and celebrate the incredible families, advocates, providers, and lawmakers who worked to stop this dangerous bill that targeted transgender children and stripped rights from their parents.

“The fight to protect the rights of transgender children and their families is far from over. But make no mistake, as states across the country pass harmful bills that mirror HB648, today’s committee vote matters, and sends a powerful message that will be heard nationwide.”"
Dec 03 2013,Healthcare.gov: Is it fixed now?,Christian Science Monitor,center,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2013/1203/Healthcare.gov-Is-it-fixed-now,"Counselors helping people use the federal government's online health exchange are giving mixed reviews to the updated site, with some zipping through the application process while others are facing the same old sputters and even crashes.

The Obama administration had promised a vastly improved shopping experience on healthcare.gov by the end of November, and Monday was the first business day since the date passed.

Brokers and online assisters in Utah say three of every four people successfully signed up for health coverage on the online within an hour of logging in. A state official overseeing North Dakota's navigators said he had noticed improvements in the site, as did organizations helping people sign up in parts of Alabama and Wisconsin.

But staffers at an organization in South Florida and a hospital group with locations in Iowa and Illinois said they have seen no major improvements from the federal website, which 36 states are relying on.

Amanda Crowell, director of revenue cycle for UnityPoint Health-Trinity, which has four hospitals in Iowa and Illinois, said the organization's 15 enrollment counselors did not see a marked improvement on the site.

""We had very high hopes for today, but those hopes were very much quashed,"" said Crowell. She said out of a dozen attempts online only one person was able to get to the point of plan selection, though the person decided to wait.

The site appeared to generally run smoothly early Monday morning before glitches began slowing people down. By 10 a.m., federal health officials deployed a new queue system that stalls new visitors on a waiting page so that those further along in the process can finish their application with fewer problems.

About 750,000 had visited the site by Monday night — about double the traffic for a typical Monday, according to figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Roberta Vann, a certified application counselor at the Hamilton Health Center, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, said the site worked well for her Monday morning but she became frustrated later when the site went down.

""You can get to a point, but it does not allow you to select any plans, you can't get eligibility (information). It stops there,"" she said. ""The thought of it working as well as it was didn't last long.""

In South Florida, John Foley and his team of navigators were only able to successfully enroll one of a handful of return applicants who came to their office before glitches started, including wonky estimates for subsidy eligibility. He worried about how they would fare with the roughly 50 other appointments scheduled later in the week.

Although frustrated, most were not deterred, he said.

""These are people that have policies going away, who have health problems. These are people that are going to be very persistent,"" said Foley, an attorney and certified counselor for Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County.

Despite the Obama administration's team of technicians working around the clock, it's not clear if the site will be able to handle the surge of applicants expected by the Dec. 23 deadline to enroll for coverage starting at the beginning of the year. Many navigators also say they're concerned the bad publicity plaguing the troubled website will prevent people from giving the system another try.

""There's a trust level that we feel like we broke with them. We told them we were here to help them and we can't help them,"" said Valerie Spencer, an enrollment counselor at Sarah Bush Lincoln Center, a small regional hospital in the central Illinois city of Mattoon.

Federal health officials acknowledged the website is still a work in progress. They've also acknowledged the importance of fixing back-end problems as insurers struggle to process applications because of incomplete or inaccurate data. Even when consumers think they've gone through the whole process, their information may not get to the insurer without problems.

""We do know that things are not perfect with the site. We will continue to make improvements and upgrades,"" said Julie Bataille, communications director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

In less than an hour Monday, Starla Redmon, 58, of Paris, Ill., was able to successfully get into a health plan with help from an enrollment counselor. Redmon, who juggles two part-time jobs and has been uninsured for four years, said she was surprised the website worked so well after hearing reports about its problems.

""Everything she typed in, it went through,"" said Redmon, who chose a bronze plan and will pay about $75 a month after a tax credit. ""It was the cheapest plan I could go with.""

Jan 18 2023,NYC Mayor Eric Adams unveils plan to improve women's healthcare,United Press International,center,https://upi.com/amp/Top_News/US/2023/01/18/New-York-City-womens-healthcare-plan/5301674030518,"Jan. 18 (UPI) -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams has unveiled a plan to combat inequality in healthcare that includes expanding the availability of abortion pills at city clinics, launching a sexual education task force and convening experts to create a comprehensive women's health agenda.

The Democratic mayor outlined his so-called women's health agenda Tuesday during a press conference while surrounded by some of the city's healthcare leaders, saying for too long healthcare has been centered around men to the detriment of women.

""Women are the majority of the healthcare consumers. Many suffer from preventable health conditions, yet face more constrains and discrimination than men when it comes to getting care,"" he said.

The mayor painted the stark reality that women in need of medical assistance face, stating they are on average diagnosed four years later than men concerning hundreds of diseases and sometimes wait up to 10 years to be properly diagnosed. One of the most common reasons women seek medical attention, he said, is vaginal discomfort, which is ""misdiagnosed more often than they are correctly diagnosed.""

""To be clear that is worse than a coin flip. We would have a lot more research and care options for women's health if we weren't so afraid of saying the word 'vagina,'"" he said.

""Every New Yorker has a women in their life who has struggled to get the care they need. It is because historically women's health has not been prioritized.""

As part of his agenda, the city from Wednesday will begin rolling out abortion medication to four Department of Health clinics, starting with the Bronx, then to Queens, Harlem and Brooklyn by the end of the year. The expansion is on top of the 11 public hospitals where such medication is already available.

Dr. Leslie Hayes, deputy commissioner for child and family health at the city, told reporters during the press conference that those seeking the medication can schedule an appointment, but the clinics do take walk-ins.

""The medication abortion clinics are going to start tomorrow, will be opening the first one at the Marosena site in the Bronx. And then others will be rolled out after that"" Hayes said. ""Jamaica hospital, Central Harlem and the I believe Fort Greene.""

Under his agenda, they city will also relaunch the city's sexual education task force that will educate young New Yorkers with an aim to ""create a culture of sexual wellness and inclusivity,"" a statement from Adams' office said.

The task force will ensure school staff has a basic understanding of exclusivity and be able to connect students with appropriate sexual health resources outside the classroom setting. It will also increase community support for sexual health education through various campaigns.

Adams said the task force with help to educate young New Yorkers ""about their bodies and break taboos from an earlier age.""

The agenda will also see the city immediately begin tracking rates of various diseases, including cancers and mental health conditions, to better understand the needs regarding women's health, the mayor's office said.

Leaders from various sectors will also be convened in March for a summit focused on ""all aspects of women's health, from research and data collection to programming around chronic disease prevention, reproductive health and mental health,"" in order to produce the city's women's health agenda, Adams said.

The mayor added that his plan will also seek to change the stigma around menopause and create more menopause-friendly workplaces in the city.

""New York City has always been a beacon of leadership in this nation, and we're going to continue to lead,"" he said."
Jul 30 2021,The Bad Science Behind Trans Healthcare Bans,The Verge,left,https://www.theverge.com/22590708/trans-youth-gender-affirming-healthcare-bans-science,"Conservative legislators and special interest groups are using scientific studies as a cudgel in their attempts to limit children’s access to gender affirming healthcare. One of the biggest battles is taking place in Arkansas.

“We can’t act like these studies don’t matter,” Arkansas state Senator Alan Clark said on March 29th, arguing in support of HB 1570, a ban on gender affirming healthcare for minors in Arkansas. Clark was referring to cherry-picked research that depicted various treatments as dangerous, experimental, and unsafe for children.

After a vote, Arkansas became the first state to pass such a bill into law.

The ACLU filed a lawsuit against Arkansas in May challenging the constitutionality of the law. A judge temporarily blocked the ban on July 21st, days before it was set to go into effect. “We were able to show that these laws are irrational,” said ACLU attorney Chase Strangio at a press conference, “we’re going to keep arguing that up through the court system.”

Arkansas is one of 20 states to attempt bans on gender affirming medical care for young people in the last year. All of the bills try to weaponize science — in the form of questionable, outdated, or misinterpreted research — against trans children and their parents while willfully ignoring both the experiences of trans people and the expert opinion of many groups of scientists, scholars, and doctors.

HB 1570 shares nearly identical language with proposed trans healthcare bans that are making their way through legislature in other states. That’s because they’re copy-paste bills based on “model legislature” from a coalition backed by anti-LGBTQ hate groups. Here’s a breakdown of why the arguments presented in these bills don’t hold up to scrutiny.

HB 1570: “For the small percentage of children who are gender nonconforming or experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, studies consistently demonstrate that the majority come to identify with their biological sex in adolescence or adulthood, thereby rendering most physiological interventions unnecessary.”

The idea that many trans kids will grow out of it is referred to in research as desistance. The term comes from criminology, where it describes the process of ceasing criminal behavior. The concept of desistance is often used to remove children’s agency in discussions of their own identities, painting them as confused or going through a phase. It’s also used to advocate for “reparative” conversion therapies, which, unlike gender affirming care, are unethical and dangerous.

The most frequently cited desistance statistic is that around 80 percent of kids who experience gender dysphoria will go on to be cisgender adults. This percentage is usually attributed to four studies, published from 2008 to 2013, which looked at young children at gender identity clinics in Canada and the Netherlands. There are a number of problems with how those studies were carried out and how their findings were interpreted.

All of the studies included children who had not actually expressed gender dysphoria and had instead been deemed gender-nonconforming by their parents. Labeling those children as desistant drastically inflates the percentage. In three of the studies, participants who didn’t follow up with the researchers in adolescence or adulthood were assumed to be desistant, again inaccurately raising the desistance percentage. The methodological issues are further discussed in an article by researchers and in several articles by trans writer and biologist Julia Serano.

The desistance myth is also beside the point because it refers to children younger than those who would be eligible for the physiological interventions listed in the bills. “It’s just not relevant,” says Ashley. “This is a prepubertal population. It’s not the group that’s being offered puberty blockers. Those being offered puberty blockers are the ones that have already not desisted.”

HB 1570: “Even among people who have undergone inpatient gender reassignment procedures, suicide rates, psychiatric morbidities, and mortality rates remain markedly elevated above the background population.”

This line is likely referencing a 2011 study conducted in Sweden, which sponsors of the bill have mentioned specifically in their arguments. That study did find that adult trans participants had higher rates of mental illness, suicide attempts, and death by suicide than cisgender people of the same age.

What the senators failed to mention is that the researchers also acknowledged that gender affirming surgeries alleviate gender dysphoria, and that their findings should inspire better care for trans people after surgery. The researchers state explicitly that their results should not be interpreted to say that gender affirming surgeries increase mortality. The study is also limited in several ways; most notably, its focus was trans people who were treated in the 1970s and ‘80s, and significant improvements in treatment, from mental health care to surgical techniques, have been made since then.

Avery Everhart, a trans medical and legal geographer who studies trans healthcare access, points out another issue with these kinds of studies — it’s difficult to directly compare the mental health of cis and trans kids because there are so many variables to take into account. “It’s not ideal to compare to cisgender, mentally healthy, well-adjusted, youth of the same age, instead you should be comparing to other youth who also experience comorbid issues.”

Trans youth aren’t more predisposed to mental illness and other problems simply by nature of being trans, Everhart says. Living in a transphobic society, where children may not have family support and lawmakers are trying to restrict their rights, is bound to have negative effects on mental health.

“In biomedical research, in general, there’s an assumption that it is better to pathologize the individual,” says Everhart, “as opposed to diagnosing the society that gave them suicidality, that caused them to be depressed, that may have led them to have substance abuse issues.”

HB 1570: “The prescribing of puberty-blocking drugs is being done despite the lack of long-term longitudinal studies evaluating the risks and benefits of using these drugs for the treatment of such distress or gender transition.”

“Puberty blockers have been around a long time, and weren’t invented for trans children,” says Jules Gill-Peterson, trans historian and author of Histories of the Transgender Child. There’s plenty of evidence that they do what they’re supposed to do: delay puberty. They’ve been prescribed for decades for cis children who enter puberty at particularly young ages, and are approved by the FDA for that use. The blockers used for trans and cis children are the same, are only used temporarily, and their effects are reversible.

A lack of long-term studies doesn’t equate to a lack of knowledge about puberty blockers’ risks or benefits for trans children. The use of puberty blockers for trans children is in line with the WPATH Standards of Care and the Endocrine Society’s guidelines. A 2017 review of available evidence determined that puberty suppression is reasonably safe and is associated with improved psychological health. Preliminary results from a longitudinal study in the US suggest lowered depression and suicidal ideation in trans youth on hormone treatments, including puberty blockers.

HB 1570: “Healthcare providers are also prescribing cross-sex hormones for children who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex, despite the fact that no randomized clinical trials have been conducted on the efficacy or safety of the use of cross-sex hormones in adults or children for the purpose of treating such distress or gender transition.”

The lack of randomized clinical trials isn’t really a smoking gun here. It would be unethical to run studies where hormones were given to some people and withheld from others. Like puberty blockers, hormone therapies are prescribed to cisgender people for a variety of reasons. For example, anti-estrogen drugs are recommended for teen cisgender boys with persistent gynecomastia (breast enlargement) who experience psychological distress, though they’re not approved by the FDA for that use. There are no randomized clinical trials for such treatments for cis children. Lawmakers seemingly have no objections to hormone therapies unless they’re used for trans children.

Minors are prescribed hormones after careful consideration and discussion between healthcare providers, children, and their caregivers. There are plenty of barriers and gatekeeping to gender affirming care, and researchers argue that young teens are often capable of making their own decisions about when to start hormones. WPATH, the Endocrine Society, and other medical associations consider hormone therapy safe and beneficial for trans youth.

HB 1570: “It is of grave concern to the General Assembly that the medical community is allowing individuals who experience distress at identifying with their biological sex to be subjects of irreversible and drastic nongenital gender reassignment surgery and irreversible, permanently sterilizing genital gender reassignment surgery, despite the lack of studies showing the benefits of such interventions outweigh the risks.”

Very few minors undergo gender affirming surgeries of any kind, especially genital surgeries. Those who do are usually at least 16 years old and have already been socially and medically transitioning for some time with the guidance of healthcare providers. The WPATH Standards of Care recommend waiting until the age of majority, and having been on hormones for at least a year. It’s also worth noting that the use of puberty blockers can prevent trans children from needing many surgeries later in life.

The vast majority of trans youth do not get any surgeries until they’re over 18, but there is growing evidence that there are benefits to having certain procedures done at a younger age. One study noted that transfeminine patients were more likely to keep up with vaginoplasty aftercare while at home with family members, as opposed to recovering while away at college. Another study of transmasculine people who had chest surgery earlier in life found very low rates of regret, as well as significantly lower dysphoria.

People who oppose trans healthcare rely on fear-mongering language around gender affirming surgeries, using words like “irreversible” and “sterilizing” and making comparisons to mutilation. But bodies go through irreversible changes all the time, from puberty and aging to appendectomies and tonsillectomies.

“It’s a fantasy that the cis body is some sort of organic, naturally developing body that just perfectly unfolds according to nature’s plan, and never undergoes any sorts of significant changes,” says Gill-Peterson. “The human body is fundamentally biologically plastic.”

“Irreversibility makes a couple of assumptions when we see it talked about this way, that it’s a zero sum that something either is or is not reversible, as opposed to on a spectrum,” says Everhart, “some things will return to their previous state, but maybe not fully, others will totally reverse.”

HB 1570: “Gender transition procedures” do not include: (i) Services to persons born with a medically verifiable disorder of sex development including a person with external biological sex characteristics that are irresolvably ambiguous [...] (ii) Services provided when a physician has otherwise diagnosed a disorder of sexual development that the physician has determined through genetic or biochemical testing [...]”

The bill bans surgeries for trans youth, but specifies that the ban doesn’t apply to procedures on intersex people. This exception leaves room for healthcare providers to continue the traumatizing practice of operating on intersex children of all ages without their consent or knowledge. “They’re going to force intersex people to endure the things that they’re withholding from trans people,” says Gill-Peterson.

Unlike medical treatments that trans youth seek out to affirm their identities, procedures done on intersex children, often during infancy, do cause irreversible physical and psychological harm. Medical opinion has shifted away from promoting intersex surgeries as medically necessary, and intersex activists are still calling on hospitals across the country to stop performing them.

“That’s the tell. That’s how you know none of these bills have anything to do with science and are purely ideological,” says Gill-Peterson. “[It’s] all the same medicine for cis, trans, and intersex people. They’re just treated entirely differently now under the law, and I think that’s really, really disturbing.”"
May 01 2023,Judge's ruling will prevent AG's rule restricting trans healthcare until May 15,Springfield News-Leader,center,https://news-leader.com/story/news/local/missouri/2023/05/01/st-louis-co-judge-grants-restraining-order-against-emergency-rule/70170767007,"A St. Louis County judge has granted a temporary restraining order that prevents Attorney General Andrew Bailey's emergency rule from going into effect.

The temporary restraining order is set to expire on May 15, according to court documents, and there will be a preliminary injunction hearing on May 11.

“Today's ruling marks a win for transgender Missourians over an unprecedented attempt by the Attorney General to unilaterally legislate and harm their right to self-expression, bodily autonomy, and access to lifesaving health care,” said Gillian Wilcox, deputy director of litigation for the ACLU of Missouri. “As was clear from the beginning, the Attorney General’s claim of an emergency was proven an untruthful and dangerous attempt to get involved in individual and family medical decisions, showing that he will attack the very people he supposed to serve and protect.”

The ACLU of Missouri and Lambda Legal, along with Bryan Cave Leighton, LLP, are representing Southampton Community Healthcare, Kelly Storck, Logan Casey, and the families of two transgender people in a lawsuit against the attorney general. The rule, which was published April 13, would restrict ""experimental interventions to treat gender dysphoria"" for both adults and minors.

The attorney general's order restricting gender-affirming health care had been set to take effect Thursday, April 27. But after a federal judge blocked an attempt by Bailey's office to move the case out of state court, Judge Ellen Ribaudo delayed implementation to allow time for a ruling on temporary restraining order requested by the groups challenging the rule.

""We remain confident in our position because the Court even acknowledged that it deferred its consideration of the science until a later date. Our six pages of endnotes speak for themselves: these procedures are experimental. We will continue to fight for all patients to have access to adequate health care,"" said Madeline Sieren, press secretary for the attorney general's office.

Since the emergency rule was announced, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region and Southwest Missouri has seen its gender-affirming care patient population double, according to a statement from Yamelsie Rodriguez, president and CEO of PPSLR.

""We remain optimistic that the court will permanently strike down this harmful ban. The Attorney General has no business regulating our patients’ health care, just like transphobia and junk science have no place in health care,"" Rodriguez said. ""Today’s order is encouraging, but we know these attacks will continue. The Attorney General is dead set on denying science and evidence to attack the trans community in the same way his predecessor attacked people seeking an abortion. But we'll never stop standing with and fighting for our patients — we’re here no matter what.""

What is the emergency rule?

Bailey first announced the emergency rule was coming in late March. At that point in time, it was believed the rule would apply only to minors. On April 13, Bailey's office released the official language of the rule, which put restrictions in place for ""experimental interventions to treat gender dysphoria"" for both adults and minors. It also outlined the date that the emergency rule would begin — April 27.

The rule defines ""gender transition intervention"" as prescription or provision of any puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones or surgery for the purpose of transitioning gender, decreasing gender incongruence or treating gender dysphoria.

More:Missouri Attorney General's emergency rule appears to halt all 'experimental' trans care

The emergency rule states it is ""unfair, deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful practice"" for a person or health organization to provide ""gender transition intervention"" to a patient if the health provider or organization:

Fails to annually assess whether the patient continues to have gender dysphoria;

Fails to provide the patient with informed consent about the risks of gender-affirming care;

Fails to ensure that for at least the three most recent consecutive years the patient has exhibited a medically-documented pattern of gender dysphoria;

Fails to ensure the patient has received a ""full psychological or psychiatric assessment,"" consisting of at least 15 separate, hourly sessions over the course of not fewer than 18 months to ""explore the developmental influences on the patient's current gender identity"";

Fails to ensure that any previous mental health diseases have been treated;

Fails to ensure that the patient has received a comprehensive autism screening;

Fails to ensure the patient has received a comprehensive screening for ""social media addiction or compulsion"" and has not, for at least six months, suffered from ""social media addiction or compulsion"";

Fails to annually ensure the patient is not experiencing social contagion, or being influenced by others about their gender identity;

Fails to adopt and follow a procedure to track all negative side effects that may arise from covered gender transition intervention over the course of the first 15 years;

Fails to maintain data about negative side effects in a format that is easily accessible for study or

Fails to obtain and keep on file informed, written consent from the patient, and if a patient is a minor, from guardians.

The rule has an exemption for children experiencing precocious puberty, or puberty beginning before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys, as well as people who are intersex. In those cases, providers do not have to meet all the requirements before providing treatment.

The emergency rule states that gender-affirming care like puberty blockers or hormone replacement therapy is ""used in circumstances not supported by solid evidence,"" and because of that, it falls under the attorney general's purview of ""protecting consumers, including minors, from harm and investigating fraud and abuse in the state’s health care payment system."""
Mar 08 2023,Gov. Walz signs gender affirming healthcare bill - KVRR Local News,KVRR,center,https://kvrr.com/2023/03/08/gov-walz-signs-gender-affirming-healthcare-bill,"Gov. Walz signs gender affirming healthcare bill

ST. PAUL, Minn. (KVRR) — Governor Tim Walz signs an executive action to protect access to gender affirming healthcare in Minnesota.

It refers to all medical, surgical, counseling, or referral services, including telehealth services, that an individual may receive to support and affirm that individual’s gender identity or gender expression.

Walz says you will not be punished for seeking or providing medical care in Minnesota.

Walz says, “We’re going to be a place of refuge to make sure that they feel safe and welcome. And I don’t know what a group of people in Pierre who decided to make life miserable and more dangerous for people are thinking, but it’s not gonna happen in Minnesota.”

In February, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem signed a bill into law that will ban both surgical and non-surgical gender-affirming treatments for transgender minors."
Dec 12 2022,Biden Administration Approves Washington’s Plan To Subsidize Illegal Immigrants’ Healthcare,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2022/12/12/biden-administration-obamacare-section-1332-illegal-immigrants-healthcare/,"The Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Treasury approved a program Friday that will allow the state of Washington to use federal pass-through dollars to subsidize the healthcare of illegal immigrants.

The state’s Washington Healthplanfinder, created under Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act, will be subsidized by the federal government from 2024 – 2029, according to a notice of approval submitted to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. Section 1332 provides for state innovation waivers, which allow states to “to pursue innovative strategies for providing residents with access to high quality, affordable health insurance.” Washington is the second state to use the provision to fund healthcare for illegal immigrants, joining Colorado.

The Affordable Care Act restricts individuals who are not citizens or “alien[s] lawfully present in the United States” from buying subsidized health insurance through federal exchanges. However, Section 1332 state exchanges do not necessarily restrict such purchases, and are funded with federal pass-through dollars. The subsidies are technically compliant with federal law because the funds are not provided directly to the illegal immigrants.

“The state can then use pass-through funding for purposes of implementing its approved waiver plan. This includes using the pass-through funding to provide state subsidies to those not currently eligible for federal subsidies under the ACA, and to fund other state affordability programs,” a spokesperson for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within the HHS previously told the Daily Caller.

Washington argued in its waiver application that covering illegal immigrants would actually drive healthcare costs down, since “individuals without a federally recognized immigration status tend to have lower claims cost than lawfully present residents.”

“Prior research has shown that controlling for factors such as insurance status, spending among undocumented individuals is approximately 25% lower than among those who are lawfully present. Another study found that immigrants without proper documentation spent 50% to 60% less than U.S. born individuals per capita,” the filing ads.

During a 2020 presidential primary debate, several Democratic candidates declared their support for making government-funded healthcare available to illegal immigrants. Inslee, who did not participate in the debate, did not reveal his position on the issue during his failed campaign.

Washington estimated in its application that 479,800 of its residents do not have health insurance. A spokeswoman for the Washington State Health Care Authority told the Daily Caller that the state estimates 105,000 of those are illegal immigrants. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Republicans Propose Banning States From Funding Health Insurance For Illegal Immigrants)

“At a time when President Biden’s inflation crisis is already increasing the financial burdens on health care providers and families in Eastern Washington and across the nation, health care premiums and costs are rising substantially. Rather than using federal funds to mitigate some of these costs for health care providers and Washingtonians, Governor Inslee would rather spend it on undocumented immigrants,” Republican Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers said in a statement.

All three Republican members of Colorado’s congressional delegation introduced legislation in July prohibiting states from using pass-through money to subsidize health insurance for illegal immigrants. Republicans have long expressed concern about the issue, but Democrats denied as recently as 2021 that federal tax dollars could fund health insurance for illegal immigrants.

“Where the law as it stands now as I see it, it does not allow those who are unauthorized in this country to receive taxpayer-paid benefits except in very rare circumstances,” HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra testified at his confirmation hearings. “And it will be my job to make sure that we are following and enforcing the law.”"

PORTLAND, Ore. — A national cyberattack targeting the healthcare industry is impacting medical staff in Oregon. For almost a month, providers haven’t been able to collect insurance payments through a third-party, Change Healthcare.

The company pays out claims to doctors' offices and other service providers. Those claims make up a large portion of payments for many providers.

""Some businesses have to shut down temporarily in order to sort of save their business, basically,"" said Athena Phillips, the founder of Integrative Trauma Treatment Center.

Change Healthcare works with some of the biggest healthcare companies in the Portland metro area, such as Providence and Kaiser Permanente, a medical worker said.

Since many clinics or treatment centers are not receiving insurance payments, some medical workers may not be getting paid.

Workers at other centers told KGW that they are relying on savings in order to pay staff until the problem is fixed.

""It's really scary,"" Phillips said. “We basically cannot even submit our claims.”

Since Feb. 21, Phillips, like many medical workers around the country, haven’t received payments from Change Healthcare. Instead, she’s been forced to pay her staff through company savings.

""This is not something I could have foreseen,” Phillips said. “And I suspect there's going to be ripple effects that we can't anticipate.""

Others are facing similar issues.

""About 60% of our clients that we see every week are Medicaid funded,"" Megan Geary, the CEO of Cascade Counseling and Consulting, said.

Between 60% to 75% of patient payments are affected by the cyberattack. Geary is also turning to company savings to pay staff.

""We've also had to apply for a business line of credit so that we can make payroll,"" Geary said.

Along with Providence and Kaiser Permanente, Change Healthcare provides service for Care Oregon and the Oregon Health Plan, Geary said.

""Those are some big names,"" she added.

Pharmacies are also dealing with repercussions of the cyberattack. KGW spoke with a pharmacist who didn’t want to go on camera, but said they were temporarily unable to search for prescription insurance claims. The pharmacy also was unable to utilize copay cards, which drug manufacturers use to provide discounts on medication. Those problems have since been resolved.

In a press release, UnitedHealth Group, which owns Change Healthcare, said it is working to mitigate impact to consumers and care providers. They expect to re-establish connection to its insurance claims network by Monday.

Still, some aren’t convinced the problem will be fixed quickly.

""I'm not holding my breath,"" Geary said."
Mar 05 2024,"Salesforce CEO, wife donate $150M to Hawaii hospitals to bolster healthcare access",Hawaii News Now,center,https://hawaiinewsnow.com/2024/03/05/salesforce-ceo-wife-donates-150m-hawaii-hospitals-expand-healthcare-access,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Philanthropists Lynne and Marc Benioff have donated $150 million to two Hawaii hospitals in effort to help expand healthcare access across the islands.

That’s according to a joint statement issued Tuesday by Hilo Medical Center, Hawaii Pacific Health, UCSF Health and Salesforce.

Marc Benioff is the CEO of the software company Salesforce and he also owns TIME Magazine. His wife, Lynne Benioff, is the co-chair of TIME and is active on the boards of several organizations.

The donation is one of the largest single private philanthropic gifts in Hawaii’s history.

According to the press release, $50 million will go to Hilo Medical Center to build out critical areas of care, including a state-of-the-art family birthing center, intensive care unit, and neurosurgical program as well as behavioral health services.

In addition, $100 million will go to Hawaii Pacific Health to help create a “healthcare campus of the future” at Straub Medical Center in Honolulu.

The plan also includes connecting Hilo and Straub with UCSF Health in San Francisco to provide specialized care to patients.

This isn’t the first time the Benioff’s have donated to Hawaii’s healthcare and infrastructure sectors. Officials said in all, the Benioffs’ personal philanthropic giving totals more than $1 billion, including $600 million in healthcare donations in Hawaii, San Francisco and across the country.

“Our philosophy has always been to give locally and to give through experts who deeply understand local needs, and we are so pleased to have found that with the wonderful, lifesaving teams at Hilo Medical Center, Hawai’i Pacific Health and UCSF Health,” said the Benioff’s.

“We feel fortunate to have been part of the Hawai’i community for many decades and to be able to support our ohana in this way. Nothing is more important than the health of our community, and access to care for all who need it.”

In recognition of the Benioff’s longstanding contributions to Hawaii healthcare, officials said Hilo Medical Center will be renamed to “Hilo Benioff Medical Center” and the Straub Medical Center in Honolulu will become the “Straub Benioff Medical Center.”

According to a release from Nebraska Hospitals, Change Healthcare, a healthcare technology company in the U.S., faced a cyberattack on Wednesday, Feb.21, leading to disruptions in its systems and services.

The impact reverberated across a significant portion of Nebraska hospitals that rely on Change Healthcare for financial and clinical authorization services.

Jeremy Nordquist, President of the Nebraska Hospital Association (NHA), stated, ""The cyberattack on Change Healthcare is impacting the operations of most Nebraska hospitals. Our hospitals are doing their best to manage through these challenges as quickly and efficiently as possible.""

Hospital procedures such as prior authorizations for pharmaceuticals, procedures, and surgeries, insurance verification for inpatient stays, precise cost estimates for patients and patient billing have been affected by the cyberattack.

""Due to this incident, Nebraskans may experience longer wait times regarding authorizations for procedures, as well as delays in resolution of claims,"" Nordquist added. ""Our hospitals ask Nebraskans to be understanding as we work through these challenges.""

In response to the attack, the American Hospital Association (AHA) has been coordinating with the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

The AHA and NHA are urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assist hospitals and health systems in mitigating the repercussions of the recent cyberattack on Change Healthcare.

Updates will be posted as they become available.

Feb 27 2024,"Indiana bans healthcare for trans youth effective immediately, court rules",PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2024/02/28/indiana-bans-trans-healthcare,"The Seventh Court of Appeals has lifted an injunction blocking Indiana’s gender-affirming healthcare ban on 27 February, allowing the ban to take place immediately.

Senate Bill 480 prohibits medical providers from providing life-saving gender-affirmation treatment to individuals under 18 years of age. It also prohibits aiding or abetting another physician or practitioner in the provision of gender-affirming procedures to a minor.

The law was originally set to take effect on 1 July 2023, but a federal district court granted a request for a preliminary injunction against the bill in June 2023. A lawsuit was brought forward by four trans youths and their families, as well as a doctor and a healthcare clinic.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana has responded to the ban, calling it “beyond disappointing” for those in the LGBTQ+ community and their allies.

“This ruling is beyond disappointing and a heartbreaking development for thousands of transgender youth, their doctors, and their families,” the organisation said in a statement.

“As we and our clients consider our next steps, we want all the transgender youth of Indiana to know this fight is far from over and we will continue to challenge this law until it is permanently defeated and Indiana is made a safer place to raise every family.”

It comes after a Republican member who voted for the ban also introduced a bill allowing children to drop out of school and work full-time on farms.

State representative Joanna King introduced a bill on 8 January that would change child labour laws in the state to allow children to drop out of school after 8th grade (typically 14 to 15 years old) and work full-time on farms, LGBTQ Nation reported.

The bill would reportedly allow children to begin working 40 hours a week during school hours on both family and corporate farms, despite Human Rights Watch describing agriculture as the “deadliest work sector” for child workers in the US.

The introduced bill follows several recent attempts to relax child labour laws across the US, with a Florida Republican filing a bill to allow minors to work full-time and overnight in September 2023.

Civil rights attorney Alejandra Caraballo criticised the bill – which has not yet passed – while anti-LGBTQ+ laws continue to pass in the state.

“In DeSantis Florida, teens can work hazardous jobs full-time, but it’s illegal to teach them that LGBTQ+ people exist,” Caraballo said. “It’s not about protecting children.”"

""Right now our health care system is in critical need of help,"" said Sen. Dominick Ruggerio

The bills in a hefty health care package introduced at the state house cover everything from consumer protection and cost containment to provider availability and care quality.

Two of them offer incentives to address the primary care shortage in the state.





It's something the former Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health says is critical for the state.

""Primary care is the only medical service that's ever been shown to improve public health outcomes at the same time as it reduces cost so by not having enough we're in trouble,"" said Michael Fine.

One bill allocates over $3.5 million for a primary care scholarship program that would fund a four or two-year education for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician's assistants.

ALSO READ:

The students would then work in Rhode Island after school and residency for two years for every year they received the scholarship.

Fine says this is a step in the right direction.

""Many people graduate medical school with two or three or four or five hundred thousand dollars in debt so if you're going to get that much debt particularly if you don't have intergenerational wealth, you're going to choose a specialty that lets you pay off the debt quicker,"" Fine said.





Another bill would provide $2.7 million to primary care practices to enhance clinical training sites, increasing training slots by 50 percent.

""Since students often decide to work where they train increasing training can improve access to care,"" said Sen. Pamela Lauria.

On the financial side of the package, one bill would use American Rescue Plan Act funds to purchase medical debt, ultimately eliminating the debt for eligible Rhode Islanders.

""Those who have debt exceeding 5 percent of their income and individuals whose household income is below 400 percent of the federal poverty line,"" said Sen. Alana DiMario."
Feb 20 2024,Delaware lawmakers consider recommendations to protect state retirees' healthcare,ABC 47 WMDT,center,https://wmdt.com/2024/02/delaware-lawmakers-consider-recommendations-to-protect-state-retirees-healthcare,"Delaware lawmakers consider recommendations to protect state retirees’ healthcare

DOVER, Del. – The Delaware Retirees Healthcare Benefits Advisory Subcommittee presented its recommendations to lawmakers in a joint session this week on how to best protect health care for retired state workers.

The Delaware General Assembly created the subcommittee last year in response to concerns about retiree health care benefits. The goal was to come up with ways to address a growing unfunded liability when it comes to their health care and the health care of future retirees in the First State.

Lt. Governor Bethany Hall-Long, who chairs the committee, presented the findings to lawmakers Monday in a joint House and Senate Health Committee hearing. She tells us the recommendations, if implemented, would also protect Delaware’s future state retirees.

“We laid out a roadmap, a really clear roadmap, that’s going to protect and be sustainable for our current retirees, and yea, take into consideration the current employees and our future hires,” Lt. Governor Hall-Long explained.

The subcommittee met 20 times over the course of nine months and collected 10 hours of public testimony. Members reviewed other states’ Medicare supplemental coverage, individual marketplace, and Medicare plans, funding options, and actuarial and financial data.

The group’s report, published in December 2023, addressed several aspects of retiree healthcare, including strategies to address the Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Fund liability and recommended changes to the process by which the state selects state retiree healthcare plans.

The estimated liability for retiree health care benefits is currently $8.9 billion, of which $8.4 billion is unfunded. The net unfunded liability is expected to grow to $20.7 billion by 2042.

Subcommittee recommendations include:

The state should neither request nor consider a Medicare Advantage plan going forward.

Continue contributing 1% of general fund from the prior year to the OPEB fund.

Increase OPEB pre-funding from 0.36% of payroll to 0.5%, then increase by an additional 0.25% of payroll each fiscal year until it reaches 10%.

Ensure that current Medicare-eligible and pre-Medicare state retirees and state employees who retire prior to January 1, 2025 will be entitled to Special Medicfill/Rx benefits with no changes to the state share percentage of payments when they are Medicare eligible.

Limit changes to plan design, eligibility requirements, or contribution share/percentage to workers hired on or after January 1, 2025.

Solicit public comment before the SEBC holds a public vote to adopt the final request for proposal (RFP) for retiree healthcare plans.

Research and measure the cost of state-sponsored healthcare benefits for three subgroups: current workers, eligible pensioners who are ineligible for Medicare, and eligible pensioners who are eligible for Medicare.

Address the issue of healthcare pricing in Delaware, including statutory, regulatory, and administrative changes in 2024 to bring more transparency, consistency, affordability, and sustainability to healthcare prices and price growth.

The subcommittee also recommended modifying the state’s calculation for the portion of the state share for healthcare that the state pays for retirees. The percentage is based on the number of years of service for each retiree.

The subcommittee will continue to meet this year to further discuss the issue of retiree healthcare benefits and explore solutions."

Mar 02 2024,Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham Signs Landmark Bills To Improve Healthcare Affordability And Access For New Mexicans,Los Alamos Daily Post,center,https://ladailypost.com/gov-michelle-lujan-grisham-signs-landmark-bills-to-improve-healthcare-affordability-and-access-for-new-mexicans,"STATE News:

TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES — Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham Friday signed into law legislation that builds on the administration’s work to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for every New Mexican.

“Delivering quality healthcare to New Mexico’s population requires a tailored approach that takes into account rural communities, New Mexicans benefiting from Medicaid, and the tens of thousands of public employees in our state,” Gov. Lujan Grisham said. “These are bills that are going to positively impact a vast swath of New Mexicans.”

The governor signed these important healthcare bills during a ceremony at Sierra Vista Hospital in Truth or Consequences.

“The signing of this legislation brings immediate assistance to our community by helping us meet the needs of our residents and the thousands of New Mexicans who frequent Elephant Butte State Park and Lake annually,” Frank Cochran, CEO of Sierra Vista Hospital said. “Furthermore, the funds allocated through this legislation will stabilize our current operations and allow us to expand our much-needed behavioral health capacity, surgical services, and establish additional services.”

House Bill 7, Healthcare Affordability Fund, reduces insurance costs for small businesses, employees, and low- to moderate-income individuals through the state’s health insurance exchange program, beWellnm. Since its creation in 2021, the Health Care Affordability Fund programs have saved New Mexicans approximately $45 million on health insurance premiums, offering relief to over 6,000 small businesses and 41,000 employees. The bill maintains a 55% premium surtax distribution to the fund ensuring ongoing future support for the program. The bill is sponsored by Reps. Reena Szczepanski and Meredith Dixon and Sen. Siah Correa Hemphill.

“Since it was created in 2021, the Healthcare Affordability Fund has made our state healthier by helping tens of thousands of New Mexicans attain affordable health insurance,” said lead sponsor House Majority Whip Reena Szczepanski. “House Bill 7 will sustain the Healthcare Affordability Fund so that workers continue to get the coverage they need, small businesses can offer the benefits their employees deserve, and we can keep cutting New Mexico’s uninsured rate, which will reduce costs for everyone.”

Senate Bill 14, Health Care Authority, finalizes the establishment of a single unified department responsible for health care purchasing, oversight, and policy. The Health Care Authority will enhance coordination in the purchasing of health care for the state’s 180,000 public employees with a focus on improving plan design and affordability. The bill is sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Stefanics, Mimi Stewart, Michael Padilla and Peter Wirth.

“Every New Mexican deserves to have access to health care. Building off our efforts last year to establish the Health Care Authority, this measure will now help in streamlining the collaboration between the Department of Health and the Health Care Authority in the sharing of data, and ultimately improve health care access and affordability across the state,” Sen. Elizabeth Stefanics said.

Senate Bill 17, Health Care Delivery and Access Act, supports access to care in rural New Mexico by establishing a Medicaid Directed Payment Program. By leveraging hospital assessments, the program will generate $1.3 billion in federal funds for hospitals in the state. This landmark legislation supports long-term financial stability and access to hospitals statewide, ensuring continued healthcare services in rural New Mexico, where rural hospitals often struggle to stay above the bottom line. The bill is sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Stefanics, Michael Padilla and Martin Hickey and Reps. Doreen Gallegos and Jason Harper.

“Nearly a third of rural hospitals in New Mexico are at risk of closure due to financial challenges,” Sen. Stefanics said. “This new opportunity allowed in federal regulation to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals is a game-changer that will give New Mexico the resources we sorely need to provide better care in New Mexico. I want to thank Governor Lujan Grisham for her commitment to improving health care across the state but especially for her continued support for our rural communities.”

Senate Bill 161, Acute Care Facilities Subsidies, creates a temporary financial assistance grant program for independent rural hospitals until long-term support from SB 17 is enacted in early 2025. Recognizing the immediate challenges faced by these hospitals, the program aims to prevent any closures and further reductions in services. The bill is sponsored by Sens. George Muñoz and Pat Woods.

“Rural and regional hospitals are the heart of our communities and many of them are hanging on by a thread. Passing this measure and providing this funding is critical to their operations and will help ease some of the very real financial pressures they are facing, allowing them to stay open and prioritize the health and well-being of local residents,” Sen. George Muñoz said. “Thank you to Governor Lujan Grisham for signing this bill and looking out for our rural hospitals.”

The governor also signed the following health care bills on Friday:"
Feb 19 2024,Idaho asks Supreme Court to let gender-affirming healthcare ban stand,United Press International,center,https://upi.com/amp/Top_News/US/2024/02/20/Idaho-Supreme-Court-gender-affirming-healthcare-ban/7961708408100,"Feb. 20 (UPI) -- Idaho has asked the Supreme Court to allow the state to enforce its felony ban on minors receiving gender-affirming healthcare, stating the scope of the lower court's decision was too broad.

Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador filed the emergency motion Friday though it was only made public Monday.

Labrador said the Supreme Court should narrow the lower court's order as challengers only attacked certain parts of the law.

""The state has a duty to protect and support all children and that's why I'm proud to defend Idaho's law that ensures children are not subjected to these life-altering drugs and procedures,"" Labrador said in the Monday statement.

Idaho was among the first to criminalize the administration of gender-affirming healthcare for minors with up to 10 years' imprisonment when Gov. Brad Little signed House Bill 71 into law in April.

Little signed the law, which is also known as the Vulnerable Child Protection Act, amid a nationwide Republican effort to ban gender-affirming healthcare for minors despite every major medical association in the United States in support of adults and minors receiving such treatment.

The ban was challenged in July by two Idaho families with transgender children receiving medical care that would be prohibited under H.B. 71.

In late December, just days before the law was to go into effect on Jan. 1, a court ruled in the families' favor, stating the ban on hormones, puberty blockers and other medically supported practices violates the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Idaho appealed the ruling but lost. Late last month, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the state's motion to stay the district court's ruling without giving reason.

In the emergency ruling on Monday, Labrador and the Christian conservative Alliance Defending Freedom legal advocacy group asked the nation's highest court to allow the state to enforce the ban amid litigation except on the two teenagers whose families brought the original challenge.

""The state-wide universal injunction here concerns Idaho's Vulnerable Child Protection Act (VCPA), a statute regulating a list of medical procedures used to treat gender dysphoria in minors, and it goes far beyond any relief the Plaintiffs needed or had standing to seek,"" the state said in the filing.

""The Plaintiffs both want access to a single procedure, but the injunction applies to all 20+ procedures that the VCPA regulates. The Plaintiffs are two minors and their parents, and the injunction covers 2 million.""

The state argues that the scope of the injunction is too wide and infringes on its sovereignty to enforce its own laws.

According to the Movement Advancement Project, 22 states have banned gender-affirming healthcare for minors, including five that make it a felony."

Wyo4News staff, [email protected] [PRESS RELEASE]

January 4, 2023 — A permanent administrator has been named for the Wyoming State Hospital (WSH) in Evanston, while interim leadership is also planned for the Veterans’ Home of Wyoming (VHW) in Buffalo. Both facilities are operated by the Wyoming Department of Health (WDH).

Kristi Barker has been chosen to lead the WSH staff on a permanent basis. Barker took over as interim WSH administrator in October following the retirement of Paul Mullenax. Barker has a master’s degree in health administration and has been with WSH for 19 years in various roles, most recently working as WSH business manager before taking on the interim administrator role.

“Kristi’s knowledge of the hospital and her dedication to its mission are admirable. Her familiarity, dedication, and drive will serve Wyoming’s residents well in an ever-changing behavioral health system,” said Matt Petry, Behavioral Health Division senior administrator with WDH.

Stefan Johansson, WDH director, is also thanking Bruce Allison for his time leading the Veteran’s Home of Wyoming. Allison recently submitted his resignation as facility administrator, effective in early February. “Bruce led our staff in Buffalo during an important time of change as we constructed our new and recently opened skilled nursing community to expand the care we can offer to Wyoming’s veterans,” Johansson said.

Plans for interim and long-term VHW leadership are in the works. WSH, part of the WDH Behavioral Health Division, is Wyoming’s only state-operated psychiatric hospital and has been providing mental health services in Evanston for state residents since 1887.

Operating in Buffalo since 1903 to serve Wyoming veterans, VHW, part of the WDH Aging Division, offers domiciliary care, which is similar to assisted living care, as well as skilled nursing care, which is widely known as nursing home care."

Prior to the start of the new year, undocumented immigrants in California were able to receive only emergency aid and services related to pregnancy under the state's Medi-Cal program, California's version of Medicaid.

Undocumented children have been able to join Medi-Cal since 2015, and undocumented young adults between the ages of 19 and 25 have been able to join since 2019, and adults ages 50 and older have been able to receive full benefits since 2022.

Now, undocumented immigrants of all ages are eligible for the program provided they meet the income and residency requirements.

""In California, we believe everyone deserves access to quality, affordable healthcare coverage — regardless of income or immigration status,"" Newsom's office said in a statement to ABC. ""Through this expansion, we're making sure families and communities across California are healthier, stronger, and able to get the care they need when they need it.""

Republican state Sen. Roger Niello, who vice-chairs the Senate Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, criticized the move while the state faces a $68 billion budget deficit.

""Regardless of what your position is on this, it doesn't make sense for us to be adding to our deficit,"" Niello said in a statement to the The Associated Press."

Veteran rappers Fat Joe, who has spearheaded music’s awareness of the organization, and Chuck D will also be in attendance.

“When we were asked by Power to the Patients to help raise awareness of the need for transparency in healthcare pricing, we immediately said yes. People suffering from illness and injury shouldn’t have to worry about being bankrupted by surprise charges for their treatment,” Foo Fighters said in a collective statement.

With lawmakers, government officials, and their dedicated staff in attendance, the group is aiming to raise awareness about the inequality and uncertainty created for millions of patients when hospitals and insurers hide actual upfront prices. More than 100 million Americans are suffering from medical debt due to surprise bills and lack of accountability.

Power to the Patients is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to creating a more affordable and equitable healthcare system through price transparency. For years, hospitals and insurers have been disregarding rules requiring them to disclose prices to patients in advance of care. For more information, visit, PowertothePatients.org.

In promoting the organization, Foo Fighters join such artists as Fat Joe, Jelly Roll, Wyclef Jean, French Montana, Rick Ross, Busta Rhymes, Chuck D, Method Man, Lainey Wilson, Valerie June, Shepard Fairey, and rock band Everclear. Fat Joe has taken the message to Capitol Hill, visiting with members of the U.S. House and Senate and urging them to pass legislation to codify and expand healthcare price transparency requirements.

New polling shows 94% of Americans support healthcare price transparency, yet only 36% of hospitals comply with rules requiring them to disclose prices, according to the announcement. In December of last year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill to strengthen and expand healthcare price transparency requirements, hold hospitals and insurers accountable, and stand up for patients, workers, employers, unions, and all healthcare consumers.

Jan 30 2024,Texas Supreme Court to decide on controversial healthcare ban for trans minors,CBS Austin KEYE,center,https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/texas-supreme-court-to-decide-on-controversial-healthcare-ban-for-trans-minors,"The fate of one of the most polarizing laws passed by the Texas legislature in 2023 could be in the hands of the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court, which for trans minors on Tuesday.

, authored by Republican Senator Donna Campbell, was signed into law last year, set to take effect in September. Before that, several families and advocates sued the state, and a Travis County judge granted a temporary injunction against the policy, which is before the state Supreme Court.



There's no set date on when an opinion should come from the court, though it likely will come before the Supreme Court's session ends in August.

One of the primary arguments at hand between the two parties had to do with whether or not the Texas legislature was within its rights to, effectively, supersede the rights of parents to regulate the medical industry.

""It is critically important that every parent has rights and protections under our Texas Constitution, to make medical decisions that will be safe and effective for their children,"" Paul Castillo, Senior Counsel at Lambda Legal, said. ""We cannot live in the state of Texas and have Texas constitutional rights being usurped by the state of Texas that is guaranteed to every other parent that is guaranteed to doctors to follow the science to follow the provision of care that is proven to be safe, effective and medically necessary.""

The Office of the Attorney General argued in court that enacting such legislation would do lasting damage to Texas minors, despite both the wishes of parents and the largely-affirming stance of medical bodies on trans healthcare for youths.

""People have spoken, elected officials have spoken and stood firm on these issues,"" Jonathan Saenz, President of Texas Values, a conservative organization, said. ""The more that we stand firm, we're starting to find out more about actually what the details are, and what the facts are about these issues. And the more that we peel those layers, we're finding that kids are getting harmed and they're crying for help.""

The Office of the Attorney General requested that the Supreme Court, in its opinion, decide once and for all whether or not SB 14 is constitutional. The attorneys suing the state asked the court to send the case back to lower courts for a full trial.



SB 14 has long been one of the most divisive policies out of the 88th legislative session, drawing fierce demonstration in the Texas Capitol. At one event, more than 100 LGBTQ demonstrators were expelled from the Capitol after demonstrating in the House chamber.

The People’s Republic of California will soon be offering lawless illegal aliens healthcare, courtesy of the state’s taxpayers.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom loves nothing more than tyrannizing American citizens and rewarding criminals - naturally, since he’s a Democrat.

The latest news from the land of fruits and nuts is that illegal aliens there will, as of Jan. 1, 2024, have access to “free” healthcare.

In other words, citizens will be forced to pay for non-citizens to receive healthcare in a country where they shouldn’t be in the first place.

Western Journal reported on Dec. 30:

In 2015, the state legislature allowed for children to be entered into Medi-Cal. Then in 2019, Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law allowing illegals up to ages 25 to gain access to Medi-Cal. On the heels of that expansion, Medi-Cal was then opened up to illegals aged 50 and up. According to California Democrat State Sen. María Elena Durazo, the expansion set to go into effect on Monday will allow the remainder of the illegal alien population, an additional 700,000 illegals, to enter Medi-Cal.

Mind you, California doesn’t even have the money to pay for its current programs, let alone 700,000 more illegal aliens’ healthcare.

Earlier in December, it was reported that the state of California faces a $68 billion deficit. How on earth is Democrat government spending sustainable?

Durazo made the outrageous claim that healthcare is a “human right,” a claim which would have astounded the Founding Fathers.

“This historic investment speaks to California’s commitment to health care as a human right,” Durazo pontificated.

Except that healthcare as a right implies that someone is obligated to provide you his labor, regardless of compensation or choice, which is the definition of slavery.

Western Journal noted that Gov. Newsom is very proud of the legislation.

“In California, we believe everyone deserves access to quality, affordable health care coverage — regardless of income or immigration status,” Newsom’s office said in comments to ABC News. “Through this expansion, we’re making sure families and communities across California are healthier, stronger, and able to get the care they need when they need it.”

This from the governor who forced the injurious COVID-19 vaccines on Californians of all ages, regardless of evidence that they did not protect people from COVID-19.

Ultimately, this isn’t about compassion and ensuring high quality healthcare for residents of California. It’s about destroying society as we know it, undermining the Constitution, and erasing the concept of nations with distinct borders.

That’s really the goal of the Democrats, including Gov. Hair-Do Newsom and the other leftists running California into the ground."

Jan 25 2024,"What’s next for Ohio’s trans athlete, healthcare bill after Statehouse override",NBC 4 WCMH,center,https://nbc4i.com/news/politics/whats-next-for-ohios-trans-athlete-healthcare-bill-after-statehouse-override,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — A new law for transgender athletes and minors seeking gender-affirming care will be enacted in a few months after state lawmakers overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of House Bill 68.

“We’re really let down,” said Maria Bruno, Equality Ohio Public Policy Director. “We had conversations that left us with some hope that [Republican lawmakers] were listening to doctors and hospitals and people who receive gender affirming care. Their political ambitions are more important than kids’ lives.”

“There is a line, that the state legislature and sometimes executive authority, has to draw on protection of children,” said Senate President Matt Huffman (R-Lima).

While H.B. 68’s effective date is in less than three months, Bruno said this is not where things end.

“The fight is absolutely not over,” she said. “Several legal options are being explored and I’m sure you’ll hear more about that when the time is right.”

“I do think it will pass constitutional scrutiny,” Huffman said.

When DeWine vetoed the bill, he also enacted emergency rules and is working on more in the area of gender-affirming care; now, there will be two sets of laws on the books come April 24.

“It’s definitely very confusing,” Bruno said.

“When there’s overlap and action on two different things, there’s confusion,” Huffman said.

H.B. 68 bans trans athletes from participating on teams that align with their gender identity and bans minors from receiving gender-affirming care. DeWine’s executive order that is currently active bans gender transition surgeries for minors. Now, he is working on rules to require mental health counseling before adults seek gender-affirming care.

“The whole goal candidly, was pretty simple, and that was to make sure that before anyone actually starts on medication that they have some counseling,” DeWine said. “It’s abundantly clear that good medical practice, at the start, needs to include counseling.”

“It’s much more expansive than even what House Bill 68 addressed because it goes into regulated adult care,” Bruno said. “They might not be making things illegal but they’re going to make things so logistically difficult to be able to actually provide services that they functionally have shut down the care.”

DeWine said what his office has drafted is not set in stone, and noted he has received an “unprecedented” number of comments about the rules.

“You are going to see some revisions of this that we put forward fairly quickly,” DeWine said.

In the meantime, Bruno said she has spoken to several trans adults who are worried that they may have to leave the state, depending on what DeWine enacts.

“if they could no longer receive medical care in the state, I do think you would see many transgender people forced to leave the state,” Bruno said.

“We don’t want to interfere with people, but we want to make sure that good medical practice is followed,” DeWine said."

The Canadian government will limit the number of foreign students attending their universities for two years in order to ease pressure on the country's housing and healthcare.

The Ministry of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship announced the decision Monday as an initiative ostensibly aimed at benefiting the foreign student community.

""In recent years, the integrity of the international student system has been threatened,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""Some institutions have significantly increased their intakes to drive revenues, and more students have been arriving in Canada without the proper supports they need to succeed.""

CANADIAN POLICE WARN THAT POSTING VIDEOS OF ALLEGED PACKAGE THIEVES COULD BE 'VIOLATION' OF THEIR PRIVACY

The ministry continued, ""Rapid increases in the number of international students arriving in Canada also puts pressure on housing, health care and other services.""

The two-year cap, which will start this year, will limit undergraduate study permits to approximately 360,000 individuals.

""In the spirit of fairness, individual provincial and territorial caps have been established, weighted by population, which will result in much more significant decreases in provinces where the international student population has seen the most unsustainable growth,"" the ministry said regarding the cap.

The government assured current students that permit renewals will not be affected by the new policy.

""In the coming weeks, we will no longer issue work permits to spouses of international students, apart from those in masters and doctoral programs,"" Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marc Miller said on X.

The ministry is hoping to exclude professional programs in areas such as law and medicine from the cap.

""International students enrich our communities - but we have an obligation to ensure that they have access to the resources they need to succeed in Canada,"" Miller concluded. ""We will continue to implement reforms to ensure the integrity of the program and uphold the academic experience in Canada.""

The student cap marks only the latest attempt by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to grapple with skyrocketing housing prices across the country."
Jan 16 2024,Activists Win a Battle for Women’s Reproductive Healthcare in a Rural Colorado Town,The Daily Yonder,center,https://dailyyonder.com/activists-win-a-battle-for-womens-reproductive-healthcare-in-a-rural-colorado-town/2024/01/16/,"On June 8, 2023, Lindsay Yeager of Cortez, Colorado, woke up to a barrage of text messages, asking if she had heard about the local birthing center closing. Yeager immediately sprang into action. By that evening, protesters gathered across the street from the city’s hospital with placards and a purpose: keeping the birthing center open.

The strategy worked, at least for the time being. About 10 days later, on the eve of another planned protest, Southwest Health System, which operates Southwest Memorial Hospital in Cortez, announced in a press release that the birthing center would remain open “following stakeholder input over the past two weeks.”

Yeager posted in a Facebook group that evening: “Congratulations Montezuma County! We will not be protesting tonight…Our fight is not over. We’ll be taking a breath to regroup but the battle for stable, community-focused care in Montezuma County continues!”

In Colorado, there are two types of facilities where someone can give birth: a hospital or a birth center. A birth center is a freestanding facility, separate from a hospital in every way. In this story, when using the terminology birthing center, we are referring to the labor and delivery unit at SW Medical Center hospital, or other hospital associated maternal care units, not a free standing birth center

Judging by national trends, Yeager is likely correct that the battle will continue. Across the U.S., under half of rural hospitals like Southwest Memorial provide maternal-care services, and the number is falling, as the Daily Yonder has reported. The cost of maternal services is the primary cause of closures, according to the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

In a press release announcing the closure of the birthing center, SW Health named several factors that have affected rural maternal care programs, including cuts in reimbursements, difficulty recruiting specialists, declining birthing volume, and an aging population. The press release said these are general problems in rural areas but did not link them expressly to the decision to close the Cortez birthing center.

In December, Southwest Health CEO Joe Theine, said finances are difficult for the maternity program. He said the costs per discharge in labor and delivery have gone up from $3,000 in 2019 to $4,500 in 2022. According to data from the Colorado Department of Public Health, 206 babies were born in a hospital in Montezuma County in 2022. SW Health runs the only hospital in Montezuma County.

Nationwide, less than half of all rural hospitals like SW Health offer maternal services, and the number is dropping, the Daily Yonder has reported. So Cortez has bucked the trend, for now. But the hospital’s long-term ability to provide services like the birthing center depends on community support, said Joe Theine, SW Health CEO.

In meeting minutes from an emergency board meeting on June 15 that was called in response to the birthing center protest, it was stated that SW Health was losing over $1 million annually.

“Birth is not profitable, that is not where healthcare institutions make money,” Yeagers said.

Over 50% of Montezuma County’s hospital births in 2022 were covered by Medicaid.

Southwest Health System is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation and is managed by Community Hospital Consulting, which is owned by Community Hospital Corporation, based in Plano, Texas. CHC assumed management in 2018 when the hospital nearly went bankrupt. The CHC website describes SW Health System as a “turnaround story.”

In addition to the Southwest Health System board, the hospital’s building and facilities are governed by the Montezuma County Hospital District board.

Yeager said losing maternal care services can have a ripple effect in a rural area. “I knew that not having the birthing center was going to have this domino effect,” she said. “It was going to affect women’s health care in all facets. It wasn’t just going to be that you wouldn’t be able to deliver a baby there.”

According to a March of Dimes 2022 maternal care deserts report, women in rural areas are at higher risk for childbirth complications and rural hospitals report higher rates of hemorrhage and blood transfusions as compared to urban hospitals. Half the women in rural areas have to travel farther than 30 miles to reach an obstetrics hospital, according to the study.

Without the birthing center, Cortez would be in that group. The next closest birthing center is in Durango, 45 miles east. Durango’s hospital, Mercy Regional Medical Center, is a Catholic affiliate hospital and does not provide tubal ligation or any medical procedures that could be associated with abortion.

The Cortez birthing center also serves southeast Utah or northwest New Mexico.

The closest big cities are Albuquerque (a four-hour drive) and Salt Lake City (a 5.5-hour drive). Denver is about seven hours and many mountain passes away by road.

A Community-Led Effort

Southwest Health’s initial announcement said the birthing center closure was temporary, while the hospital worked “to develop a plan that would allow us to resume these services.” But Yeager said once she started researching, she found no cases of a birthing center closing temporarily and successfully reopening.

So she decided to help Cortez (population 9,117) come together to urge the hospital to keep the birthing center open.

The initial protest consisted of community members holding signs with slogans such as “Our Community, Our Hospital” and “Care close to home, just not for mothers and babies” across the street from the hospital.

After that, Yeager and a group of organizers started releasing the names and email addresses of board members and decision-makers for the hospital, and the community began to send a stream of messages opposing the birthing center’s closure. Residents connected via a Facebook group titled “Keep Our Birthing Center & Women’s Services Open,” sharing resources and planning protests.

The group’s first request was for the hospital to hold a public meeting to hear community concerns. SW Health responded with an emergency board meeting on June 15, 2023.

“It was so powerful because it was such a united voice from the community…there was just no way to deny what the community wanted,” Yeager said. She said the birthing center issue drew the community together and attracted support across political boundaries.

Hospital CEO Theine said in December that it’s up to the community to continue to support the hospital and all its services. The hospital’s costs are fixed, while the revenue fluctuates based on the number of people coming in the door. If the hospital provides it, and the community comes, they can provide more services, said Theine, “We exist to serve the community.”

Looking for Alternatives

The lack of maternity services in rural areas has some people looking for alternatives. Elephant Circle is a Colorado-based non-profit dedicated to “birth justice,” a term that includes everything from reproductive health advocacy to finding creative solutions for rural maternal care.

“Birth started in communities. It was upheld by community midwives from the beginning of time,” said Heather Thompson, deputy director of Elephant Circle. “And then the medical industrial complex eliminated midwifery and moved birth from the community into these for-profit institutions. (SW Health is a nonprofit. Ed.) And now we’re seeing some of the outcomes, those systems were not built for Black or Indigenous people. Those systems were not built to thrive in poor monetary resource places.”

Thompson advocates a more community-centered approach to birth through birth centers and midwives, although one issue with this is insurance. Medicaid does not reimburse Certified Professional Midwives (CPM), which is the only midwife certification where practitioners are required to have experience birthing babies in an out-of-hospital setting. CPMs are often only treating women with the means to afford a midwife, due to lack of insurance reimbursement, “which is not actually the populations that we’re worried about,” said Thompson.

Yeager said she worries about transportation issues if there isn’t a birthing option in Montezuma County.

“Over the course of a pregnancy, a woman may have 15 prenatal appointments or more,” Yeager said. “So if there’s a higher risk and if you don’t have a car or you don’t have gas, how many of those appointments are you going to miss? And how much does missing each appointment raise your risk level of complication?”

For now, the birthing center in Cortez remains open.

Yeager said the work to keep the center open is worth it.

“Every baby that’s been born there, every mom that’s received care there, every woman that’s been able to get care there since the date of that potential closure was worth fighting for,” Yeager said.

UPDATE: The previous version of this story didn’t specify the difference between “birthing center” and “birth center” specific to Colorado. We have added a paragraph distinguishing between the two types of facilities.

Jan 03 2024,Increasing need for mental healthcare driving Avera Behavioral Health expansion,Dakota News Now,center,https://dakotanewsnow.com/2024/01/04/increasing-need-mental-healthcare-driving-avera-behavioral-health-expansion,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - Avera announced on Wednesday that it is planning to expand its behavioral health program in two South Dakota cities, saying it’s needed now because of increasing demand among those who feel they need some assistance in managing their mental health.

Avera first started noticing the increasing need for mental healthcare a couple of years ago, coinciding with the pandemic.

“We’ve continued to see growing volumes in mental health in both Aberdeen and in Sioux Falls,” said Avera Behavioral Health Vice President, Thomas Otten.

Otten said their expansion efforts are building an entirely new mental health facility in Aberdeen with 18 beds. In Sioux Falls, they will complete construction on an already existing space.

“We will have a 16-bed unit dedicated to our most chronically mentally ill patients,” Otten said.

A serious plan to meet a serious need.

In recent years, a little more than 6,000 people have been moving to Sioux Falls every year. Whether that trend continues, we don’t know. What we do know is that an increase means more people living with mental health issues who want to seek help.

“We know Sioux Falls is growing so we want to be able to keep up and never have the problem of turning people away,” said Dr. David Ermer, the Clinical Vic President of the Avera Behavioral Health Service Line.

Ermer is pleased the health system is making this effort to stay ahead of the mental health curve.

But none of this is free. More than $7 million will be invested between the two locations, the result of federal and state funding and private donations, including $1.5 million from Dacotah Bank.

“We couldn’t do this without the state, the federal level and the individual donors,” Ermer said.

While the specific program improvements are happening in two of South Dakota’s largest cities, the result of this plan will spread far beyond those city boundaries.

“It’s not just Aberdeen and Sioux Falls,” Ermer said. “We cover a large rural footprint and so this is going to benefit a huge area.”

Nov 27 2023,Masterson Place receives Healthcare Hospitality Network certification,Oil City News,center,https://oilcity.news/community/health/2023/11/27/masterson-place-receives-healthcare-hospitality-network-certification,"CASPER, Wyo. — Casper’s nonprofit healthcare hospitality home was recently recognized as a Certified Hospitality House by the Healthcare Hospitality Network, or HHN.

According to a release from Masterson Place, the certification was given to the facility in recognition of its training and practice standards.

“Masterson Place, which is owned by Natrona Collective Health Trust, originally opened in 2001, and has been operating in its current location at 310 S. Washington St. since 2019,” the release said. “Its mission is to provide a safe and clean home away from home for loved ones of patients receiving medical care in Casper.”

The facility offers 14 guest rooms at $50 per night to alleviate financial pressures faced by people traveling to Casper for medical issues.

The certification was issued after employees completed hundreds of hours of online training in addition to a national conference in Baltimore.

“We are so proud to be a part of Masterson Place and what it represents,” said Mike Romero, Masterson Place manager, in the release. “Our focus on giving our guests the best experience motivates us to keep learning. Having Masterson Place recognized on a national level is the highlight to the many hours of training and education we’ve taken.”

Membership to HHN and the conference opportunity were made possible thanks to the generosity of the Masterson Family Foundation, the release said."
Nov 20 2023,North Dakota rural healthcare center is the heartbeat of the community,Inforum,center,https://inforum.com/health/north-dakota-rural-healthcare-center-is-the-heartbeat-of-the-community,"COOPERSTOWN, N.D. — Dakota Regional Medical Center is a vital part of the rural communities that it serves.

The Cooperstown-based healthcare organization in east-central North Dakota provides medical services in a state-of-the-art hospital, clinic and long-term care center.

“Access to health care services is one of the issues we face in rural health, so for people to have a state of the art hospital and clinic system in their community or within their driving distance area is really important,” said Brad Gibbens, Center for Rural Health acting director in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Rural health Staying healthy in rural areas can come with special challenges. Our November Agweek Special Report looks at all facets of health and health care in rural parts of our region.

“It is a good investment on the part of the hospital and the community to have a new physical plant,” he said, noting that the coronavirus pandemic illustrated the need for features such as no-touch door opening systems and cleaning systems that can eradicate viruses.

Meanwhile, health care organizations like Dakota Regional Medical Center do not only provide hospital care, but also include a medical clinic and long-term care, Gibbens said.

Construction on Dakota Regional Medical Center began in June 2021 and was completed in June 2023.

The former hospital had for several years struggled financially and was in an aging building when the board and staff members, with the support of the Cooperstown community, made the decision to build a new healthcare center.

“A lot of changes had to happen surrounding all those difficult decisions. We had some changes in staff, some changes in leadership, and things just came together, and we’re very fortunate to be here … to be where we’re at today is pretty amazing,” said Nikki Lindsey, Dakota Regional Medical Center CEO.

”Pretty outstanding groups of individuals came together to make sure that we were not only here for five years, but for many years into the future,” Lindsey said.

Formerly called Cooperstown Medical Center in June 2023, the board selected the new name that would more accurately reflect the broad region the facility serves. The medical center operates satellite clinics in New Rockford, North Dakota and Lakota, North Dakota.

Dakota Regional Medical Center serves patients in Steele, Barnes and Foster counties, besides Eddy County, where New Rockford is located and Nelson County, where Lakota is located.

Other healthcare options for Cooperstown were limited, with the nearest North Dakota hospitals, Mayville, Carrington and Valley City, being about 45 miles away, and 80 miles to Devils Lake. That underscores how essential it is to operate a hospital in the community, said Don Vigesaa, who headed the fundraising campaign for the center’s new hospital.

“We’re right in that spot where there needs to be a medical community,” said Vigesaa, a retired Cooperstown car dealership owner.

Dakota Regional Medical Center provides healthcare, including 24-hour emergency services, rehabilitation services and a medical clinic that is open for appointments six days a week. It also has a long-term care facility attached to it.

The medical center also provides outpatient services, such as physical therapy, and is developing pulmonary rehabilitation services. It will begin offering obstetrics care within the next few months and is working on a plan to offer cardiology services.

Dakota Regional Medical Center has 45 healthcare staff and support staff members and about 80 staff members work in the Griggs County Care Center.

It’s critical for patients to have access to good healthcare in the communities in which they live, especially when rapid response to major medical events, such as strokes, heart attacks and traumas is critical to positive outcomes, said Steven Barlow, Dakota Regional Medical Center family nurse practitioner.

Studies show that the outcomes are poorer in rural communities because patients don’t have access to care, he said.

“Minutes matter. Having a place that can care for you, even if it’s to stabilize you and get you to your next phase of your care, is essential,” Barlow said. Besides that, rural health care providers do a superior job of having a holistic approach to their patients’ healthcare, Barlow believes.

“We get to know them, we get to know their families, and then, we can help shape their healthcare plans in conjunction with them, truly a collaboration with them.

‘What are their values and goals? Are we at a point where maximum function is important or are we transitioning from that to where comfort is a goal?” Barlow asked.

In June 2023, Dakota Regional Medical Center opened its new hospital and clinic on the south side of Cooperstown, several blocks from the old hospital built in the 1950s for a cost of $500,000.

Cooperstown community members appreciate having ready access to care at Dakota Regional Medical Center, said Amber Wogsland, Cooperstown Medical Center Foundation director, recalling a compliment that the center recently received from a parent who had brought his ill child to the center’s emergency room.

Holly Luna, Dakota Regional Medical Center chief nursing officer, is selecting photos sthat will decorate the walls of the hospital, clinic and care center. Many of the photos, which were submitted by community members, are of farm fields, farm animals and the surrounding rural landscape Ann Bailey / Agweek

The parent was able to get the child to be examined by a Dakota Regional Medical Center provider, get a diagnosis and a prescription, which was filled at the local pharmacy, all within a short time and get back to his workplace where he was a manager in charge of a number of workers.

The parent told Wogsland that if he had to travel to a larger healthcare facility “it would have been an all day ordeal.”

The new $27 million Dakota Regional Medical Center and Griggs County Care Center were built primarily with funding from a U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development 40-year loan and a $2.5 million fundraising campaign led by a five-member committee headed by Vigesaa.

“The community was very supportive,” said Vigesaa. Community residents and former residents donated to the fundraising campaign, which raised $2.75 million, exceeding the goal by $250,000.

Though the fundraising campaign exceeded its goal, Vigesaa hopes to raise more funds.

“I’d like to hit $3 million,” he said.

The additional funding would be used to expand space to add services such as colonoscopy, dialysis and cardiac rehabilitation.

Besides the 45 healthcare providers and support staff who work in the clinic and hospital, 80 employees work in the attached 40-bed Griggs County Care Center.

The majority of Dakota Regional Medical Center’s executive team and staff live on nearby farms and rural communities. Barlow believes that one of the reasons that the center recruits and maintains staff is because they have an opportunity for advancement.

Lindsey, for example, began her career at the center in 1997 the day after she graduated with a nursing degree from Jamestown (North Dakota College). Her original plan was to work at then-Cooperstown Medical Center for three years, then move to a larger city and get a job in the hospital there as an obstetrics nurse.

By the time three years had passed, she no longer wanted to leave the small-town hospital.

“Rural people take care of their people, and I just didn’t have the desire to go where patients are a number. I had more desire to take care of people and get to know their name and their family,” Lindsey said.

During the past 27 years, her career advanced from registered nurse, to director of nursing, to Dakota Medical Center CEO.

“All of my family lives here. We’re five minutes from our jobs,” Johnson said.

Meanwhile, Hannah Zaun, who began working at the center as a “casual nurse” — one who is not regularly scheduled and can decide whether or not to work — moved to a full-time nurse, then director of nursing and now, chief nursing officer.

“That’s the key to success for this facility,” Barlow said. “There’s just so much opportunity.""

The satisfaction that Dakota Regional Medical Center staff have with their jobs and their camaraderie benefits their patients, he said.

“When you have an entire group of people that are all on the same page and know where they want to move in the future means there’s more consistency of care,” Barlow said.

“It is a beautiful thing to work in rural health and I wouldn’t do it anywhere else,” he said."

Other healthcare options for Cooperstown were limited, with the nearest North Dakota hospitals, Mayville, Carrington and Valley City, being about 45 miles away, and 80 miles to Devils Lake. That underscores how essential it is to operate a hospital in the community, said Don Vigesaa, who headed the fundraising campaign for the center’s new hospital.

“We’re right in that spot where there needs to be a medical community,” said Vigesaa, a retired Cooperstown car dealership owner.

Dakota Regional Medical Center provides healthcare, including 24-hour emergency services, rehabilitation services and a medical clinic that is open for appointments six days a week. It also has a long-term care facility attached to it.

The medical center also provides outpatient services, such as physical therapy, and is developing pulmonary rehabilitation services. It will begin offering obstetrics care within the next few months and is working on a plan to offer cardiology services.

Dakota Regional Medical Center has 45 healthcare staff and support staff members and about 80 staff members work in the Griggs County Care Center.

It’s critical for patients to have access to good healthcare in the communities in which they live, especially when rapid response to major medical events, such as strokes, heart attacks and traumas is critical to positive outcomes, said Steven Barlow, Dakota Regional Medical Center family nurse practitioner.

Studies show that the outcomes are poorer in rural communities because patients don’t have access to care, he said.

“Minutes matter. Having a place that can care for you, even if it’s to stabilize you and get you to your next phase of your care, is essential,” Barlow said. Besides that, rural health care providers do a superior job of having a holistic approach to their patients’ healthcare, Barlow believes.

“We get to know them, we get to know their families, and then, we can help shape their healthcare plans in conjunction with them, truly a collaboration with them.

‘What are their values and goals? Are we at a point where maximum function is important or are we transitioning from that to where comfort is a goal?” Barlow asked.

In June 2023, Dakota Regional Medical Center opened its new hospital and clinic on the south side of Cooperstown, several blocks from the old hospital built in the 1950s for a cost of $500,000.

Cooperstown community members appreciate having ready access to care at Dakota Regional Medical Center, said Amber Wogsland, Cooperstown Medical Center Foundation director, recalling a compliment that the center recently received from a parent who had brought his ill child to the center’s emergency room.

Many of the photos, which were submitted by community members, are of farm fields, farm animals and the surrounding rural landscape Ann Bailey / Agweek

The parent was able to get the child to be examined by a Dakota Regional Medical Center provider, get a diagnosis and a prescription, which was filled at the local pharmacy, all within a short time and get back to his workplace where he was a manager in charge of a number of workers.

The parent told Wogsland that if he had to travel to a larger healthcare facility “it would have been an all day ordeal.”

The new $27 million Dakota Regional Medical Center and Griggs County Care Center were built primarily with funding from a U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development 40-year loan and a $2.5 million fundraising campaign led by a five-member committee headed by Vigesaa.

“The community was very supportive,” said Vigesaa. Community residents and former residents donated to the fundraising campaign, which raised $2.75 million, exceeding the goal by $250,000.

Though the fundraising campaign exceeded its goal, Vigesaa hopes to raise more funds.

“I’d like to hit $3 million,” he said.

The additional funding would be used to expand space to add services such as colonoscopy, dialysis and cardiac rehabilitation.

Besides the 45 healthcare providers and support staff who work in the clinic and hospital, 80 employees work in the attached 40-bed Griggs County Care Center.

The majority of Dakota Regional Medical Center’s executive team and staff live on nearby farms and rural communities. Barlow believes that one of the reasons that the center recruits and maintains staff is because they have an opportunity for advancement.

Lindsey, for example, began her career at the center in 1997 the day after she graduated with a nursing degree from Jamestown (North Dakota College). Her original plan was to work at then-Cooperstown Medical Center for three years, then move to a larger city and get a job in the hospital there as an obstetrics nurse.

By the time three years had passed, she no longer wanted to leave the small-town hospital.

“Rural people take care of their people, and I just didn’t have the desire to go where patients are a number. I had more desire to take care of people and get to know their name and their family,” Lindsey said.

During the past 27 years, her career advanced from registered nurse, to director of nursing, to Dakota Medical Center CEO.

Makenzie Johnson moved back home to a farm near Cooperstown from Bismarck with her husband to accept a job as radiology manager.

“All of my family lives here. We’re five minutes from our jobs,” Johnson said.

Meanwhile, Hannah Zaun, who began working at the center as a “casual nurse” — one who is not regularly scheduled and can decide whether or not to work — moved to a full-time nurse, then director of nursing and now, chief nursing officer.

“That’s the key to success for this facility,” Barlow said. “There’s just so much opportunity.""

The satisfaction that Dakota Regional Medical Center staff have with their jobs and their camaraderie benefits their patients, he said.

“When you have an entire group of people that are all on the same page and know where they want to move in the future means there’s more consistency of care,” Barlow said.

“It is a beautiful thing to work in rural health and I wouldn’t do it anywhere else,” he said."
Jan 03 2024,"LG says entrepreneurship, renewable energy, healthcare will blossom from West Virginia presence",WV Metro News,center,https://wvmetronews.com/2024/01/03/lg-says-entrepreneurship-renewable-energy-healthcare-will-blossom-from-west-virginia-presence,"West Virginia officials today welcomed an investment by LG, the international tech and electronics powerhouse.

The investment is described as a strategic initiative to grow new business ventures in West Virginia and advance the development of technologies for renewable energy, healthcare, and industries of the future.

Gov. Jim Justice made the announcement along with other state and federal officials during a Wednesday afternoon gathering at the state Culture Center. Officials who made remarks included senators Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican, along with state Senate President Craig Blair and House Speaker Roger Hanshaw.

Earlier in the day, the state Department of Economic Development voted in favor of a resolution to support the LG project with $54 million.

As a part of the collaboration with the Economic Development department, LG NOVA plans to establish branch offices in Huntington, home of Marshall University, and Morgantown, home of West Virginia University.

LG is a multinational company making electronics, chemicals, household appliances and telecommunications products.

“First of all, we should be very, very appreciative. And grateful. I mean, LG could go anywhere. I mean, that’s always true. I mean, they’ve got the money. They’ve got the intelligence they can go anywhere on the globe,” Justice said.

Officials estimate 275 high-skilled jobs will result from the businesses, created by LG NOVA, LG Electronics’ North America Innovation Center.

The company says LG NOVA’s mission is to build, nurture, and grow innovations that affect the future.

“LG is on a continual growth path to bring new value to its customers and partners; and build transformational businesses. We’re thankful for leaders like Governor Justice and his team for welcoming us to West Virginia as true collaboration partners,” said LG Electronics Global CEO William Cho.

“LG is committed to building a better future, and through this initiative, we have great hopes for what we can accomplish in West Virginia to further deliver solutions that have impact on the world.”

State leaders said the initiative will spur the growth of new technologies, investments, and economic development for companies and people in the area, establishing the start of an innovation corridor across the Appalachian Region.

Alongside LG’s jobs commitment, an investment fund is being created with plans to invest $700 million in West Virginia over the next five years to grow these businesses.

“This is another spotlight on the innovation and advancement occurring in the great state of West Virginia,” said Mitch Carmichael, secretary of the West Virginia Department of Economic Development.

The announcement ceremony ended with a group singalong of “Country Roads.”"

Nov 28 2023,UAMS receives a $17.6 million grant to help Arkansas healthcare,THV11,center,https://thv11.com/article/news/local/uams-receives-grant-help-arkansas-healthcare/91-a1ec8318-45a7-46d2-907c-f460150d6ab8,"UAMS has received a $17.6 million renewal grant to increase the number of primary care physicians in rural areas across Arkansas.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — Any time money is involved it brings excitement, but this joy has been bigger than the eye can see.

The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) received a $17.6 million federal grant renewal to further its goal of increasing the number of practicing primary care physicians in the state of Arkansas.

""By identifying students, and helping students that we think have a high likelihood of going to practice in rural communities, we identify them early, help them through medical school, provide experiences that they otherwise wouldn't have had and this grant is what provides the funding for that,"" Dr. Richard Turnage, professor of surgery and the Vice Chancellor for Regional Programs at UAMS said.

He explained how it's no secret that we have a shortage of primary care physicians in Arkansas but with UAMS receiving this grant they hope it will provide a boost in healthcare around the state.

""What this does is it attracts students from rural and underserved communities into medical school, and then it helps those students through medical school and identifies primary care as a career that they're interested in,"" Dr. Turnage said.

The objective is for him to recruit and retain medical students to stay in rural communities in Arkansas and it's something he and D. Wayne Bryant have in common.

Dr. Bryant also wants to help invest back in communities and help eliminate the wait time to see a doctor.

""That travel time can be a lot for patients, sometimes they don't even do regular follow-ups because of this distance, and so now being able to have the opportunity in their own city to have a physician that they can see and they can be around their community and have that doctor understand the community and what they're going through, I think that's important to have that for them,"" Dr. Bryant described.

Besides having the relationship of a sense of familiarity between a doctor and patient Bryant said the huge takeaway from this is exceeding beyond big city limits and providing healthcare access for everyone.

""Just being able to have the access to care, having that doctor that if you have a cold, or you have diabetes management or hypertension. Or even if you have a hospital in your area where you can be seen so you don't have to travel hundreds of miles just to be seen. to get taken care of. and we do a great job here at UAMS. It also helps like reduce some of the burden here at our own hospital by having them being seen over in the rural areas,"" Dr. Bryant said.

According to a spokesperson at UAMS, the grant will allow for all of the following:

Recruitment and outreach programs for prospective students

Scholarships for medical students interested in primary care specialties (family medicine, internal medicine, obstetrics/gynecology or pediatrics

A faculty mentorship program to connect students with primary care physicians

Community immersion rotations for students in rural and medically underserved areas

Faculty development for community physician preceptors"

The program, which was announced in May by Gov. Gavin Newsom, will provide health insurance for approximately 700,000 illegal immigrant residents aged 26-49.

California has been providing free health insurance to illegal immigrants who are under 26-years-old since 2019.

The program will begin on Jan. 1, 2024 and will provide more illegal immigrants with health insurance under the state's Medi-Cal coverage.

CALIFORNIA FACES ‘SEVERE REVENUE DECLINE,' RECORD $68 BILLION BUDGET DEFICIT AS MASS EXODUS CONTINUES

When he proposed the bill two years ago, Newsom called the expansion ""a transformative step towards strengthening the healthcare system for all Californians.""

California's Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly called the bill the future ""national model"" for ""expanding access, reducing costs, improving services, and closing equity gaps.""

WEALTHY CALIFORNIANS ARE FLEEING THE STATE, PUTTING TAX REVENUE AT RISK

""No other state in the country has done more in the space of health care access and affordability than the state of California,"" Dr. Ghaly said. ""I am proud of this Administration’s work to pioneer a comprehensive health care system that will become a national model for expanding access, reducing costs, improving services, and closing equity gaps.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Gov. Newsom's office said that they believe that everyone deserves access to health care.

""In California, we believe everyone deserves access to quality, affordable health care coverage – regardless of income or immigration status,"" Newsom's office said. ""Through this expansion, we’re making sure families and communities across California are healthier, stronger, and able to get the care they need when they need it.""

The Cost

According to state Sen. María Durazo, D-Calif., the Medi-Cal expansion to include all illegall immigrants is expected to cost $2.6 billion annually.

GOV. NEWSOM ADDRESSES CALIFORNIA EXODUS, TELLS AMERICANS ‘DON’T COUNT US OUT'

The added cost comes as California is faced with a major budget crisis due to a ""severe revenue decline.""

According to California's non-partisan Legislative Analyst's Office (LAO) report released Thursday, the state's budget deficit has grown exponentially in just a few months' time, up more than $54 billion from just $14.3 billion in June.

The growing budget deficit comes as residents and businesses have fled the predominately Democrat-run state.

California saw its first-ever population decline in 2020 when the state imposed rigid lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.

From January 2020 to July 2022, the state lost well over half a million people, with the number of residents leaving surpassing those moving in by almost 700,000.

According to the Los Angeles Times, economic factors like the cost of living and the housing market have also contributed to people moving out of California, and so has remote work.

Oct 04 2023,Largest healthcare strike in US history begins,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/largest-healthcare-strike-in-us-history-begins,"More than 75,000 healthcare workers began a strike Wednesday morning at 6 a.m. and will continue until Friday morning, making it the largest healthcare strike in American history.

The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, representing healthcare workers and support staff for one of the largest not-for-profit medical systems, announced last week that it would strike if contract negotiations failed with management.

DESANTIS BEGINS TO TAKE THE GLOVES OFF AGAINST TRUMP

Critical patient care staff through the Kaiser Permanente system, including EMTs, nurses, and radiological and lab technicians, will be taking a three-day walkout against unfair labor practices in California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado.

Pharmacists and optometrists are the only healthcare workers striking in Washington, D.C., and Virginia.

Kaiser is a vertically integrated and member-driven healthcare system that coordinates daily and specialist care within the same network.

Understaffing at Kaiser has been exacerbated by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wave of early retirements and burnout among healthcare workers.

The coalition is demanding pay raises for all union members as well as improved retiree benefits to compensate for what they identify as being overworked. The unions are also requesting additional protections from outsourcing.

Kaiser has made statements previously that it would continue negotiations with the unions in order to come to a resolution.

Neither Kaiser Permanente nor the Coalition responded to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment."
Oct 02 2023,Historic healthcare strike could start Wednesday,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/healthcare/historic-healthcare-strike-start-oct-4,"The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions is poised for a three-day strike starting Wednesday, which would be the largest healthcare worker walkout in U.S. history.

More than 75,000 healthcare workers across five states and Washington, D.C., will be holding an unfair labor practices strike after contract negotiations failed to produce a new agreement for the expiration date passed at midnight on Saturday.

EPA STATE GRANTS COULD FUND GREEN POLICIES DEMOCRATS COULDN’T GET AT FEDERAL LEVEL

“This three-day strike will be the initial demonstration of our strength to Kaiser that we will not stand for their unfair labor practices,” the coalition said in a statement. “If Kaiser continues to commit unfair labor practices, we are prepared to engage in another longer, stronger strike in November.”

Kaiser Permanente is a vertically integrated healthcare system in which individual and employer members pay dues to access daily and specialist care. Physician services as well as radiologic imaging, lab testing, and pharmaceuticals are coordinated within the network.

The organization employs nearly 24,000 physicians and over 87,000 non-physician staff, serving nearly 13 million patient members.

Although doctors, hospital managers, and registered nurses cannot legally take part in the strike, other medical staff members who support hospital operations are likely to participate, including nursing assistants, pharmacists, X-ray and laboratory technicians, and genetic counselors.

Workers cite chronic understaffing problems and burnout as chief reasons for why they would picket the company that union members brand as “out of touch.”

Understaffing at Kaiser has been exacerbated by the massive exodus of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding wave of early retirements. This, coupled with increasing demand for routine care delayed during the pandemic, has increased the burden on the remaining healthcare staff.

The coalition, consisting of eight separate unions across the various regions supplied by Kaiser, is demanding across-the-board pay raises as well as lowering the financial metric for bonus payouts and improved retiree benefits. The unions are also requesting protections from outsourcing and contract workers and required union membership for employees from smaller firms acquired by the larger company.

“Kaiser continues to bargain in bad faith over these issues and, so far, there is no light at the end of the tunnel,” the coalition said in a press statement published Saturday.

Kaiser Permanente management issued a statement on Sunday saying it will continue negotiations “in good faith” as the week progresses in an effort to avoid the “unnecessary strike.”

“We have contingency plans in place to ensure members continue to receive safe, high-quality care for the duration of the strike,” the company said."

Oct 04 2023,Support requested for Healthcare Heroes devastated by Maui wildfires,Maui Now News,center,https://mauinow.com/2023/10/04/support-requested-for-healthcare-heroes-devastated-by-maui-wildfires,"

















In the wake of the devastating Maui wildfires that have left thousands without homes, Maui Health nurse Sarah Salmonese is praying she can find a way to stay on Maui.

Salmonese has been in healthcare for over 11 years and was Maui Memorial Medical Center’s first-ever DAISY Award honoree, an international award recognizing extraordinary nurses. She lost her home and all of her belongings in the Lahaina fire.

“I worked so hard to be able to purchase my first home by myself,” she said. “What keeps me up at night is the uncertainty… how long until I can rebuild, and can I afford to stay on Maui paying rent until then.”

Similarly, nurse Christina Pilapil worries about housing for her family of seven.

“We’ve moved from one hotel to another several times over the last few weeks,” she said. “We’re so thankful to have been provided a room, but moving over and over with my husband, 9-year-old daughter, three kupuna, and dog, has been incredibly hard. We’re looking for somewhere to call home for a little while.”

Salmonese and Pilapil are just two of the hundreds of healthcare heroes who have lost their homes and everything they own to the recent fires. They and many others are desperately seeking short- and long-term rentals; many of whom have multiple children and large extended families, and all who have been traumatized by the recent disaster.

All of these individuals have selflessly cared for our loved ones during some of the most challenging times and now find themselves in dire need of help. Maui Health is asking people to consider helping those who have given so much.

“Our dedicated healthcare workers are the unsung heroes of our community, putting their own lives on the line to protect ours, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Marian Horikawa-Barth, Maui Health Chief Nurse Executive. “They need a place to call home to start rebuilding their lives.”

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

Together with Maui Health Foundation, Maui Health was able to place employees in short-term housing and provide monetary support immediately following the fires in early August. However, locating longer-term accommodations and lodging for larger families has been challenging. Maui Health is now reaching out to remind community members, local businesses, and other organizations of the significant and urgent need for housing on Maui.

Individuals and families who have vacant rental properties, guesthouses, or any suitable housing options, are asked to consider renting them to an individual or family in need. Sign ups are available with the Hawaiʻi Housing Finance & Development Corporation’s Hawaiʻi Fire Relief Housing Program, which the state operates. For questions or more information, email [email protected] or call 808-587-0469.

If you want to put your rental on a list specifically for healthcare workers, please contact Gabriel Bolivar at 808-442-5772 or [email protected].

“It is no secret that we are facing a shortage of healthcare workers, with access to affordable housing in Hawaii one of our biggest recruitment challenges,” said Horikawa-Barth. “We would hate for our amazing local healthcare professionals who lost everything to the fires to have to consider moving to the mainland because they can’t find housing. As a united community, we can show them we are here for them, just as they have always been here for us.”

Despite the challenges, Salmonese and Pilapil are hopeful and grateful.

Salmonese is thankful for how quickly the community came together to support each other. She is also grateful to be alive and says her calling to serve others may have saved her life.

“I went into healthcare to help my community, and as it turned out, I was right where I was supposed to be the night of the fires – working in the ER. So, while I’m devastated, I am also grateful for many things,” she said.

A silver lining for Pilapil is spending more quality time with her family.

“This experience has made us stronger and brought us closer to God,” she said. “To anyone else out there suffering, don’t give up. Have faith in God.”

-

The University of Oklahoma is getting a $16 million federal grant to address the healthcare shortage in underserved communities.

The grant will be used over the next four years to recruit, retain, and graduate medical students from tribal, rural, and medically underserved communities across Oklahoma.

The goal is for those students to go on to practice in their home communities.

The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Steven Crawford, Doctor of Family and Preventative Medicine at OU College of Medicine, hopes this grant will bridge the healthcare gap for underserved communities in Oklahoma.

“We hope students who come from those areas seek careers they may not have thought they were capable of seeking. And then go back and serve their communities and improve the health of those communities. Hopefully, on that same day, they would encourage other students to pursue careers that were again, something that wasn’t available,"" Dr. Crawford said.

Dr. Crawford encourages students who have an interest in the medical field to reach out to the college.

Nov 01 2023,Tennessee teens ask Supreme Court to block trans healthcare ban,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/11/02/tennessee-teens-supreme-court-trans-ban,"Transgender teenagers from Tennessee are formally asking the US Supreme Court to consider blocking their state’s ban on gender-affirming healthcare for minors.

Accompanied by their parents, a doctor, and the state ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), the three teens asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday (1 November) to block the ban which would put restrictions on trans minors’ access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy.

Last month a lower court, the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals, allowed for gender-affirming healthcare for minors bans to remain in effect in both Tennessee and Kentucky.

In Tennessee, the ban punishes healthcare providers who offer gender-affirming care to minors with a $25,000 penalty.

It also includes a phase-out period by 31 March 2024 for those who are currently receiving now-banned gender-affirming care.

If the Supreme Court agrees to hear this case, it will mark the first time it has considered a restriction on puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for minors.

One of three teens petitioning the Supreme Court, identified only as L.W., said: “I’m fighting this law because I know how important this care is for tens of thousands of transgender youth like me.

“It scares me to think about losing the medication that I need and if this law continues, my family may have to leave Tennessee – the place I have lived and loved my entire life.

The 15-year-old transgender girl continued, per NBC News: “And with so many new laws like Tennessee’s, it is hard to imagine where we can even go. I want the justices to know transgender people are not going away and that we deserve the same rights as everyone else.”

If the Supreme Court agrees to hear this case, it will mark the first time it has considered a restriction on puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery for minors. (Getty)

Lucas Cameron-Vaughn, staff attorney for the ACLU of Tennessee added in a statement: “Over the past few months this vicious law has already had a disastrous impact in homes and communities across Tennessee.

“Families are losing access to much-needed medical care that has allowed their children to flourish.

“This law denies these families’ dignity and signals to their children that they do not have the freedom to lead healthy and happy lives.”

The ACLU writes in this week’s petition that the Circuit Court of Appeals “broke with numerous precedents of this Court” when they allowed for the ban to remain.

It also notes that the ban violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by discriminating, as cisgender children may still access treatment that trans youth are banned from in order to treat other conditions.

Additionally, it violates the 14th Amendment’s due process clause, which promises parents the right to make decisions concerning the medical care of their children.

The ACLU argues that the Circuit Court’s ruling has created “legal uncertainty” regarding healthcare for trans youths, “creating chaos across the country for adolescents, families, and doctors.”

Kentucky attorneys representing trans minors affected by their state’s gender-affirming care ban also plan to petition the Supreme Court this week.

Both states are now among 22 US states in which bans on gender-affirming care for minors have become law, despite widespread support for gender-affirming care for both minors and adults among the medical community.

All major medical associations, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, have publicly stated their opposition to such state bans, while countless studies have proven that gender-affirming care reduces suicidality and improves mental health."

Oct 24 2023,Healthcare workers hit picket lines again at Providence St. Joseph in Burbank,Pasadena Star-News,center,https://pasadenastarnews.com/2023/10/24/healthcare-workers-hit-picket-lines-again-at-providence-st-joseph-in-burbank,"Striking health care workers at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank hit the picket lines on Tuesday, Oct. 24, for a second straight day in their planned five-day walkout, as Providence management once again criticized picketers for what hospital officials said was excessive noise near patients.

The hospital also said pickets were creating safety hazards, and asked the union “to limit noise near patient rooms.”

“Sadly, the union’s decision to march through the main circular driveway — and near the entrance to our Emergency Department — shouting, clanging cow bells and blowing whistles is producing intense noise that can be heard in the units with our most vulnerable patients,” the hospital said in a statement Tuesday.

“Equally concerning are safety issues. One car blocked an ambulance while delivering coffee to protesters. In other instances, protesters in the main driveway prevented an ambulance attempting to transport a patient who waited 30 minutes on a gurney in the lobby, and a Burbank Fire Department rescue squad reported picketers in the street created a hazard.”

The hospital statement said nurse leaders in the emergency department, intensive care unit, NICU, maternity and other departments “are concerned for their patients and visitors, some we fear will feel intimidated trying to enter our hospital for care or to see their critically ill family members.”

But in a sharply worded reply to the noise and safety complaints, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West spokeswoman Renée Saldaña said, “There are lots of frontline caregivers who can speak to how Providence’s staffing is putting patients at risk, and we aren’t going to play into their desperate attempts to divert from that.”

“The strike is being caused by Providence’s unfair labor practices, its failure to invest in caregivers, and the chronic short staffing that undermines quality care every day,” Saldaña said. “Providence is attempting to silence health care workers so they don’t speak out about the unsafe conditions they witness at work. The real issue is about not having enough staff to be there for patients when they are needed, maintaining a sanitary work environment, and providing life-sustaining care.

“If Providence wants to end the strike, it should stop its unfair labor practices and resume negotiations immediately to stop the Providence short-staffing crisis,” Saldaña continued. “SEIU-UHW members are committed to delivering the best care to the communities we serve. Frontline health care workers are ready, and we won’t be silenced.”

SEIU-UHW represents the 700 non-nursing health care workers staging the walkout.

In the latest strike to hit a Southland hospital in recent weeks, the non-nursing health care workers at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank began an unfair-labor practice walkout on Monday. Workers began picketing around 6 a.m. and continued until 3:30 p.m. —and they drew criticism early Monday from Providence Southern California for what hospital officials said was behavior that was disruptive toward patients.

“We are extremely disappointed by the union’s decision to shout and make excessive noise on the hospital property, a few feet from where our patients are under our care,” the hospital said in a statement. “Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center is a place of healing and we ask that the union respect that. These are members of our community and they deserve the best care possible. We respect the rights of the union to picket on the sidewalk but ask that they respect those who are under our care.”

A statement Sunday from Providence said the walkout would have “no impacts” on patient care, and that the strike comes after “our best efforts to engage in meaningful dialogue at the bargaining table,” along with the offer of “significant wage increases.”

“The union has offered unrealistic counterproposals in response and has chosen to strike instead of continue with good-faith negotiations,” the hospital statement said.

The employees — including lab technicians, phlebotomists, EMTs, patient transporters, EVS workers and others — plan to continue their walkout until Friday, according to the SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West union.

Providence said on Sunday it has contracted with replacement workers to fill in for striking union members.

Specific union concerns, according to an SEIU-UHW statement, include “longstanding issues of understaffing, worker turnover and patient care concerns,” in addition to higher wages.

The union, which gave a 10-day notice last week of its intended strike, said it is taking the “last resort” action after months of bargaining.

An SEIU-UHW spokeswoman, Maria Leal, said contract talks broke off after the sides’ last bargaining session on Oct. 13. The union’s contract expired on Aug. 5, and the sides began talks in June, Leal said.

“We are being intimidated and threatened for wanting to improve our hospital, while Providence executives bargain in bad faith over solutions to our short-staffing crisis,” Christian Ayon, a lead surgical technician at Providence St. Joseph, said in a statement released by the union.

“This used to be a premier hospital, but we are struggling to give the quality care our patients deserve as we watch staff leave and positions go unfilled. We fight not just for ourselves but for our patients that depend on us.”

Providence officials said Sunday they have offered the union “what we believe is a very generous package with significant wage increases” —including a 24% wage increase over a three-year contract and market wage adjustments for many jobs.

Addressing the union’s charge that patient care has suffered, the hospital statement said, “If there are incidents of unsafe conditions or poor quality care, the law requires that they be reported and investigated by the appropriate government agencies. That has not happened. In fact, just three months ago, the U.S. agency that oversees hospital quality ranked Providence Saint Joseph among the top 17.3% in the nation for overall quality.”

The Providence statement went on to say, “The union has also accused hospital management of engaging in bad faith bargaining and other illegal tactics, including silencing workers. Providence Saint Joseph is committed to respectful discourse and urges caregivers to report concerns in a variety of ways, including via an anonymous integrity hotline.”

Providence acknowledged high turnover rates since the pandemic, but said, “We have aggressively recruited and continue to do so, providing bonuses to caregivers who refer qualified candidates and to those hired in certain positions.”

“It is public record that Providence Saint Joseph and many other hospitals and health organizations continue to suffer financially, post-pandemic,” the hospital statement said.

The Providence strike follows a three-day walkout over many of the same issues by some 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers from several states, including California, from Oct. 4-6. The sides in that dispute announced a tentative four-year agreement on Oct. 13.

Workers at St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood also walked off the job for five days from Oct. 9-13."
Nov 06 2023,"Local officials, healthcare providers react to Williston State College’s medical training facility",KFYR,center,https://kfyrtv.com/2023/11/06/local-officials-healthcare-providers-react-williston-state-colleges-medical-training-facility,"WILLISTON, N.D. (KUMV) - The City of Williston and Williams County says expanding healthcare access in the region is key to population growth. Williston State College’s latest project will train students interested in going into healthcare fields.

With financial support from the state legislature, Williston State College will build a nearly $37 million medical training facility. College President Bernell Hirning says this facility will keep healthcare workers in the region versus having them finish their education elsewhere.

“[They can] complete years three and four and any other clinical work they would do in-person here right in Williston. We want [students] to be here in-person and they want to be here in-person,” said Hirning.

Of the new classes for the new facility, behavioral health is one in high demand locally. Clinical Director for Eckert Youth Home Dr. Leah Hoffman says the facility could help them get more workers.

“The one thing that keeps Eckert from growing as a behavioral health provider would be staff. We can get as big as we want as long as we have the staff to provide the services,” said Hoffman.

Williams County invested millions of dollars in behavioral health services through behavioral health grants in 2021 and 2023.

“A great way to grow our provider base is really creating that pipeline for education to be able to get students interested in the field. So, the building of the pipeline is a great way to grow our providers,” said County Community Engagement Coordinator Lindsey Harriman.

Paramedics and EMS courses would also benefit ambulance services around the region.

“It gives us at least a chance to make sure we have people that know what they are getting into when they go back to their communities and man the ambulance services,” said Williston Mayor Howard Klug.

The college and JLG Architects held public forums last week to discuss the possible designs for the facility. They hope to begin construction by next fall and be open in 2025.

Hirning says he plans on offering several courses like behavioral health, CMA and office support staff next year before the new facility is open.

Oct 04 2023,"75,000 Healthcare Workers Go on Strike Over Wages",Newsmax (News),right,https://newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/kaiser-healthcare-workers/2023/10/04/id/1136907,"Picketing began Wednesday morning at Kaiser Permanente hospitals as some 75,000 healthcare workers go on strike in Virginia, California and three other states over wages and staffing shortages, marking the latest major labor unrest in the United States.

Kaiser Permanente is one of the country’s larger insurers and healthcare system operators, with 39 hospitals nationwide. The non-profit company, based in Oakland, California, provides health coverage for nearly 13 million people, sending customers to clinics and hospitals it runs or contracts with to provide care.

The Coalition of Kaiser Permanente Unions, representing about 85,000 of the health system's employees nationally, approved a strike for three days in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington, and for one day in Virginia and Washington, D.C.

The strikers include licensed vocational nurses, home health aides and ultrasound sonographers, as well as technicians in radiology, X-ray, surgical, pharmacy and emergency departments.

Doctors are not participating, and Kaiser says its hospitals, including emergency rooms, will remain open during the picketing. The company said it was bringing in thousands of temporary workers to fill gaps during the strike. But the strike could lead to delays in getting appointments and non-urgent procedures being rescheduled.

It comes amid unprecedented worker organizing — from strike authorizations to work stoppages — within multiple industries this year, including, transportation, entertainment and hospitality.

Wednesday's strike is the latest one for the healthcare industry this year as it continues to confront burnout with the heavy workloads — problems that were exacerbated greatly by the pandemic.

Unions representing Kaiser workers in August asked for a $25 hourly minimum wage, as well as increases of 7% each year in the first two years and 6.25% each year in the two years afterward.

They say understaffing is boosting the hospital system’s profits but hurting patients, and executives have been bargaining in bad faith during negotiations.

“They're not listening to the frontline healthcare workers,” said Mikki Fletchall, a licensed vocational nurse based in a Kaiser medical office in Camarillo, California. “We're striking because of our patients. We don't want to have to do it, but we will do it.”

Kaiser has proposed minimum hourly wages of between $21 and $23 next year depending on the location.

Since 2022, the hospital system has hired 51,000 workers and has plans to add 10,000 more people by the end of the month.

Kaiser Permanente reported $2.1 billion in net income for this year’s second quarter on more than $25 billion in operating revenue. But the company said it still was dealing with cost headwinds and challenges from inflation and labor shortages.

Kaiser executive Michelle Gaskill-Hames defended the company and said its practices, compensation and retention are better than its competitors, even as the entire sector faces the same challenges.

“Our focus, for the dollars that we bring in, are to keep them invested in value-based care,” said Gaskill-Hames, president of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals of Southern California and Hawaii.

She added that Kaiser only faces 7% turnover compared to the industry standard of 21%, despite the effects of the pandemic.

“I think coming out of the pandemic, healthcare workers have been completely burned out,"" she said. ""The trauma that was felt caring for so many COVID patients, and patients that died, was just difficult.”

The workers’ last contract was negotiated in 2019, before the pandemic.

Hospitals generally have struggled in recent years with high labor costs, staffing shortages and rising levels of uncompensated care, according to Rick Gundling, a senior vice president with the Healthcare Financial Management Association, a nonprofit that works with health care finance executives.

Most of their revenue is fixed, coming from government-funded programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Gundling noted. He said that means revenue growth is “only possible by increasing volumes, which is difficult even under the best of circumstances.”

Workers calling for higher wages, better working conditions and job security, especially since the end of the pandemic, have been increasingly willing to walk out on the job as employers face a greater need for workers.

The California legislature has sent Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill that would increase the minimum wage for the state’s 455,000 healthcare workers to $25 per hour over the next decade. The governor has until Oct. 14 to decide whether to sign or veto it."
Oct 02 2023,Nebraska further restricts healthcare for trans youth despite protests,PinkNews,left,https://thepinknews.com/2023/10/03/nebraska-restricts-healthcare-trans-youth,"The state of Nebraska has introduced further restrictions on healthcare for trans youth in new emergency regulations.

A new bill, LB 574, went into effect on Sunday, 1 October, despite protests and concerns raised by families, doctors, lawmakers, and advocates.

LB 574 bans all transition-related surgeries for transgender people under the age of 19 and requires trans minors to undergo at least 40 hours of “gender-identity-focused” therapy that are “clinically neutral.”

This has raised alarm bells among transgender activists who fear this could be a form of non-affirming therapy.

Gender exploratory therapy seeks to find any other explanation for being trans other than genuine transness.

After meeting all of the above criteria, patients would then have to endure a seven-day waiting period before they can start their prescriptions so they have “enough time to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment.”

Despite protests and serious concerns raised by families, medical professionals, and lawmakers, Republican Governor Jim Pillen approved the regulations, which will remain in effect while the department takes public comments and decides on more permanent regulations.

The state capital is set to hold a public hearing on the matter on 28 November.

This new bill was introduced alongside an equally controversial 12-week abortion ban.

Hundreds of advocates, doctors, and businesses signed a letter that warned against both bills, which were described as a “direct attack on the medical community of our state.

The letter, which earned over 1,200 signatures, included threats from medical professionals that they would leave the state if the bills were passed.

At the time of writing, at least 22 US states have enacted laws to restrict or outright ban gender-affirming care for minors – many of which are facing lawsuits as a result.

That’s despite all major medical groups including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommending gender-affirming care to minors and warning that restricting access could threaten their health.

Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Nebraska State Capitol on Sunday to fight for their healthcare.

Speaking to KMTV, Grant Friedman of the ACLU of Nebraska said: “October 1st is not a happy day for our community.

“I’m so glad we’re all here to show and speak out to the fact it is the decision of doctors on their medical expertise and not of our legislators to decide what is medically necessary care.”

Another protester, Nathan Hé, commented: “To be very honest, I’m terrified. Petrified. But, at the same time, seeing what’s happening around here and seeing the amount of people showing up to support me, I’m also hopeful.”

Still, the bill was swiftly signed by Pillen on Sunday, who said at the signing ceremony that children and parents seeking gender-affirming care were being “duped.”

Reacting to the surprise bill passing, Nebraskan Senator Megan Hunt took to X (formerly Twitter), to condemn the move.

“These temporary emergency rules and regulations were drafted in secret, they put politicians in our doctors’ offices, and they put big government bureaucracy over parents rights, bodily autonomy, and medical privacy,” she wrote.

“I don’t trust politicians to make my medical decisions, and neither should you. I trust Nebraskans, their doctors, and the 30 major national and international medical associations, including the AMA and APA, that endorse gender-affirming care.”"
Nov 06 2023,"New Mexico emerges as gender-affirming healthcare haven, but patient waitlists grow",Staten Island Advance,center,https://silive.com/reckon/2023/11/new-mexico-emerges-as-gender-affirming-healthcare-haven-but-patient-waitlists-grow.html,"A roundup of conversations we're having daily on the site. Subscribe to the Reckon Daily for stories centering marginalized communities and speaking to the under-covered issues of the moment.

This summer, Sophia Machado packed her bags and left her home in Oregon to move to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where her sister lived and where, Machado had heard, residents were friendlier to their transgender neighbors and gender-affirming healthcare was easier to get.

Machado, 36, is transgender and has good health insurance through her job. Within weeks, she was able to get into a small primary care clinic, where her sister was already a patient and where the doctor was willing to refill her estrogen prescription and refer her to an endocrinologist.

She felt fortunate. “I know that a lot of the larger medical institutions here are pretty slammed,” she said.

Other patients seeking gender-affirming health care in New Mexico, where access is protected by law, haven’t been as lucky.

After her primary care doctor retired in 2020, Anne Withrow, a 73-year-old trans woman who has lived in Albuquerque for over 50 years, sought care at Truman Health Services, a clinic specializing in transgender health care at the University of New Mexico. “They said, ‘We have a waiting list.’ A year later they still had a waiting list. A year later, before I managed to go back, I got a call,” she said.

But instead of the clinic, the caller was a provider from a local community-based health center who had gotten her name and was able to see her. Meanwhile, the state’s premier clinic for transgender health is still at capacity as of October and unable to accept new patients. Officials said they have stopped trying to maintain a waitlist and instead refer patients elsewhere.

Over the past two years, as nearly half of states passed legislation restricting gender-affirming healthcare, many transgender people began relocating to states that protect access. But not all those states have had the resources to serve everyone. Cities like San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, D.C., have large LGBTQ+ health centers, but the high cost of living keeps many people from settling there. Instead, many have chosen to move to New Mexico, which has prohibited restrictions on gender-affirming care, alongside states like Minnesota, Colorado, Vermont and Washington.

But those new arrivals have found that trans-friendly laws don’t necessarily equate to easy access. Instead, they find themselves added to ever-growing waitlists for care in a small state with a long-running physician shortage.

“With the influx of gender-refugees, wait times have increased to the point that my doctor and I have planned on bi-yearly exams,” Felix Wallace, a 30-year-old trans man, said in an email.

When T. Michael Trimm started working at the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico in late 2020, he said, the center fielded two or three calls a month from people thinking about moving to the state. “Since then, it has steadily increased to a pace of one or two a week,” he said. “We’ve had folks from as far away as Florida and Kentucky and West Virginia.” That’s not to mention families in Texas “looking to commute here for care, which is a whole other can of worms, trying to access care that’s legal here but illegal where they live.”

In its 2023 legislative session, New Mexico passed several laws protecting LGBTQ+ rights, including one that prohibits public bodies from restricting gender-affirming care.

“I feel really excited and proud to be here in New Mexico, where it’s such a strong stance and such a strong refuge state,” said Molly McClain, a family medicine physician and medical director of the Deseo clinic, which serves transgender youth at the University of New Mexico Hospital. “And I also don’t think that that translates to having a lot more care available.”

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has designated part or all of 32 of New Mexico’s 33 counties as health professional shortage areas. A 2022 report found the state had lost 30 percent of its physicians in the previous four years. The state is on track to have the second-largest physician shortage in the country by 2030 and it already has the oldest physician workforce. The majority of providers offering gender-affirming care are near Albuquerque and Santa Fe, but 60 percent of the state’s population live in rural regions.

Even in Albuquerque, waitlists to see any doctor are long, which can be difficult for patients desperate for care. McClain noted that the rates of self-harm and suicidal ideation can be very high for transgender people who are not yet able to fully express their identity.

That said, Trimm adds that “trans folks can be very resilient.”

Some trans people have to wait many years to receive transition-related medical care, even “when they’ve known this all their lives,” he said. Although waiting for care can be painful, he hopes a waitlist is easier to endure “than the idea that you maybe could never get the care.”

New Mexico had already become a haven for patients seeking abortion care, which was criminalized in many surrounding states over the past two years. But McClain noted that providing gender-affirming care requires more long-term considerations, because patients will need to be seen regularly the rest of their lives. We’re “working really hard to make sure that it is sustainable,” she said.

As part of that work, McClain and others at the University of New Mexico, in partnership with the Transgender Resource Center, have started a gender-affirming care workshop to train providers statewide. They especially want to reach those in rural areas. The program began in June and has had about 90 participants at each of its biweekly sessions. McClain estimates about half have been from rural areas.

“It’s long been my mantra that this is part of primary care,” McClain said. As New Mexico has protected access to care, she’s seen more primary care providers motivated to offer puberty blockers, hormone therapy and other services to their trans patients. “The point really is to enable people to feel comfortable and confident providing gender care wherever they are.”

There are still significant logistical challenges to providing gender-affirming care in New Mexico, said Anjali Taneja, a family medicine physician and executive director of Casa de Salud, an Albuquerque primary care clinic serving uninsured and Medicaid patients.

“There are companies that are outright refusing to provide [malpractice] insurance coverage for clinics doing gender-affirming care,” she said. Casa de Salud has long offered gender-affirming care but, Taneja said, it was only this year that the clinic found malpractice insurance that would allow it to treat trans youth.

Meanwhile, reproductive health organizations and providers are trying to open a clinic — one that will also offer gender-affirming care — in southern New Mexico, with $10 million from the state legislature. Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains will be part of that effort and, although the organization does not yet offer gender-affirming care in New Mexico, spokesperson Kayla Herring said it plans to do so.

Machado said the vitriol and hatred directed at the trans community in recent years is frightening. But if anything good has come of it, it’s the attention the uproar has brought to trans stories and health care “so that these conversations are happening, rather than it being something where you have to explain to your doctor,” she said. “I feel very lucky that I was able to come here because I feel way safer here than I did in other places.”

Dec 28 2021,The CDC’s solution to healthcare worker shortages could backfire,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/2107273/the-cdc-cut-quarantine-for-healthcare-workers/,"The US is going through yet another surge in covid-19 cases, this time amidst a shortage of healthcare workers that could drive hospitals and clinics to a breaking point.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than half a million healthcare workers have left their jobs because of burnout, poor working conditions, and a sense of not receiving enough protection and appreciation. Now, as they handle the new surge of covid-19 cases, many are having to leave their posts after becoming infected with omicron themselves.

“Every [healthcare] institution I know has had countless healthcare workers who contracted covid over the last couple of weeks, more than I’ve seen in this entire pandemic,” says Shikha Jain, CEO of Impact, an advocacy organization for healthcare workers.

To address the shortage, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released emergency guidance on Dec. 23, decreasing the time healthcare workers have to quarantine if they test positive with covid-19. The goal is to have more personnel available, but it might have the opposite effect.

The risk of exposing patients, and other healthcare workers

The earlier guidance for healthcare workers was the same as for the general population, and isolation was required for 10 days. Shortening that is risky: Although it is unlikely, someone who tests negative for an antigen might still be contagious, particularly in asymptomatic cases.

Yet according to the CDC’s new omicron guidelines, asymptomatic healthcare workers who test positive for covid-19 can return to work seven days later if a second antigen test five days into their quarantine shows they are negative. The recommended isolation period can be reduced in case of staff shortages.

But there is little evidence quarantines can be shortened safely. “We don’t actually have data that can truly describe how long someone is infectious after they contract covid, whether they’re symptomatic or asymptomatic,” says Jain, who is also a medicine professor the University of Illinois.

This poses risks for patients, as healthcare workers are more likely to be in contact with vulnerable populations, and for their colleagues. Despite personal protective equipment, there is virtually no way to guarantee a potentially contagious person won’t spread the infection further. The virus could still escape, for instance, if they remove their mask for drinking or adjust it for comfort. Given omicron’s high infectiousness, the risk is especially high.

This means more healthcare staff might test positive and have to isolate, further reducing an already tight workforce.

Pushing healthcare workers out

Beyond the immediate health consequences, shortening the isolation period risks sending healthcare workers the wrong signal. It doesn’t take into account the importance of guaranteeing their safety in the workplace, says Jain.

The new guidance might be the last straw for many who feel strained by the pandemic and have been putting up with exasperating work conditions, she says. This might push even more healthcare personnel out of the workforce right as it’s needed the most.

“A lot of healthcare workers have reached out and told me that they feel that this just further shows that not only do people not appreciate what healthcare workers are doing, but that the healthcare system will continue to take and take from healthcare workers, and will do that until they have nothing left to give,” says Jain."

Mar 17 2020,Italy Totally Fine Thanks To Universal Healthcare,Babylon Bee (Humor),right,https://babylonbee.com/news/italy-totally-fine-thanks-to-universal-healthcare,"ITALY - A new report has found that Italy is doing completely fine with no problems whatsoever thanks to its lauded universal healthcare system.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the world, countries are going on lockdown, but not Italy. Its universal healthcare program means that everybody is doing great, ""incredible even.""

""It seems that having universal healthcare stops all health problems and magically makes enough medicine and care available for all,"" said one analyst. ""It's remarkable -- in countries where there is no universal healthcare, everybody is dying. In countries where there is universal healthcare, the virus just stops right at the border. It's not allowed in. That's just science.""

While backward countries with free market health systems are expected to be wiped out with a near 100% death rate, countries like Italy with universal healthcare continue to live life as though nothing is wrong. People are dancing in the streets and living out their utopian lives, unaware that the rest of the world is even facing a crisis.

""Coronavirus? Never heard of it,"" said one Italian man as he made a pizza ""just because."" ""Nope, we've got universal healthcare here. We have left behind your primitive ideas like disease, viruses, and even death itself.""

Canada is also doing perfect and absolutely will not lock its borders down to stop the crisis since ""borders are evil,"" according to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."

Oct 23 2013,The amazing politics of Healthcare.gov failure,Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2013/10/23/the_amazing_politics_of_healthcare_gov_failure/,"It got buried beneath an avalanche of Obamacare scrutiny and anti-Obamacare spin, but the most revealing statement about the future of the Affordable Care Act yesterday came in the form of a flustered conversation between a CNN host and Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C.

If you have nine minutes to spare, I recommend you watch the whole thing. But here's the short version.

An unusual arrangement in the commonwealth of Kentucky gave Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear the power to implement the Affordable Care Act almost by fiat. And he did it. The ironic consequence is that one of the most conservative states in the country, surrounded by states that have by and large tried to obstruct the law, now has one of its best functioning insurance exchanges, Kynect.

Because it was developed independently from Healthcare.gov -- and because Beshear's administration took great care to make the law work for skeptical constituents -- Kynect customers seem to be happy and are signing up by the thousands.

Ellmers' North Carolina doesn't share a border with Kentucky but it's safe to call it a neighboring state. Its population as a whole is less conservative than Kentucky's, but it's governed by conservative hard-liners. So it's no surprise that Ellmers hates Obamacare and uses Healthcare.gov's inauspicious launch to bolster the case that it should be repealed.

What's revealing is that when asked to contend with Obamacare's relative success across a couple of borders in Kentucky, she plunges into gibberish. She can't even begin to grapple with it.

Her reaction is a harbinger of future Obamacare politics if the administration can't make Healthcare.gov work and the insurance markets in states with federally administered exchanges begin to fail.

I suppose it's possible that if Obamacare fails in states that ceded the power to build their own exchanges, the legislative coalition shielding the law would begin to splinter. Doubtful. But we are talking 34 states, only a few of which are politically amenable to fixing it.

That would leave the U.S. healthcare system with a murky future.

On the other side of that coin, 14 states -- Kentucky among them, but also large-population states like California and New York -- are doing Obamacare as its authors envisioned. If, in a worst-case scenario, Obamacare is completely dysfunctional everywhere else next year, these states will still create a constituency of millions of people for the law right out the gate.

That will help immunize it from legislative mischief. But it'll also put legions of Republicans in the same position Ellmers found herself in on Tuesday -- forced to confront the reality that the law only isn't working for people whose states begged off the project, or undermined it intentionally. Many people living in those states will know that things would be better if only their elected leaders would just make their peace with Obamacare and make their own constituents' lives better by implementing it.

So what will happen? Well, first, I hope that the administration gets Healthcare.gov working and that people are ultimately able to enroll successfully wherever they live. As much as a small part of me (small, but bigger than I'd like to admit) thinks the reactionary leaders of these states are reaping what they've sown and should live with the consequences of their opportunistic abandonment of their phony commitment to states' rights, it would be better for everyone and better for liberalism for the administration to figure this out, soon. It'll also limit the long-term political damage to the law, and reduce the odds that Republican saboteurs in Congress ultimately get their way.

But if that doesn't happen, the night and day contrast between consumer experiences in states like Kentucky and North Carolina, or New York and New Jersey, will create new tensions between Republican governors and the activist right.

It turns out the politics of Obamacare will become much more interesting if Healthcare.gov never gets off the ground.

We're already seeing a similar dynamic play out in states as diverse as Arizona, Ohio and New Jersey, where Republican governors -- once conservative standard bearers, now fallen RINOs -- transgressed against their bases and agreed to implement the ACA's Medicaid expansion. The most important ACA news of the week had nothing to do with Healthcare.gov. It was that Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich circumvented the state Legislature to expand Medicaid, opening the program to about 300,000 new low-income beneficiaries.

The optimistic scenario -- well, the optimistic sub-scenario, if the federally facilitated marketplaces fail -- is that states without their own exchanges fall like dominoes and begin building them.

Perhaps a likelier scenario is that a dozen or so blue and purple states, plus a handful of red ones, would follow California and Kentucky's lead and go the states' rights way. Why wouldn't Chris Christie run to the rescue of New Jerseyans suffering under the yoke of federal overreach? Or Kasich. Or even Jan Brewer, who probably can't run for reelection anyhow, and already steamrolled the Arizona Legislature to expand Medicaid? The holdouts would largely be revanchist Southerners, bent upon pitting the most dubious of principles against their own interests.

That would leave the U.S. for a time with a bizarre, two-tiered healthcare system. One, for most people, that would work pretty well. Another highly dysfunctional one for post-policy conservatives, which would either last until the feds get it right, or slowly shrink over time as states recognized how pointless the stand they were taking really was."

May 10 2021,Biden bans discrimination against LGBTQ people in healthcare,LGBTQ Nation,left,https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/05/biden-bans-discrimination-lgbtq-people-healthcare/,"The Biden administration has reversed a Trump-era policy that allowed healthcare providers to discriminate against LGBTQ people if they claimed a religious exemption.

The move will reinstate Obamacare guidance and expand them to include the recent Supreme Court ruling that sex discrimination includes sexual orientation and gender identity.

Related: Dr. Rachel Levine makes history as first trans official confirmed by Senate. It’s about time.

“Fear of discrimination can lead individuals to forgo care, which can have serious negative health consequences,“ the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “Everyone – including LGBTQ people – should be able to access healthcare, free from discrimination or interference, period.”

The Trump administration claimed protections against sex discrimination only extended to “male or female as determined by biology.” But just three days after the rule was announced, the Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that the ban on discrimination “because of sex” in Title VII in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes anti-LGBTQ discrimination when it comes to employment. The landmark victory has affected how a broad array of anti-discrimination protections apply to LGBTQ people.

The change was part of a larger Trump administration program of rolling back protections for LGBTQ people enacted in the Obama administration. Other departments – including the Department of Education and the Department of Housing and Urban Development – also rolled back LGBTQ protections during the Trump administration, allowing more discrimination against homeless transgender people and trans students.

Those protections have also been restored by the Biden administration.

“The Supreme Court has made clear that people have a right not to be discriminated against on the basis of sex and receive equal treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual orientation,” Becerra said."

Mar 09 2017,GOP healthcare plan clears first hurdle,CNN (Online News),left,http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/08/politics/house-health-care-markup/,"Story highlights Republicans are holding the line to block Democratic efforts to delay the bill to repeal Obamacare The bill has already drawn criticism from rank-and-file lawmakers Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said the GOP bill had been kept ""as secret as Donald Trump's tax returns.""

Washington CNN —

The House Ways and Means Committee needed 18 hours to become the first panel to approve the Republicans’ Obamacare repeal bill, nearly a full day after debate began and with no end in sight.

Meanwhile Democrats in another committee are continuing to use as many procedural tactics as they can to delay the plan’s advancement.

White House and Republican congressional leaders had sought to fast-track the legislation through Congress. Democrats have made clear it wouldn’t be easy – dragging out a the grueling debate in the House Energy and Commerce Committee well into the next day.

In both committee rooms, GOP lawmakers dismissed questions about the bill’s cost and claims it would result in millions of Americans losing insurance coverage. Democrats mixed assaults on the legislation with diversionary tactics meant to embarrass Trump – such as highlighting his refusal to release his tax returns.

The action on Capitol Hill comes against a backdrop of pitched controversy over the legislation, which is posing a crucial first test to Trump’s capacity to move his agenda through Congress and as conservative Republicans complain that the initiative does not go far enough in erasing Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.

Opposition to the Republican health care bill had strengthened Wednesday, as key industry groups that had supported Obamacare said the replacement backed by President Donald Trump could harm vulnerable Americans.

The American Medical Association, which bills itself as the largest organization of doctors in the nation, sent a letter to the two committees, detailing its critique of the bill, known as the American Health Care Act.

“While we agree that there are problems with the ACA that must be addressed, we cannot support the AHCA as drafted because of the expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations,” the letter stated.

Major hospital organizations, including the American Hospital Association and the Federation of American hospitals have also come out against the bill. The largest seniors organization, the AARP had warned on Tuesday the measure would weaken Medicare and Medicaid. Some conservative medical lobby groups have supported the measure.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer shrugged off the building opposition from the medical establishment.

“We would love to have every group on board,” Spicer said, adding, “This isn’t about figuring out how many special interests in Washington we can get paid off. It’s about making sure that patients get the best deal, that lowers prices and brings back cost.”

Trump also showed willingness to jump into the fray, meeting with the leaders of conservative groups that have lined up against the bill.

“This is going to be great. You’re going to make it even greater,” the President told the group, sources at the White House meeting told CNN. “I’m going to work hard to get it done.”

But should the bill eventually fail, Trump outlined a backup plan: Allow Obamcare to fail and let Democrats take the blame, sources said.

Working late

It was a full day – and night – for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Two committees started their markups Wednesday morning at 10:30 a.m.

Eighteen hours in, the Energy and Commerce Committee was still debating the first Democratic amendment – which was to change the name of the bill. The Ways and Means Committee ended debate on the second of five subtitles in the bill shortly before 11 p.m.

In the Ways and Means meeting room, there were signs that the long day was wearing on lawmakers.

Around 8 p.m., the panel’s chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady, leaned back in his chair and put in eye drops.

Later, as restless staffers’ side conversations rose to regular volumes rather than whispers, Brady had to call the room to order. Shortly before 4:30 a.m. Thursday, they voted 23-16 to approve their portion of the House legislation.

Aides sat with blankets in their laps or around their shoulders in the overly air-conditioned room. One snuck in a box of Dunkin’ Donuts “Munchkins” to share.

The long day unfolded with a series of dry-as-a-bone discussions about health care policy and Democratic procedural measures to make the process as painful as possible for their Republican colleagues.

At one point, the minority forced the clerk of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to read the full bill – a procedure that took about an hour. Democrats have promised at least 100 amendments, most of which have no chance of passage. For instance, one defeated measure would have blocked health care reform coming into force unless it ensured coverage for every taxpayer and all their dependents.

The GOP legislation unveiled Monday would get rid of Obamacare’s individual mandate and put in place refundable tax credits for individuals to purchase health insurance. It also proposes restructuring Medicaid and defunding Planned Parenthood.

The bill looks to preserve some of the more popular elements of Obamacare, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions (though insurers would be allowed to charge higher premiums to individuals whose coverage has lapsed) and letting children stay on their parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26.

Democrats want CBO score

Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, cited the lack of a CBO report as a reason the effort should be postponed. “To consider a bill of this magnitude without a CBO score is not only puzzling and concerning, but also irresponsible,” Neal said.

Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said the GOP bill had been kept “as secret as Donald Trump’s tax returns.”

“It is surprising that you’re so determined to hide your panacea,” the Texas congressman told his Republican colleagues.

GOP leaders have said that the bill will not be brought to the floor until the CBO scores the legislation.

But while Republican Majority Whip Steve Scalise told the Energy committee that while he is also waiting for a CBO score, he will not let “unelected bureaucrats in Washington” slow down the Republican promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

One Democratic committee aide said the intent is to “make some Republicans take some really tough votes” that are “revealing” about the GOP’s priorities on health care.

Democratic Rep. Brian Higgins highlighted a provision of the bill that provides a tax break for health insurance companies amid criticism that it will simply be passed onto industry executives. Higgins listed the million-dollar salaries enjoyed by CEOs at health care giants like Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and United Healthcare.

It’s “morally reprehensible,” Higgins said.

Despite the fraught political circumstances, there was a moment of levity at the Energy and Commerce Committee.

Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, said she was going to blast the Republican plan using President Trump’s Twitter vernacular.

“Bad!” she said loudly. “Sad!”

Nov 09 2014,Healthcare.gov window-shopping opens tonight,Vox,left,http://www.vox.com/2014/11/9/7181649/healthcare-gov-window-shopping-opens-tonight,"1. Around 9 p.m. on Sunday evening, Health and Human Services employees flipped a switch and the new iteration of Healthcare.gov went live. While enrollment doesn't start until next Saturday (November 15), this new site now allows shoppers to start browsing plans in advance. It looks like this:

2. This is, arguably, the starting line for Obamacare's second year. This is when people are going to start poking around Healthcare.gov, getting a sense of what is available, what it costs, and whether they want to buy it. Open enrollment this year runs from November 15 through February 15. This is a much shorter time frame for people to buy health coverage than they had last year, when the first-ever sign up period started on October 1 and ended March 31.

3. Open enrollment 2015 will be easier than open enrollment 2014 in one big way: Healthcare.gov will likely be a functional website. When the website launched in 2014, it barely worked. Just six people managed to sign up the first day. Healthcare.gov didn't even have a window shopping option. Anybody who had even a slight interest in insurance coverage had to fill out a 76-screen application before ever seeing a price tag. The sign-up process became a giant bottleneck and Healthcare.gov cratered under the crush of shoppers trying to fill out applications.

there are two reasons this open enrollment will be harder than the last

4. All signs point toward the 2015 Healthcare.gov launch going smoother. The site can handle twice as much traffic as it did last year. Staff at Health and Human Services have successfully run demonstrations of the application and window shopping processes. They have shown, in real time, these parts of the website work — a huge boon to the law. Healthcare.gov is, essentially, a store to buy insurance. And this enrollment season, it seems like the store will open on time.

5. That's the upside for the Obama administration. But it's also easy to argue that this enrollment period will actually be harder for Obamacare for two main reasons.

people who really wanted a health plan already bought

6. This open enrollment season, the Obama administration is chasing customers who sat out the 2014 sign-up period — and trying to convince them, on the second go-around, that health insurance is worth the price. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that marketplace enrollment will rise to 13 million in 2015, a 5 million person leap from those who signed up in 2014. The Obama administration arguably got the low-hanging fruit in 2014; the people who really wanted coverage — maybe because they were sick, or more financially stable — bought it. This time around, the challenge is greater: getting people who decided last year that they were perfectly happy without insurance to change their minds.

7. Obamacare's second big challenge is re-enrollment: making sure the people who bought insurance last year do it again this year. One issue that consumer advocates I talk to worry about is that, last year, people shopped exclusively on price — and bought the cheapest, least-robust coverage. That could work against Obamacare: if shoppers didn't like the plan they had last year, they could decide against buying again this year. There's also a technical challenge here, too, as Healthcare.gov has never handled re-enrollments before. While HHS sources say they're confident it will work smoothly, it's still a new and untested process.

8. The prices being posted today matter a lot. Survey after survey of Obamacare shoppers have shown this information will be the most important part of decisions about whether or not to enroll.

""the test for affordability is how many people sign up next year""

While there are 8 million Americans who thought the health plans in Obamacare were a good deal, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates there are 20 million more who decided not to sign up. For many of them, the existing prices were too high; one survey found that 39 percent of shoppers who didn't buy coverage cited ""the costs aren't worth it"" as the reason.

""Eight million people clearly found it affordable, but there are millions more that didn't buy,"" says the Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt. ""The test for affordability is how many people enroll next year, and the year after."""

Nov 15 2022,"Amazon announces new virtual healthcare service to help with allergies, acne and hair loss",CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/15/amazon-clinic-to-provide-virtual-healthcare-for-allergies-acne-and-more.html,"Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, speaks at the ceremonial ribbon cutting prior to tomorrow's opening night for the NHL's newest hockey franchise the Seattle Kraken at the Climate Pledge Arena on October 22, 2021, in Seattle.

Amazon is expanding its healthcare offerings following its deal to buy One Medical, this time by opening a new virtual care option to help with common conditions like allergies, acne and hair loss.

Amazon Clinic, unveiled on Tuesday, will allow patients in 32 states to message clinicians through a secure portal to seek personalized treatments and prescriptions for common conditions. Patients can seek birth control options and care for urinary tract infections, dandruff, migraines and more.

The service does not yet accept insurance, but customers can use insurance to help pay for medications prescribed by a licensed clinician through the platform. The company said those prescriptions may be filled by any pharmacy but added that Amazon Pharmacy would also be an option.

To use the service, customers select the condition they're interested in speaking about and then choose a preferred provider. After completing a questionnaire, they'll connect with a clinician in a secure messaging portal to respond at the customer's convenience. Amazon said if a condition isn't suitable to be treated through the service, it will let customers know that before they connect with a provider.

Two weeks of follow-up messages are included with the cost of the initial consultation, which Amazon said in ""many cases"" would be equal to or less than the cost of the average copay. Customers can also use money from flexible spending accounts and healthcare spending accounts to pay for the service.

The new program comes just a few months after Amazon announced it was shutting down Amazon Care, a different telehealth service, by the end of the year. That program, which launched in 2019 as a pilot for employees, provided virtual urgent care and offered in-home visits from nurses for a fee to perform testing and vaccinations.

Amazon Health Services lead Neil Lindsay said in an email announcing the shutdown that Amazon Care was ""not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn't going to work long-term.""

Amazon's healthcare ventures have raised concern among some regulators and lawmakers about how it will use and protect sensitive information. The company said in its Amazon Clinic announcement that it has ""stringent customer privacy policies and comply with HIPAA and all other applicable laws and regulations.""

Oct 12 2014,Dallas Healthcare Worker Tests Positive for Ebola,Newsmax (News),right,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/US-Ebola-Dallas-Hospital/2014/10/12/id/600131/,"A ""breach of protocol"" at the hospital where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan was treated before his death led to the infection of a healthcare worker with the deadly virus, and other caregivers could potentially be exposed, federal health officials said Sunday.The hospital worker, a woman who was not identified by officials, wore protective gear while treating the Liberian patient, and she has been unable to point to how the breach might have occurred, said Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Duncan was the first person in the U.S. diagnosed with Ebola.

The CDC confirmed Sunday afternoon that the woman had tested positive for Ebola — the first known case of the disease being contracted or transmitted in the U.S.

The missteps with the first patient and now the infection of a caregiver raised questions about assurances given by U.S. health officials that any American hospital should be able to treat an Ebola patient and that the disease would be contained.

At a briefing in Atlanta, Frieden said that at some point during Duncan's treatment, ""there was a breach in protocol, and that breach in protocol resulted in this infection."" He added that officials were ""deeply concerned"" by the infection of the worker.

President Barack Obama asked the CDC to move as quickly as possible in investigating the incident, the White House said.

Dallas police stood guard outside her apartment complex and told people not to go inside. Officers also knocked on doors, made automated phone calls and passed out fliers to notify people within a four-block radius about the situation, although Dallas authorities assured residents the risk was confined to those who have had close contact with the two Ebola patients.

The worker wore a gown, gloves, mask and shield while she cared for Duncan during his second visit to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, said Dr. Daniel Varga of Texas Health Resources, which runs the hospital.

Duncan, who arrived in the U.S. from Liberia to visit family Sept. 20, first sought medical care for fever and abdominal pain Sept. 25. He told a nurse he had traveled from Africa, but he was sent home. He returned Sept. 28 and was placed in isolation because of suspected Ebola. He died Wednesday.

Liberia is one of the three West African countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic, which has killed more than 4,000 people, according to World Health Organization figures published Friday. The others are Sierra Leone and Guinea.

Texas health officials have been closely monitoring nearly 50 people who had or may have had close contact with Duncan in the days after he started showing symptoms but before he was diagnosed with the disease.

The healthcare worker reported a fever Friday night as part of a self-monitoring regimen required by the CDC, Varga said.

Another person who was described as a ""close contact"" of the health worker has been proactively placed in isolation, he added, without elaborating on where that person is being monitored. The hospital said its emergency department is diverting ambulances to other hospitals, though still accepting walk-in patients.

Frieden said officials are now evaluating and will monitor any workers who may have been exposed while Duncan was in the hospital.

Among the things the CDC will investigate is how the workers took off protective gear, because removing it incorrectly can lead to contamination. Investigators will also look at dialysis and intubation — the insertion of a breathing tube in a patient's airway. Both procedures have the potential to spread the virus.

""We knew a second case could be a reality, and we've been preparing for this possibility,"" said Dr. David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of State Health Services. ""We are broadening our team in Dallas and working with extreme diligence to prevent further spread.""

Healthcare workers treating Ebola patients are among the most vulnerable, even if wearing protective gear. A Spanish nurse assistant recently became the first healthcare worker infected outside West Africa during the ongoing outbreak. She helped care for two priests who were brought to a Madrid hospital and later died. More than 370 healthcare workers in West Africa have fallen ill or died since the epidemic began earlier this year.

In the health worker's neighborhood, one police officer said an industrial barrel outside contained hazardous waste taken from inside the building. Nearby residents periodically came out of their homes to ask about the commotion.

Kara Lutley, who lives a half-block from the complex, said she never received a call or other emergency notice and first heard about it on the news.

""I'm not overly concerned that I'll get Ebola,"" she said.

Officials said they also received information that there may be a pet in the healthcare worker's apartment, and they have a plan in place to care for the animal. They do not believe the pet has signs of having contracted Ebola. A dog belonging to the Spanish nurse was euthanized, drawing thousands of protests.

Ebola spreads through close contact with a symptomatic person's bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, vomit, feces, urine, saliva or semen. Those fluids must have an entry point, like a cut or scrape or someone touching the nose, mouth or eyes with contaminated hands, or being splashed. The World Health Organization says blood, feces and vomit are the most infectious fluids, while the virus is found in saliva mostly once patients are severely ill. The whole live virus has never been culled from sweat.

Duncan came to Dallas to visit his family.

The trip was the culmination of decades of effort, friends and family members said. But when Duncan arrived in Dallas, though he showed no symptoms, he had already been exposed to Ebola. His neighbors in Liberia believe Duncan become infected when he helped a pregnant neighbor who later died from it. It was unclear if he knew about her diagnosis before traveling.

On Saturday, customs and health officials began taking the temperatures of passengers arriving at New York's Kennedy International Airport from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in a stepped-up screening effort.

The screenings will expand to four additional airports — New Jersey's Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta — in the coming days."
Aug 02 2022,Senate passes veterans toxic exposure healthcare bill after contentious delay,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/senate-passes-pact-act,"The Senate passed veteran healthcare legislation Tuesday after a contentious delay brought about by a group of Republican senators blocking the bill over a budget measure.

The measure passed by a vote of 86-11, a bipartisan supermajority easily exceeding the 60-vote threshold to clear a filibuster. President Joe Biden hailed the passage of the “biggest expansion of benefits for service-connected health issues in 30 years and the largest single bill ever to comprehensively address exposure to burn pits” in a statement issued by the White House afterward.

CAN SENATE DEMOCRATS GET SINEMA ON BOARD FOR MANCHIN-BACKED SPENDING DEAL?

“I look forward to signing this bill, so that veterans and their families and caregivers impacted by toxic exposures finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they earned and deserve,” Biden added.

The bill, the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins Act, also known as the PACT Act, would expand eligibility for veterans who have been exposed to toxic chemicals for free medical care through the Department of Veterans Affairs. An estimated 3.5 million post-9/11 combat veterans may have been exposed to toxic chemicals or “burn pits,” according to the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee.

The substance of the bill has broad bipartisan support, and the Senate passed another version of the bill in June in an 84-14 vote. But the House made a technical change when it passed the bill, forcing the bill back to the Senate for final passage.

However, a group of Republican senators blocked the bill, arguing that a budget “gimmick” would designate $400 billion spent by Veterans Affairs as mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriations processes as discretionary spending. Last week, they blocked a procedural vote on the House-passed version of the bill. Democrats said the same language was used in the version of the bill that passed in June.

The move sparked public outcry from some veterans and activist groups as well as comedian and television personality Jon Stewart, who joined protesters at the Capitol.

At his weekly press conference on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said an agreement had been reached to pass the bill and hold votes on three amendments to it. The amendments were offered by Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Rand Paul (R-KY). Each amendment failed to pass.

“While we can never fully repay the enormous debt we owe to those who have worn the uniform, today, the United States Congress took important action to meet this sacred obligation,” Biden said."
Nov 16 2013,Obama facing Democratic dissent on healthcare law,Los Angeles Times,left,"http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-obama-dems-20131116,0,963245.story","WASHINGTON — President Obama’s botched rollout of his healthcare law has driven a wedge between the White House and its allies on Capitol Hill as more than three dozen House Democrats voted Friday to pass a Republican-backed change to the law that the administration warned would only make matters worse.

Unhappy with Obama’s inability to resolve the website enrollment problems and increasingly worried about the 2014 election, a small but steady number of Democratic lawmakers are distancing themselves from a president they once enthusiastically supported on the healthcare issue.

Friday’s House vote was the latest display of Democratic anxiety. Thirty-nine Democrats joined Republicans in a 261-157 vote to approve legislation, offered by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), that would allow insurers to continue selling individual policies that don’t meet new federal standards under the Affordable Care Act.

A similar Democratic revolt is underway in the Senate, pushing already rocky relations between Obama and congressional Democrats to a new low. Sen. Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana, among the most endangered Democrats up for reelection in the Senate next year, vowed to press forward with her bill to remedy the policy cancellation problem, which picked up support throughout the week.

The Democratic defections, which the White House and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) worked to limit, reflected dissatisfaction among the lawmakers with the administration’s proposed fix. That plan would give insurance companies federal permission to renew canceled policies for one year, but many lawmakers prefer a legislative fix.

Democratic leaders cornered wavering lawmakers in the House chamber on Friday after a tumultuous week that saw White House officials making repeated pilgrimages to Capitol Hill to tamp down discord.

“I’m just sending a message by my vote to my constituents back home that I’m going to take whatever action I can take as a member of Congress to fix the problems that have been created, unfortunately, in the law,” said Rep. Ron Barber (D-Ariz.), who voted in favor of the Upton bill. “It’s me being responsible to the people back home.”

In announcing his solution at a news conference Thursday, Obama acknowledged the political damage some Democrats were suffering because of their support for the law.

“There is no doubt that our failure to roll out the ACA smoothly has put a burden on Democrats, whether they’re running or not, because they stood up and supported this effort through thick and thin,” Obama said. “And I feel deeply responsible for making it harder for them rather than easier for them to continue to promote the core values that I think led them to support this thing in the first place.”

Facing a midterm election in which support for Obamacare will be used in Republican attacks, an insistent group of moderate Democrats is staking out a more independent path.

Many of these Democrats are freshmen, running for their first reelection, or veteran lawmakers who know what it takes to run a tough campaign in the few remaining politically mixed parts of the country.

Defections by House Democrats included not just lawmakers like Barber who represent swing or Republican-leaning districts. Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa), a candidate for an open Senate seat in his state next year, also voted for the bill.

“As much as anything, I see it as a trust issue,” said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), who voted Friday for the Republican plan.

Even though her two adult sons have benefited from the Obamacare provision that allows parents to keep their children on family policies until they are 26, Bustos said that after hearing concerns from constituents last week she had to act.

“In the end, you only have your word,” she said. “I had nothing to do with those initial votes, but I am associated with it now.”

Democratic leaders were pleased the tally was not more damaging for the president. The 39 votes for the GOP plan were on par with the results from other votes this year on Republican bills to undo Obamacare.

Both the Upton bill and the president’s administrative fix were crafted to respond to the millions of cancellation notices being sent to customers in the individual insurance market, despite repeated promises by Obama that Americans would be allowed to keep their plans if they wanted.

The GOP-controlled House was always expected to approve the bill, which Republicans described as the first step in a campaign to kill the Affordable Care Act.

It was unlikely that the Senate would pass a similar bill, and Obama has vowed to veto the measure if it reaches his desk.

“It will not fix that problem,” said House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who called the bill a “Trojan horse” to repeal the law. “What it will do is undermine the ability of millions and millions and millions of people to have health security.”

House Democrats offered an alternative proposal, similar to Landrieu’s Senate bill, that would allow individuals who had substandard plans to keep them for an additional year.

The open display of Democratic disunity has jolted a party that has been largely able to keep its internal divisions at bay in recent months as the civil war within the Republican Party grew.

The coattails of Obama’s first election in 2008 propelled eight Democratic senators into office. His reelection in 2012 brought a new class of 40 House Democrats.

But with the president’s approval rating at or near all-time lows in most public surveys, Democrats are increasingly searching for ways to inoculate themselves against “Obama fatigue” next year. The healthcare rollout debacle has provided a clear opportunity.

Yet many Democrats may find they have little choice but to stand with the president’s signature domestic policy achievement.

With the expected onslaught of anti-Obamacare ads coming in the midterm election campaign, Democrats will have difficulty divorcing themselves from the issue. And if Obama succeeds in resolving the problems, they don’t want to risk being seen as opponents of the law or critics of the administration.

Rep. Nick J. Rahall II (D-W.Va.) called the rollout “rotten.” But he, like other Democrats who voted against the president on this issue, nonetheless said he was committed to seeing that the law be properly implemented.

“I’m disgusted about it,” Rahall said, adding he thinks “heads should roll downtown, whoever was responsible” for the rollout problems. But, he said, “my goal is to fix it.”

Enrolling in HealthCare.gov is not easy, and it's been particularly difficult in Alaska. Just 53 people enrolled in the first month.

Anchorage hair stylist Lara Imler is one of the few who got through, as we previously reported. But Imler discovered problems with her application, and now she wants to cancel her enrollment.

""I don't even know how to feel about the whole thing anymore because I can't even get anyone who has an answer to help,"" she says. ""It's just such a lost cause at this point.""

A few things went wrong with Imler's HealthCare.gov application. First, according to the website, she successfully enrolled in a health plan. But her new insurance company, Moda Health, didn't have her application. When she called the HealthCare.gov hotline, no one could help her figure out what went wrong.

Then, she found out the website miscalculated her subsidy. She was supposed to receive a monthly subsidy of $366, but the website only let her use $315.

""The subsidy issue is weird,"" she says. ""If you look at my profile on the website it shows my full subsidy, but it says I'm only using part of it. So they know I've got a screwed up subsidy but they don't know what to do with it. There's no one directly you can talk to, to say, 'Hey my subsidy is on there. How do I apply for all of it?'""

It turns out everyone's subsidy in Alaska was miscalculated. Enroll Alaska discovered the error in mid-October and suspended enrollments.

It took two weeks for the federal Health and Human Services Department to resolve the issue. Since then, Enroll Alaska has signed up about 80 people in the marketplace. Chief Operating Officer Tyann Boling says half the people her insurance agents sit down with have tried to navigate HealthCare.gov on their own and given up.

""This is not an easy process. I think even if this website was functioning at 100 percent this would not be an easy process,"" Boling says. ""This is complicated. If you click on one wrong thing, there's no back buttons, it can be a really, really nasty process to go through.""

Boling is frustrated with the website, but not as frustrated as Imler. After weeks of trying — and failing — to make her application work, Imler wants a break from HealthCare.gov.

She never got a packet from her insurance company asking her to pay the first premium. She figures canceling the plan — with the chance to start fresh later — is her best option.

So on a recent morning, she sat down in her living room, with her laptop and a cup of coffee to try to resolve her difficulties—but not without frustration.

""I've had to change my password about four times. Oh, you know what, I have it written down. I cheated! There it is,"" she says.

The site logs Imler in pretty quickly. And after a few clicks she finds her enrollment information.

The application that she finished on Oct. 24 says ""Status, complete."" Imler clicks on the actual application and scrolls down to an ominous looking red icon that says ""Terminate Coverage.""

""So you hit the terminate button. It says you've chosen to end the following coverage... you then have to check 'I have fully read and understand that I'm choosing to terminate coverage,'"" she says. ""Then you click terminate again, and we'll see what happens.""

What happens is nothing. The health plan Imler signed up for is still listed in her profile. She logs out and then back in, and it looks exactly the same. She checks her e-mail for a notice of coverage termination and finds nothing there either. Imler leans back on the couch and looks surprisingly calm about the whole thing.

""I'm resigned to the fact that it doesn't work. No matter what I do, it just doesn't work. And this is the improved website.""

When she is able to cancel her plan, Imler says she won't be quitting HealthCare.gov for good. This is a separation, not a divorce. Imler's been uninsured for nearly a decade and wants that to change. She plans to log back into the website early next year and is hopeful that signing up for insurance will go a lot more smoothly then.

The idea is only one of several being discussed in a frantic effort to find a way around the technological problems that teams of experts are urgently trying to resolve.

So far, the administration has resisted the idea, partly because of concerns about giving insurance companies access to personal data. People familiar with the matter said no such modifications are planned, and even some insurers are not holding out much hope.

But senior White House officials said the administration was open to ways in which insurers could handle more enrollments and had stepped up efforts to make that possible because of the technical problems with the site."
Oct 22 2013,"HealthCare.gov: What works, what doesn't",CNN (Online News),left,http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/21/politics/obamacare-what-works/index.html?hpt=po_t1,"Story highlights A host of issues have plagued the launch of Obamacare's insurance exchanges President Obama says ""there's no sugarcoating it."" Problems include website error messages, faulty information, Internet overload Bright spots include state-run exchanges, clarity on services

Washington CNN —

The government-run health insurance exchanges have been open for business for 20 days. But a host of issues have plagued the highly anticipated launch, making it difficult for both consumers and insurance providers.

“There’s no sugarcoating it,” President Barack Obama said from the Rose Garden on Monday. “The problem has been that the website that’s supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody.”

What’s not working

Error messages: HealthCare.gov is plagued with technical problems. The Obama administration hasn’t completely released the cause or extent of the problems, likely because they haven’t quite figured them out.

But people in all but 14 states and the District of Columbia are having trouble applying for the exchanges because the website isn’t allowing them to complete the process.

“I put in my user name and password, it didn’t recognize it,” CNN’s Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen reported Monday, saying that the website gave her error messages or said “page not found” or that the system was down.

Obamacare open enrollment: Here’s everything you need to know

The problems appear to have been worse for those who signed up in the first days the exchanges opened.

Spinning icon: For others, the website is extremely slow. The spinning icon that indicates that the website is working, albeit slowly, is a huge frustration in the age of (relatively) fast connection speeds.

Faulty information: It’s not only consumers wanting to sign up for health insurance who are having trouble, but the insurance companies that provide coverage are experiencing difficulties with the exchanges, too.

Insurance companies say the technical problems are causing the companies to receive both incomplete customer information and duplicate applications.

Internet overload: The White House indicated that the problems are exacerbated because of the large number of people who have visited HealthCare.gov. Obama said 20 million have visited the site since the exchanges opened on October 1.

While the President said he would not excuse the problem, he said half a million people have managed to apply. But it is unclear how many of them have made it all the way through the sign up process.

While that’s a large number, it’s only a fraction of the 48 million uninsured and 20 million who have visited HealthCare.gov.

Still, as some have been able to sign up, it’s not all bad:

Have you had trouble signing up? Tell us your experience

What’s working

State-run exchanges: Fourteen states and the District of Columbia are running their own exchanges. Those websites are working much better.

Many of the states refused to implement their own exchanges in large part because of ideological opposition to the health care law, forcing the federal government to fill the void.

1-800-318-2596: That’s the number to call if you want to sign up for health insurance by phone; by speaking to an actual person. It works.

Obama said wait times are “less than a minute.” Cohen confirmed that receiving help via phone was a cinch.

“They’re terrific. They’re very helpful and they answer almost instantly,” she said of the call operators.

5 things that have happened since Obamacare launched

Navigators: Recent polls suggest that the majority of people don’t know much about the Affordable Care Act. A nonprofit set up to help people sign up for Obamcare, Enroll America, said they are seeing changes.

Justin Nisly, spokesman for Enroll America, said they have nearly doubled the number, from 4,000 to 7,000, working to educate the uninsured about the exchanges and health insurance.

Information: Before the exchanges opened, the cost and services provided were largely unknown. But both HealthCare.gov and the state-run exchange websites are providing detailed information about what people will get and how much it will cost.

Time: While the exchanges opened on October 1, coverage doesn’t begin until January 1, and the deadline for having coverage in place is March 1, so there’s still time to sign up. Officials are recommending people who need to sign up do so by February 15 to ensure the coverage will take effect in time."
Jan 12 2023,"U of M announces intent to gain full ownership of Twin Cities healthcare facilities, new medical center",CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/u-of-m-full-ownership-of-twin-cities-healthcare-facilities-new-medical-center,"MINNEAPOLIS -- The University of Minnesota announced Thursday its intent to gain full ownership of the existing healthcare facilities on its Twin Cities campus, currently owned by Fairview Health Services.

The university and its medical school announced its new ""MPact Health Care Innovation vision"" aimed to make Minnesota a leader in healthcare.

""With great inspiration from Minnesota and with insights from university researchers, faculty, physicians and health care professionals, the MPact Health Care Innovation vision is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to channel our unique ability to elevate our state, improve the lives of all Minnesotans and position Minnesota as a global leader for the next century,"" said President Joan Gabel.

As part of its vision, U of M also plans on constructing a new state-of-the-art medical center along the east bank of the Twin Cities campus.

""Seven of the top 10 hospitals in the U.S. are directly associated with a medical school because that's how you improve care quickly,"" said Jakub Tolar, dean of the U of M Medical School. ""We want these benefits for Minnesota and to serve Minnesotans in ways that only a hospital associated with a leading research university can.""

University of Minnesota leaders are calling for short-term and long-term partnerships from elected leaders to help fund the transition of ownership, as well as upgrading existing facilities and joining in the planning of a new medical center on the east bank of the Twin Cities campus.

To achieve their vision, Gabel says they need the state's help.

""We are calling on Attorney General Ellison and Governor Walz and the state legislature to support shifting these facilities to the university,"" said Gabel.

Myron Frans is the U of M Senior Vice President of Finance and Operations. He said they still want to honor their agreement with Fairview and said their partnership is important and works in many ways.

""Obviously there's some financial issues that Fairview is having from the operations, and we have to figure out how and why, and we want to be part of that discussion,"" said Frans.

In a statement, Fairview Health Services and Sanford Health said they were blindsided by the university's announcement.

""As we stated at this week's community meeting with Attorney General Ellison, we remain interested in a clinical partnership between the University and the combined Fairview/Sanford system. Since August, we have engaged in good faith with the University of Minnesota and brought forward many options for partnership. Despite repeated requests since August of last year, we have had no opportunity to meet with President Gabel or Regent Powell. ""In the interest of partnership, we put many options on the table, including the University repurchasing the East Bank academic medical center from the combined system. ""We look forward to working together with the University to better understand the details of their vision and determining fair market value for the assets they may seek. We also hope to learn more about their financial and operating plans in addition to the care partnerships necessary to support the University's teaching and academic missions. Our ultimate priority is supporting our staff and ensuring continuity of care for the patients we serve. ""We look forward to completing this merger and working with the University post-close. We are ready and willing to meet with President Gabel, Regent Powell, and other University leaders who are interested in working together to advance care for Minnesotans. We remain excited about what a combined Fairview/Sanford health system will bring to the Minnesotans we are proud to serve."" - Joint statement from Sanford Health and Fairview Health Services

""We need to be bold, we need to be ambitious and we need to be intentional on behalf of the state of Minnesota,"" said Tolar.

Tolar explained how hospitals offer better care when they're directly connected to medical schools and research centers.

""[We can] provide the best therapies today, the highest qualities, and the new ones for tomorrow, and you have to do it at the same time,"" said Tolar.

The U of M says they will also rely on state and community investments to upgrade the current university medical buildings and the new hospital they plan on building."

Republicans Won.,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2012/06/21/the_political_fight_on_healthcare_is_over__republicans_won,"That's the headline from the Washington Post's signature political blog, 'The Fix.' It's referring to the steadily deteriorating polling position of President Obama's signature ""accomplishment,"" in advance of the Supreme Court's hotly-anticipated verdict on its constitutionality. Here is WaPo's chart of its own Obamacare survey data over the last three years:

As you can see, opposition has consistenly outstripped support, but the anti-Obamacare position is pulling away. Contrary to Democrats' smug predictions, their law has become less popular as time wears on -- despite the fact that they designed the legislation to be front-loaded with popular provisions. A fresh poll from the Associated Press confirms this trend, demonstrating abysmally low support for Obamacare overall, and among independents:



Just a third of Americans back President Barack Obama's health care overhaul on which the Supreme Court is about to pass judgment, a new poll finds. But there is overwhelming support among both supporters and opponents for Congress and the president to begin work on a new bill if the high court strikes down the two-year-old law. The overall level of support for the law is relatively unchanged in recent months, with 47 percent opposing it. But an Associated Press-GfK poll shows that only 21 percent of independents approve of the law, a new low in AP-GfK polling.



But remember, the liberal establishment is warning us that the High Court could lose all credibility if it throws out all or most of a law that most Americans happen to despise. Meanwhile, with new economic indicators looking grim, Mitt Romney must remind voters that President Obama used his giant Democrat majority to pursue this unwanted healthcare law at the expense of jobs and the economy. Terrible policy, terrible priorities, terrible politics. Make them pay.



UPDATE - Avik Roy has more on Mitt Romney's plan to replace Obamacare, if and when the opportunity arises. James Capretta argues that conservatives should be equipped with proactive solutions on this front, regardless of how SCOTUS rules next week."

Apr 14 2021,Surveys Show Both Democrats and Republicans Support Healthcare Improvements,Hyria Stuart,left,,Text not found
Sep 13 2022,Just 12% of Americans Think the US Healthcare System Runs 'Very' or 'Extremely' Well,Common Dreams,left,https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/09/12/just-12-americans-think-us-healthcare-system-runs-very-or-extremely-well,"New survey data released Monday shows just 12% of Americans think healthcare in the United States is handled ""extremely"" or ""very"" well, further evidence of the deep unpopularity of a profit-driven system that has left roughly 30 million without insurance coverage and contributed to the country's stunning decline in life expectancy.

""In the richest country in the world, no one should die or go into debt just because they don't have access to healthcare.""

The new Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll finds that 56% of the U.S. public believe healthcare in general is handled ""not too well"" or ""not at all well,"" while 32% believe healthcare is handled ""somewhat well.""

In all, just 1 in 10 Americans feel the U.S. healthcare system as a whole and healthcare for older adults are handled well or extremely well.

""The poll reveals that public satisfaction with the U.S. healthcare system is remarkably low, with fewer than half of Americans saying it is generally handled well,"" AP notes. ""The poll shows an overwhelming majority of Americans, nearly 8 in 10, say they are at least moderately concerned about getting access to quality healthcare when they need it.""

The survey results will come as no surprise to those who have attempted to navigate the byzantine U.S. healthcare system to obtain basic care, which often comes at such prohibitively high costs that millions each year are forced to skip treatments to avoid financial ruin as insurance giants and pharmaceutical companies rake in huge profits.

The AP/NORC findings, based on interviews with 1,505 U.S. adults between July 28 and August 1, 2022, show that just 6% feel prescription drug costs are handled well or extremely well in the U.S., where pharmaceutical firms have broad authority to set prices as they please.

As for potential solutions to the country's longstanding healthcare crises, the new poll shows that ""about two-thirds of adults think it is the federal government's responsibility to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage, with adults ages 18 to 49 more likely than those over 50 to hold that view.""

""The percentage of people who believe healthcare coverage is a government responsibility has risen in recent years, ticking up from 57% in 2019 and 62% in 2017,"" AP notes.

More specifically, the survey shows 40% support for a ""single-payer healthcare system that would require Americans to get their health insurance from a government plan."" Depending on how the question is framed and phrased, single-payer--more commonly called Medicare for All--has polled as high as 70% support.

According to the AP-NORC survey, 58% ""say they favor a government health insurance plan that anyone can purchase""--a public option.

Recent research shows that a Medicare for All system of the kind proposed in new legislation introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) could have prevented hundreds of thousands of Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. over the past two years.

""In the richest country in the world, no one should die or go into debt just because they don't have access to healthcare,"" Jayapal, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, tweeted last week. ""We need Medicare for All now."""
Jul 09 2018,Trump Deals Another Blow to Obama's Healthcare Legacy,The Daily Caller,right,http://dailycaller.com/2018/07/08/obamacare-legacy-blow/,"The Trump administration announced Saturday evening that it is temporarily freezing billions of dollars of payments to health insurance companies intended to help them manage higher-risk patients, sparking backlash from the industry’s lobbying arm as insurers continue to struggle to adjust to the administration’s repeated attacks on Obamacare.

The federal government provides Obamacare insurers risk adjustment payments, which are supposed to cushion insurers from taking steep loses on high risk patients in the Obamacare marketplace. The government paid out over $10 billion in these in 2017.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service announced the abrupt halt of these payments Saturday evening, citing a February 2018 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico that invalidates them.

“We were disappointed by the court’s recent ruling,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. “As a result of this litigation, billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold. CMS has asked the court to reconsider its ruling, and hopes for a prompt resolution that allows CMS to prevent more adverse impacts on Americans who receive their insurance in the individual and small group markets.”

The insurance industry is already speaking out against the administration’s decision, calling it a crucial blow during a time when insurance companies are trying to come up with premiums and packages for 2019. (RELATED: Obama Gave Trump Some Laughable Advice About Obamacare)

“We are very discouraged by the new market disruption brought about by the decision to freeze risk adjustment payments. This decision comes at a critical time when insurance providers are developing premiums for 2019 and states are reviewing rates,” trade group America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said in a statement Saturday. “We encourage the Administration to reevaluate its decision and work with all stakeholders to make health care more affordable for all Americans..”

Insurers themselves are voicing concerns for market destabilization following the announcement.

“This action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices,” Blue Cross Blue Shield Association President and CEO Scott Serota said in a statement. “It will undermine Americans’ access to affordable coverage, particularly those who need medical care the most.”

Over the course of his first 18 months in office, the president has slowly targeted Obamacare with a series of moves intended to undermine the system and disrupt the marketplace. (RELATED: Trump’s Next Move To Knife Obamacare)

The president has rolled back funding for a program intended to help individuals navigate the insurance marketplace, Obamacare’s navigator program, signed an executive order to allow for groups to purchase insurance across state lines, stopped federal funding for Obamacare subsidies, pushed for consumer access to more affordable short-term, limited duration health insurance plans, cut Obamacare’s open enrollment period in half and its advertising budget 90 percent.

Trump made repealing and replacing Obamacare a key part of his successful bid for the presidency in 2016, but he has, thus far, been unable to materialize that goal.

House Republicans passed a bill — the American Health Care Act — in May 2017 after a few months of rocky negotiations that nearly stopped the effort in its track.

Senate Republicans had a more difficult time, given their 52- and subsequently slim 51-seat majority in the upper chamber. The Senate tried roughly a handful of times in 2017 to repeal and replace Obamacare, offering up a “skinny repeal” in July 2017 with no replacement as a last-ditch effort to overhaul the American health care system. That, too, failed to pass muster within the entirety of either the Republican or Democratic conferences.

Ultimately, Republicans and the White House have moved on from repealing and replacing Obamacare, although a coalition of outside conservative groups have hopes of reviving the debate in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made it clear he is ready to move on from the issue, but he has said he would entertain a proposal that was guaranteed to get enough votes to pass.

Jan 04 2017,Barack Obama and Mike Pence slated for healthcare showdown,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/04/barack-obama-mike-pence-us-healthcare-showdown,"Barack Obama and vice president-elect Mike Pence will have a showdown on Capitol Hill on Wednesday as the gloves come off in the fight over US healthcare.

The president will address House and Senate Democrats over how to counter Donald Trump’s stated objective of repealing the Affordable Care Act, a cornerstone of his legacy. Strategies are likely to focus on aspects of Obamacare that have bipartisan support as well as exploiting Republican divisions over how to replace it.

Pence, meanwhile, will address a meeting with House Republicans and attend a lunch with their Senate counterparts. A new, Republican-controlled Congress convened on Tuesday eager to repeal Obamacare after years of opposition.

Wednesday will mark a poignant, high-stakes return to Capitol Hill for Obama, who in 2009 delivered a landmark speech to the House for fundamental healthcare reform that had eluded presidents for decades. In a sign of the bitter wrangling to come, at one point he was interrupted by Republican Joe Wilson, who shouted: “You lie!”

The White House claims that, despite teething troubles, Obamacare has been a singular achievement. It brought health insurance to 22 million people and, for the first time in US history, means that more than 90% of Americans are insured.

Press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Tuesday: “I know that particularly at this time when there’s a lot of discussion about the president’s legacy, some people might think well, the president’s very concerned about political capital that he’s invested in this and doesn’t want to see it all go away.

“That’s certainly true, but the president’s priority and the president’s motivation is rooted in looking out for the interests of the 22 million Americans whose healthcare would be taken away if Republicans repeal the Affordable Care Act.”

Obama is concerned about a devastating impact on Medicare, which protects millions of elderly people, and Medicaid, a programme for low-income Americans, Earnest added.

He said: “It’s not surprising to me that there are some Republicans who are now a little queasy about the prospect of the impact that repealing Obamacare would have on their own supporters, on people in their own congressional districts, because we know there are people all across the country who benefit from this law, who are protected by this law, whose lives have been saved by this law, and the prospect of taking it away is a question of life or death for some people.”

Earnest suggested that Obama would encourage Democrats to focus on aspects of the Affordable Care Act that have bipartisan support. An obvious example is consumer protection that prevents employer discrimination against people with a pre-existing condition. “They should be out there telling the stories of their constituents who benefit from this law.”

During the election campaign, Trump vowed to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare although, after meeting the president, he indicated that some parts might be preserved. He nevertheless nominated a health secretary, Tom Price, who is an ardent critic of the law.

And this week Trump tweeted: “People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn’t work, and it is not affordable – 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it ‘CRAZY’” He added: “The Democrat Governor of Minnesota said ‘The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!’ – And, it is lousy healthcare.”

As promised, Republicans wasted no time getting down to business when the 115th Congress convened on Tuesday. Senate budget committee chairman Mike Enzi, a Republican from Wyoming, introduced a resolution that he touted as a “first step” toward repealing the president’s signature healthcare law.



The resolution includes “reconciliation instructions” that would enable Republicans to dismantle key provisions of the law with a simple 51-vote majority in the Senate. Using this budgetary maneuver, Republicans can undo enough of the law to render it functionally ineffective.



Addressing the Senate for the first time as minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of New York, said it was “not acceptable to repeal” the healthcare law and “throw our healthcare system into chaos and then leave the hard work for another day”.

In a statement, House speaker Paul Ryan applauded the resolution, saying it “sets the stage for repeal followed by a stable transition to a better healthcare system”.

He added: “Our goal is to ensure that patients will be in control of their healthcare and have greater access to quality, affordable coverage.”

However, unravelling Obamacare’s provisions, which offer tax credits for purchasing private health insurance and allow states to expand coverage of Medicaid, is complicated. It may be expedient to replace those provisions with other forms of healthcare coverage, but House and Senate Republicans are divided on how to go about it.

Some Republicans have conceded benefits from Obamacare, whereas others are fiercely opposed. Representative Steve King of Iowa said: “I’m for the complete, 100%, rip-out-by-the-roots repeal of Obamacare. I don’t want to leave any vestige of it behind, not one particle of its DNA in law.”

Trump has wavered on his campaign promise to “repeal and replace” Obamacare. In a meeting with Obama after his election, Trump indicated that he was open to parts of the law, especially the measures that bar insurance agencies from refusing to cover people with pre-existing conditions and allow young people to stay on their parents’ health insurance until they’re 26.



At Trump’s New Year’s Eve bash at his Mar-A-Lago estate in Florida, the president-elect thrilled the crowd when he said: “We’re going to get rid of Obamacare.”

A recent study by the Commonwealth Fund, which was analyzed by the Rand corporation, found that implementing Trump’s healthcare proposal would cause nearly 20 million people to lose insurance coverage in 2018. When people with no insurance are admitted to the hospital, the costs are often shifted to taxpayers.



On Tuesday morning, Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to Trump, said that the replacement process would be seamless. Asked if someone currently covered under the healthcare would have healthcare after it’s repealed, she replied: “That is correct.”



“We don’t want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance,” Conway said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. “Also we are very aware that the public likes coverage for pre-existing conditions. There are some pieces of merit in the current plan.”

Democrats are planning to launch an effort to mobilise grassroots support for Obamacare by explaining how its repeal would create a ripple effect hurting a majority of Americans."

“Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!” he said.

Can you believe that Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2017

The comments come after McConnell expressed his frustrations with the president for having “excessive expectations” for his agenda.

Speaking to the Florence Rotary Club in Kentucky earlier this week, McConnell said many of Trump's ""artificial deadlines"" are ""unrelated to reality,"" and suggested that was because he was unfamiliar with how Washington worked.

“Now our new president has of course not been in this line of work before. And I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,” McConnell said.

“And so, part of the reason I think people feel like we’re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality and the complexity of legislature may not have been fully understood.”

Trump responded directly to McConnell’s comments on Wednesday, tweeting, “Senator Mitch McConnell said I had ""excessive expectations,"" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?”

Jul 27 2017,Republican healthcare debate: what is a 'skinny repeal' of Obamacare?,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/27/us-healthcare-bill-obamacare-skinny-repeal,"It might sound like another trendy low-calorie caffeine drink promising all of the boost with none of the regrets.

But the skinny repeal is the fad sweeping the Senate Republican caucus as senators desperately try to find a way to advance their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

The pared-down plan has yet to be published but it would:

eliminate the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance or face a penalty

remove the employer mandate, the requirement that companies with 50 or more full-time employees must provide health insurance or pay a fine

and repeal the so-called cadillac tax, an excise tax on expensive insurance plans offered by employers that is due to go into effect in 2020.

It would not affect Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid, the government health program for low-income Americans, which some moderate Republicans want to keep.

Without a prepared text, the legislation has also not yet been analyzed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. This is a requirement if the bill is to pass through the special budget process known as reconciliation, which would mean it would only need a simple majority of 51 votes to get through.

But Democrats asked the budget agency to estimate the effect of the rumored amendment. The preliminary analysis on the yet-to-be-filed provisions found that it would leave 16 million fewer people insured over the next decade compared with current law and would raise premiums by roughly 20%.

The skinny repeal is the latest effort by Senate Republicans try to find some legislation that can achieve a majority. Fifty of the 52 Republicans in the Senate would need to vote for the legislation for it to pass, with vice-president Mike Pence breaking the tie.

As Senator John Thune of South Dakota told reporters: “Clearly, it has proven to be quite challenging to get 50 Republicans on board with one solution, but it’s been trying to move pieces around to try to get everyone comfortable and find a good landing spot. We just haven’t gotten there yet.”

“Come on Republican Senators, you can do it on Healthcare,” Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. “After 7 years, this is your chance to shine! Don’t let the American people down!”

While the skinny repeal could break the impasse among Republicans over how to repeal or replace the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, it is not without significant consequences.

Doctors, medical organizations and insurer groups have warned that the proposal would discourage healthy people from staying in the health insurance markets and could drive up costs, and could therefore lead to the eventual collapse of the Obamacare system.

“If there is no longer a requirement for everyone to purchase coverage, it is critical that any legislation include strong incentives for people to obtain health insurance and keep it year-round,” the BlueCross BlueShield Association, an insurer group, said in a letter. “A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone.”

But Republican senators have downplayed the criticism, arguing that the “skinny repeal” is just a vehicle to trigger a conference committee with the House, which passed a replacement plan in May. A conference committee is a bicameral committee of representatives and senators that meets to hammer out a bill that has been passed in different forms by each chamber. It produces a conference report, which is almost impossible to amend, for the House and Senate to approve.



“The so-called skinny provision is not a resolution of this problem,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee. “It only takes us to the next step, where hopefully we can find one.”

Activists opposed to Obamacare repeal have called the measure a “Trojan Horse”, noting that it could be replaced in conference by pieces of the failed Senate replacement plan or the House bill, which would weaken protections on sicker Americans. And while Senate Republicans insist the “skinny repeal” will not become law, there is a possibility, albeit an unlikely one, that the House could decide to forgo a conference and approve the measure, sending it to Trump who is waiting “pen in hand”.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of governors weighed in on a skinny repeal to urge against it.



“The Senate should also reject efforts to amend the bill into a ‘skinny repeal’, which is expected to accelerate health plans leaving the individual market, increase premiums, and result in fewer Americans having access to coverage,” said a letter signed by 10 governors, including the Republicans John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada.

But on Capitol Hill, several senators expressed a sense of the urgency to do something – anything – to keep momentum moving toward repealing the 2010 law.

“I think there’s a consensus that we need to produce some outcome. Is it going to be something that would be on my top three list of outcomes? I don’t know,” said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina. “It’s just moving the ball along because the problem doesn’t get solved if we fail to produce an outcome.”

Bill Cassidy of Louisiana shared his view, telling reporters he’d support anything that “moves the process forward” while Richard Burr of North Carolina more bluntly said: “Anything that gets conference, I’m happy.”

However, with the skinny repeal legislation still not yet written, senators from both parties expressed concern that they didn’t know what they would ultimately vote on.

The Maryland Democrat Ben Cardin took to the Senate floor to bemoan the fact that his staff couldn’t prepare amendments to protect Medicaid, because they didn’t know what the underlying language would be.

This was echoed by the Republican Mike Lee, of Utah, who proclaimed to reporters: “I don’t know what the skinny bill is. I haven’t seen it. I look forward to seeing and finding out what it is.”

Nearly 20 million people gained healthcare coverage under Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The law requires all Americans to have insurance or face a penalty, and offered states funding incentives to expand Medicaid coverage for people with low incomes.

A vote on the new legislation is expected early Friday morning.

Mar 14 2017,"Even If GOP Healthcare Bill Passes, It Is Destined to Fail",The American Spectator,right,https://spectator.org/even-if-gop-healthcare-bill-passes-it-is-destined-to-fail/,"American Spectator writer David Catron recently warned conservatives and libertarians about having unrealistic expectations about repealing Obamacare.

He listed the many good things that are in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s proposed “American Health Care Act” (AHCA) such as the repeal of both the individual and employer mandates and the elimination of Obamacare taxes. He then went on to criticize conservatives and libertarians, writing that they …

… are kvetching because of provisions like the 30% premium surcharge that the bill would allow insurers to charge patients who wait until they are ill to buy coverage. Countless commentators have conflated this with the individual mandate, but such comparisons are ridiculous. The individual mandate requires you to buy health insurance simply because you are alive, an outrageous assault on personal liberty. The GOP plan’s much-discussed premium surcharge is an incentive based on an individual’s choices. The former eliminates personal choice altogether. The latter incentivizes intelligent choices.

Catron concludes that critics are making “the perfect the enemy of the good.”

As much as I admire Catron, I think he’s wrong here.

Consider an analogy where the health care system is a patient and congressional Republicans are a physician. The patient has headaches, back pain and abdominal pains all of which are side effects of having cancer. The physician tells the patient that he will only treat the pain. When the patient complains, the physician replies, “You are making the perfect the enemy of the good.” The patient replies,” “No, you are treating the symptoms, not the disease.”

In the case of AHCA, the problem isn’t that it forces insurers to take people with pre-existing conditions as long as they pay a surcharge. It’s that, like Obamacare, it forces insurers to take people with pre-existing conditions, period. Obamacare took what had been known as the “individual health insurance market” and forced it onto the heavily regulated Potemkin markets called “exchanges.” The exchanges are now collapsing, and when that collapse runs its course, at best, a few insurers may remain on the exchanges. The AHCA, however, threatens to eliminate the individual insurance market entirely.

A stable “insurance pool” must have a sufficient number of young and healthy people to “cross-subsidize” the older and sicker. Under Obamacare, the young and healthy have an incentive to forego insurance on the exchanges because: (1) the regulations on the exchanges cause the price of insurance to be higher for young and healthy people — higher, that is, than what they would pay in a freer market; and (2) insurers must sell anyone a policy during the exchanges’ annual open enrollment period, even if the purchaser has a pre-existing condition. When not enough young people, generally ages 18 to 34, sign up for insurance, the “insurance pool” is heavily comprised of people who are older and sicker. This causes insurance prices to rise so that insurers can cover their costs. As premiums go up, even more young and healthy people drop out, prices increase again, and the process repeats itself. Eventually, many insurers lose money, causing them to leave the market. This results in less competition, which also causes premiums to rise. The term for this process is a “death spiral.” (For a good history on this, see the late Conrad Meier’s “Destroying Insurance Markets.”)

Obamacare tried to combat this with an individual mandate and premium subsidies. The individual mandate required everyone, including the young and healthy, to purchase insurance or pay a fine. Subsidies applied to premiums helped people pay for insurance on the exchanges and were based on income status. The lower a person’s income, the bigger the subsidy he would get. Since younger people tend to have lower incomes, presumably this would encourage enough of them to sign up on the exchanges.

Unfortunately, these were insufficient.

For the insurance pools on the exchanges to be stable, the Obama administration estimated that 38 percent of the sign-ups needed to be in the 18 to 34 age range. However, people in that age range never amounted to more than 28 percent of the people who participated in the exchanges. Recently Mark Bertolini, CEO of insurance giant Aetna, said the exchanges are in a “death spiral” and for good reason. Going into 2017, the average premium for policies on the exchanges increased a hefty 25 percent. Many of the major insurers — UnitedHealth, Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield, Humana — have either left most of the exchanges or are planning to next year. From 2016 to 2017, the number of people eligible for the exchanges who had access to only one insurer jumped from 2 percent to 17 percent.

AHCA takes the death spiral and kicks it into high gear.

First, in the year 2020, it replaces the premium subsidies with refundable tax credits based on age, with $2,000 for those up to age 29 and $2,500 for those ages 30 to 39. (For a full breakdown of the tax credits, see page 2 of this summary.) Right now, that’s probably more than most people ages 18 to 34 on exchanges receive in premium subsidies. But premium subsidies are based, in part, on the cost of premiums. If premiums keep rising by an average of 25 percent annually between now and 2020, it’s possible that the AHCA’s tax credits will be less than the premium subsidies. For now, though, let’s call that a wash.

Much worse, the AHCA replaces the short-term incentive to purchase an insurance policy with a long-term incentive to not buy one. If you don’t purchase insurance under Obamacare, then the Internal Revenue Service deducts a penalty from any tax rebate you might receive. The AHCA replaces that penalty with a 30 percent surcharge that insurers can charge anyone who has allowed their coverage to lapse for more than 63 days.

It appears that younger people didn’t care much about the individual mandate. Thus, if younger people don’t care about a tax penalty that occurs annually, why will they care about a 30 percent surcharge that they likely won’t face for decades? About 80 percent of health care expenses occur after the age of 40, so most 18-to-34-year-olds can put off worrying about that surcharge for quite some time.

Indeed, thanks to Speaker Paul Ryan and other congressional Republicans, it is much easier to determine the optimal time to purchase health coverage. Say that you are in your late 50s and have knee problems that are going to require a joint replacement. Let’s say that a policy on the individual market would normally cost about $10,000 annually. But, since you haven’t had insurance in a while, the insurance company will add the surcharge, costing you $13,000 annually. If the knee replacement costs about $15,000, then you are getting a pretty good deal. If you have a much more expensive illness like kidney failure, heart disease, or cancer, then that surcharge is a bargain! (And, to top it all off, insurers can only impose the surcharge for one year!) How likely is it that young people will be able to do such a calculation? Well, rumor has it they are a lot of smart whipper-snappers in Silicon Valley, and it probably won’t be long before one of them creates the Paul-Ryan-30-Percent-Surcharge App for your smart phone.

Finally, would insurers even offer coverage in the individual market under these conditions?

They are already dropping out of a market where the federal government is trying, albeit feebly, to provide incentives for people to purchase insurance before they get sick. Under the AHCA, people will have big incentives to avoid coverage until they are very sick. It’s hard to see how insurers make any money in that kind of market.

For insurance markets to work, people need to purchase insurance before they develop a serious illness, and the only way to make that work is to allow insurers to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. Certainly, any bill that replaces Obamacare will need to provide assistance to people with pre-existing conditions, especially those who have bought insurance on the exchanges.

That said, before the unveiling of the AHCA it had been difficult to see how the individual insurance market could be made any worse than it is under Obamacare. Speaker Ryan may have just done it.

May 20 2015,31M Left Underinsured by High Healthcare Costs: Report,Newsmax (News),right,http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/healthcare-insurance-deductibles-costs/2015/05/20/id/645630/,"Roughly one-quarter of people with health insurance are paying deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses that are so high they are considered underinsured, a new study has found.The 2014 national health insurance survey by the Commonwealth Fund estimates that 31 million insured people are not sufficiently protected against high healthcare costs, a figure that has doubled since 2003, The Hill reported.The report said that rising deductibles is the biggest problem for those considered underinsured, even with the advent of Obamacare.""The steady growth in the proliferation and size of deductibles threatens to increase underinsurance in the years ahead,"" the report warns, according to The Hill.The survey also found that people who purchase the lowest quality health coverage are also less likely to see a doctor when sick or injured because they fear high out-of-pocket costs.""People who have high deductibles do tend to skimp on healthcare,"" the study's lead author, Sara Collins, told reporters, according to The Hill.According to the report, half of underinsured adults and 41 percent of privately insured adults with deductibles of at least $1,000 had medical bills totaling $4,000 or more.The report casts doubt on the Obama administration's promise that millions of people would gain access to affordable healthcare under Obamacare. Nevertheless, the report does not take account of the people who were uninsured before 2014.""We're unable to separately assess the effects of the law with these data,"" Collins said, according to The Hill. ""What we're seeing, though, in the data is ever-growing deductibles.""Despite the increase in deductibles, healthcare costs overall have not risen as of late, something which the Obama administration has taken partial credit for, The Hill said.Specifically, the rate of those underinsured has flattened over the last several years, with the biggest increases in the underinsured population occurring between 2003 and 2010.The study found that those most likely to be underinsured are employed by small businesses, The Hill reported."
Mar 21 2015,HealthCare.gov still fixing tax-form blunder,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/mar/20/healthcaregov-still-fixing-tax-form-blunder/,"The administration said Friday it still had to send corrected tax forms to 80,000 of the 820,000 HealthCare.gov customers who received erroneous information from the federal Obamacare exchange earlier this year.

Marketplace CEO Kevin Counihan said the “overwhelming majority” of affected customers — 740,000 — had received amended forms that list the correct benchmark plan by which their Obamacare subsides are calculated. The rest of the forms will be in the mail next week.

The error was an embarrassing misstep for the administration, which had been celebrating a relatively hiccup-free signup season that stretched from mid-November to Feb. 15.

Administrative stumbles in the marketplace were inevitable, Mr. Counihan said Friday, and in this case, a flaw in computer code resulted in the incorrect forms.

“We have a responsibility to identify these issues quickly,” he told reporters. “It doesn’t matter if it impacts 800,000 consumers or one.”

Officials said anyone who does not receive a corrected form should contact the federal exchange, as the tax-filing deadline is less than 30 days away.

Filers who purchased subsidy health coverage on the Obamacare exchanges need the form, known as a 1095-A, to reconcile their tax credits with their actual income in 2014. A filer cannot do that accurately unless the form lists the correct benchmark plan — the second-lowest cost plan on an exchange’s silver tier.

Treasury Department officials have said the estimated 50,000 customers who filed their taxes before they received the correct forms do not have to refile or pay back any subsidy they were not entitled to.

Consumers who would have received money back from the IRS may file again.

This tax season marks the first time American taxpayers have to address their health care status on their returns. The vast majority of people will simply check a box to attest they have coverage through their employers or other means.

Employers are not reporting matching data to the government in this first go-round with Obamacare, so the administration must trust filers to be honest.

However, anyone who lies on the forms would be doing so under the penalty of perjury and could be exposed during an audit, said Mark Mazur, assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy.

Meanwhile, some filers will have to pay a tax penalty for lacking insurance in 2014.

The “individual mandate” tax for 2014 is the greater of $95 or 1 percent of household income above the filing threshold, a levy that rises to $325 or 2 percent of income in 2015.

Customers in the 37 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov portal can sign up for coverage until April 30 and avoid the 2015 fee if they owed a penalty for last year and realized their predicament after the Feb. 15 deadline to sign up on Obamacare’s exchanges.

Many of the exchanges run by 13 states and the District of Columbia have offered similar grace periods to penalty payers.

The federal website serves residents of 37 states. Florida leads the way in 2015 plan selections, chalking up more than 1.3 million sign-ups compared to about 969,000 in Texas and roughly 480,000 in third-place North Carolina.

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale area ranked first among metro areas, with 637,514 sign-ups from Nov. 15 to Jan. 30.

The Atlanta, Dallas and Houston areas each tallied 250,000-300,000 sign-ups.

The Health and Human Services Department said it reviewed metro areas that have at least 725,000 residents and at least one county in a state that uses the federal exchange.

The Minneapolis-St. Paul- Bloomington region, which spans both Minnesota’s state-run exchange and Wisconsin, which uses the federal website, tallied the fewest sign-ups among metropolitan areas, with 3,675, according to HHS data.

HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell previewed the data during budget testimony Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee. She said that besides HealthCare.gov customers, 2.4 million people have signed up on the portals run by 13 states and Washington, D.C.

However, Mrs. Burwell did not say whether her agency is working on a backup plan in case the Supreme Court strikes down the government subsidies that flow to nearly nine out of every 10 customers on the federal exchange.

The justices are set to rule by June on a lawsuit, King v. Burwell, which claims the Affordable Care Act restricted the subsidies to customers on the state-run exchanges.

Administration officials say Congress intended to treat every state the same and that an adverse ruling would make coverage unaffordable for millions of low- to moderate-income Americans.

""In today's marketplace, [insurers] are competing for business,"" she said in a statement. ""Returning customers may find an even better deal if they shop and save.""Consumers keeping the most popular plan will face at least a 5 percent rate hike in the 35 states where the federal government runs the health insurance exchanges, the department said.However, the report added that about 70 percent of insurance customers enrolled in an Obamacare program could find lower-cost policies by shopping around on HealthCare.gov.About 90 percent of consumers will have a choice of three or more insurance companies offering multiple plans, the report said.Regardless of the assurances of affordability, Obamacare remains unpopular among a majority of Americans.

Nov 11 2013,Worrying signs for Obamacare: Plan B needed for Healthcare.gov,Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/11/worrying_signs_for_obamacare_plan_b_needed_for_healthcare_gov/,"From a political communications perspective, the purpose of President Obama's interview with NBC's Chuck Todd last week was to apologize to anybody who had been misled by his promise that everyone would be able to keep their existing insurance policies.

And a nationally televised apology from a president to the public happens so rarely, and is such a strong statement of political vulnerability, that it predictably commanded the lion's share of attention from the rest of the media.

But for my money the newsiest moment wasn't the apology. It was this not-so-stirring assessment of the progress the administration has made in its ongoing effort to fix Healthcare.gov.

""I'm confident that it will be even better by November 30 and that the majority of people are going to be able to get on there,"" Obama said. ""They're going to be able to enroll. They're going to be able to apply. And they're going to get a good deal -- a better deal than they've got right now when it comes to buying health insurance.

""Now that -- you know, having said that, given that I've been burned already with a website,"" here he checked himself, ""well, more importantly, the American people have been burned by a website that has been dysfunctional. What we've also been doing is creating a whole other set of tracks. Making sure that people can apply by phone effectively. Making sure that people can apply in person effectively. So what I'm confident about is that anybody who wants to buy health insurance through the marketplace, they are going to be able to buy it.""

Then on Thursday the administration offered up the following progress report.

""Essentially what is happening is people are going through the entire process,"" a spokeswoman for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services told reporters on a conference call. ""As we have fixed certain pieces of functionality, like the account creation process, we're seeing volume go further down the application. We're identifying new issues that we need to be in a position to troubleshoot.""

I'm no tech expert, but when I read that, I imagined plumbers working a clogged pipe with no way to visualize how many constrictions need to be cleared. Each blockage hides another a few inches deeper into the system. Or to put it in terms the administration might use, when they punch an item off the list they have to add another item to it. One step forward, one step back.

The administration's official line remains that it's confident Healthcare.gov will be working for the vast majority of users by the end of the month. But its detailed assessments make that harder and harder to believe. Insurance industry officials don't share the administration's confidence. And Republicans in Congress don't just smell blood -- they're lapping it up like vampiric dogs.

So the administration needs backup plans: One to get the law chugging along somehow without accessible marketplaces in most states, and one to manage the political fallout of a non-functioning federal exchange, which will be horrendous.

Robert Laszewski, an industry consultant who's been writing about Healthcare.gov's failures for the past six weeks, posits some policy options here. These include encouraging people to enroll directly with the insurance companies participating in the exchanges. Even if it means asking working- and middle-class people to pay sticker price premiums for as long as it takes to get the subsidy system up and running, with the understanding that overpayments will be refunded to them by the IRS.

The political problem is almost as intractable, and in many ways could interfere with key policy imperatives.

This week, Republicans will put legislation on the House floor that would essentially require insurance companies to allow people to keep their recently canceled plans for another year -- the Keep Your Health Plan Act -- and exempt the policyholders from the mandate penalty. The bill has little policy merit. It would significantly limit the scale of the exchanges, perhaps enough to deny them the critical mass they'll need to effectively spread risk, and it would be difficult if not impossible to implement from an industry perspective. But it's on the right side of public opinion and it's largely intended to fracture the pro-Obamacare coalition. If it ever clears the Senate, Obama would quite possibly have to veto it.

A working website would limit the political consequences the canceled plans are causing, but it's in many ways a distinct problem. Republicans would be using the cancellations as impetus to undermine the law even if Healthcare.gov were functioning as well as Amazon. The administration is looking for an administrative remedy for cancellation letter recipients, but there's no obvious solution that wouldn't require congressional action, and Republicans would block congressional action -- such as extending subsidies -- that actually addresses the problem without undermining the law. In other words, Obama is facing a political nightmare, and we're not even at the point of contemplating the damage Republicans will inflict if the site isn't working by the end of the month.

Democrats in Congress will then face increasing pressure to agree to a GOP plan to delay the individual mandate penalty for a year -- an approach intended to use Healthcare.gov's collapse to pull the rug out from underneath well-functioning markets in states with their own exchanges.

The administration may have the authority it needs to circumvent Congress here -- extend the open enrollment period and provide hardship exemptions from the penalty to people in states without functioning marketplaces. But it would have to be prepared to admit failure first.

Now obviously Obama shouldn't contemplate doing any of this if the site really will be working by the end of the month. But if and when it becomes clear to administration officials that it won't be ready, they'll need to announce the failure and the workaround more or less simultaneously. The absence of a plan B would create a vacuum for congressional saboteurs, and Democrats would probably get sucked into it. Opposing all proposed solutions won't be sustainable. And at that point Obama would have to entertain the prospect of allowing Republicans to inflict lasting damage upon his signature achievement."

WASHINGTON -- Top congressional Democrats on Sunday stood by President Obama and the flawed rollout of the government’s healthcare website, expressing confidence the problems would be fixed and the issue would not drag down the party in next year’s mid-term elections.

“I don’t think you can tell what will happen next year, but I will tell you this -- Democrats stand tall in support of the Affordable Care Act,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Pelosi downplayed the defection of 39 House Democrats on Friday who voted to help pass a Republican bill, opposed by the White House, to address the millions of people facing cancellation of their health insurance policies. The bill, which passed 261-157, would allow insurers to continue selling individual policies that do not meet new federal standards under the law.

The number of Democrats who defied President Obama and House Democratic leaders on the vote was about the same as those who have joined with Republicans on other bills to alter the healthcare law, Pelosi said. On one such vote in July, to delay the employer mandate in the law, 35 Democrats joined with Republicans.

PHOTOS: 2013’s memorable political moments

Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the assistant House Democratic leader, said many of his colleagues who voted for the Republican bill Friday did so to protect themselves politically.

“Maybe nine people had real serious concerns,” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union. “The fact of the matter is, about 30 of them, and I’ve talked to them, were insulating themselves against sound bites.”

Clyburn criticized the legislation because it would allow insurers to continue to sell what he called “substandard” and “junk” policies.

But Republicans said Democrats were trying to gloss over the problems with the controversial law.

“No matter how much Congresswoman Pelosi tries to spin this, this is a mess,” Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) said on “Meet the Press.” “My constituents are very unhappy with the notices they’re receiving and higher premiums.”

Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) said the law needed to be scrapped.

“It’s time to start over. This healthcare law is terribly flawed,” he said on CNN. “The president did not need to destroy a good healthcare system to try to make a better one.”

Obama tried to address the problem of policy cancellations last week even as administration officials scrambled to try to get the healthcare.gov website running correctly by the end of the month. On Thursday, Obama gave insurance companies permission to renew policies that were to be canceled for not meeting the law’s new standards that require, for example, coverage for prescription drugs, hospitalization and maternity care.

But companies do not have to renew the policies and would need permission from state regulators to do so.

“Keep in mind, it is a suggestion. It is not a ruling, and it certainly is not a law,” Ben Nelson, chief executive of the National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, said on “Fox News Sunday.” A former Democratic senator, Nelson said insurance commissioners are concerned Obama’s proposal could disrupt the healthcare market and lead to higher premiums.

Insurance industry officials have the same concerns. They met with Obama at the White House on Friday and are working with the administration to try to address the issue of policy cancellations, said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group.

“We have the same goals. We’re going to work together to try to get people into affordable coverage,” she said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We have work to do, there is no question. But we have an interest in doing it together and working together on that.”

Oct 30 2013,Obamacare fiasco: Was building HealthCare.gov really that hard?,Christian Science Monitor,center,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/2013/1030/Obamacare-fiasco-Was-building-HealthCare.gov-really-that-hard,"Technical glitches on the website to sign up for insurance under the Affordable Care Act have elicited no small amount of finger-pointing. But how tough a task is it to build an online portal like HealthCare.gov?

On the surface, it may look like just another shopping site. But tech analysts say it is a daunting mix of public and private databases combined with a nearly unprecedented demand for real-time secure information – all launched in the glare of national politics.

“What makes so much of this unique is the need for real-time validation for so much data,” says Edward Holden, associate professor of technology at Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.

For instance, the need for income verification “means they have to access antiquated systems over at the Internal Revenue Service, and they want it all to be done in real time,” says Professor Holden.

Most companies faced with such a demand would take the information and do the verification process off-line and get back in followup communications.

“What makes this extremely challenging is they are going into data systems that are not designed to be this responsive nor have the capacity to provide this kind of information quickly,” he says.

The big challenge for HealthCare.gov is pulling in all of those sources of data for hundreds of millions of people and layering it in a way that is flexible and manageable, says Sid Probstein, chief technology officer at Attivio, a software company in Newton, Mass., that specializes in ""big data"" management. “A project of this scale with huge data silos using legacy technology, will undoubtedly come with issues,” he adds in an e-mail.

Many large corporations launching sites on a similar scale have had certain advantages, says Mr. Probstein. “They can beta test, start small, reengineer, and work up to the massive size of HealthCare.gov,” he adds.

Inefficiency is one of the site’s biggest challenges, says Michael Smith, engineering vice president at Compuware APM, which has conducted a technical analysis of the HealthCare.gov site. This is predictable given the diversity of information sources – from individual states to the IRS to dozens of private insurers – and the fact that the site must work with nearly 50 different subcontractors to pull together its web of data, he says.

The site includes multiple versions of overlapping monitoring software, Mr. Smith notes. These programs track users' keystrokes and help the site deliver faster service based on the way clients actually use it. But HealthCare.gov has no fewer than five such programs, including Google Analytics, Chartbeat, and Pingdom, and they all do similar monitoring and feedback.

That suggests that each contractor built its own monitoring service into its calculations, he says. On one hand, that's “a good thing, because the monitoring helps them improve services."" But, he adds, “the overall site could easily reduce that to one service.”

Each service requires the site to connect and provide information, creating an unnecessary drag on performance.

Many critics note that the site short-changed testing that might have picked out these flaws. But testing is no easy thing, says David Miller, chief security officer for Covisint, which specializes in ""cloud""-based information management, who has testified before the US Senate on similar technology.

Say that a site has 16 ""yes"" or ""no"" questions. Answers to those questions produce some 65,000 pathways, “all of which have to be tested ... not just the 3,000 logical answers, because people are not always logical when they answer questions,” Mr. Miller says.

So why doesn't an enormously complex website like Amazon have such technical problems?

“Amazon has had 10 years to slowly build out its operations,” says Zach Nies, chief technologist for Rally Software, a software analysis firm.

The key to constructing a massive site is to tackle small sections at a time, test them, and build on the lessons of each small segment, he says.

Along those lines, HealthCare.gov is improving daily, Smith says. Compuware has been tracking the site since the firm conducted its Oct. 21 analysis. As of last week, 26 states had average wait times of more than eight seconds, which he deems “unacceptable.” As of Oct. 29, that number had dropped to 15."

The poll, released Tuesday, finds that 68 percent of voters are concerned about their health care under the new system. That includes 43 percent “very” concerned and another 25 percent “somewhat” concerned.



The number feeling concerned is more than twice that of those who are unworried (31 percent).



Even a 56-percent majority of Democrats feels concerned (31 percent “very” concerned). By comparison, 72 percent of independents and 77 percent of Republicans feel that way.



The poll also finds a 54-percent majority wants to go back to the health care system that was in place in 2009. About a third -- 35 percent -- thinks it would be better to leave the new law in place.



A new Fox News poll shows an overwhelming majority of Americans are concerned about their healthcare plan under Obamacare while a majority want to go back to the 2009 healthcare system. Concerns are not only shared among Republicans and Independents, but by aThe Obama administration has been frantically trying to get young people onto Obamacare exchanges in order to prevent a collapse of the legislation but a majority of young people, 60 percent, are skeptical and worry about what will happen to their healthcare under the new system.

Monday, a new USA Today/Pew Research Center poll showed a majority disapprove of President Obama's handling of healthcare despite Obamacare being his signature piece of legislation.









The Obamacare exchanges for individuals go into effect in two weeks.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight At the University of Michigan, students and faculty members are protesting the school’s use of Accenture to help cut costs, citing a report by a committee of alumni and graduate students that said the firm has “a disturbing pattern of problematic past performance.” In North Carolina, glitches in an Accenture-configured computer system contributed to massive backlogs for food-stamp recipients, leading the Obama administration last month to threaten to withdraw the state’s food-stamp funding.

Federal officials have also on occasion criticized the company's integrity. The U.S. Postal Service Inspector General's Office wrote in June that Accenture had ""demonstrated an absence of business ethics"" and said that the agency should consider terminating the firm's more than $200 million in contracts. The office cited in part a 2011 settlement with the Justice Department in which Accenture paid $63 million to resolve alle­gations of what the government called ""kickbacks"" and ""bid-

rigging"" in numerous federal contracts. The company denied wrongdoing in the case.

The Obama administration decided last month to select Accenture for the Affordable Care Act contract, perhaps the firm's

highest-profile job yet. Although the Web site has improved since its disastrous Oct. 1 launch, federal officials concluded that the previous contractor, CGI Federal, had not been effective enough in fixing the intricate computer system that underpins it, according to government documents and interviews.

Administration officials say that Accenture is uniquely qualified for the estimated $91 million, one-year contract because of its breadth of resources and experience in building major online systems for federal agencies such as the Census Bureau and the Education Department. The officials also cited the firm’s work on the California health-insurance marketplace, which has enrolled large numbers of residents in health plans despite suffering technical glitches.

An office built with the millennial worker in mind + 9 With its office in Arlington, Accenture wanted to reflect what it was consistently hearing from 20-something workers. The result is a space with a heavy emphasis on flexibility, mobility and connectivity.

“Accenture was selected to help us maintain the site’s high performance and make important enhancements as we prepare for next year’s open-enrollment period,’’ said Tasha Bradley, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

Accenture, which is based in Ireland and operates throughout the United States, is a consulting and technology powerhouse with $28 billion in annual revenue. It works with more than three-

quarters of Fortune 500 companies, maintains a thriving U.S. government practice and has a generally solid reputation, analysts and IT experts say.

Accenture officials defended their past performance and commitment to ethics, pointing out that the firm has received strong ratings from industry analysts. In the United States alone, they said, the company has successfully worked on more than 1,000 federal, state and local projects in the past year.

“Accenture is known for taking on the most complex and ­mission-critical assignments and getting the job done,’’ said Jim Mc­Avoy, a company spokesman. “We have long-term relationships with the world’s leading companies and our clients value our capabilities and our track record, and the quality of our work has been recognized.”

The firm’s federal subsidiary, Accenture Federal Services, was chosen by CMS over three other companies for HealthCare.gov in what one CMS document described as an “abbreviated” process. A CMS official said that the agency did a thorough analysis of Accenture’s record.

“Past performance was a key criteria when evaluating Accenture’s potential to serve as the new contractor,’’ said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal decision making.

But during the past decade, nearly 30 Accenture projects in the United States and abroad have encountered problems, including technical malfunctions and cost overruns, according to interviews, media accounts, government audits and other records.

Accenture officials declined to answer questions about specific projects the company has previously performed.

“There is nobody in the government-contracting space with an unblemished record,’’ said Steven L. Schooner, a former senior federal procurement official who co-directs the government procurement law program at George Washington University. “You assume everyone comes with baggage. The fundamental issue is, I hope the government did sufficient research to find out who the most qualified firms were and to weigh the positives and negatives.’’

John Belden, a senior executive at UpperEdge, a Boston firm that advises companies on major IT projects, agreed that Accenture is “at the top of the stack” in the IT industry.

But, he said, Accenture is at a disadvantage on a project as politically sensitive as HealthCare.gov, because the company lacks experience in federal health care. Less than half of 1 percent of Accenture’s $10 billion in U.S. federal contracts since 2000 have involved CMS, according to data compiled by USAspending.gov.

“Understanding those systems rapidly — that’s going to be an issue,’’ Belden said.

Company officials said the firm has substantial experience with health-care projects at the state and local levels.

Arthur Andersen roots

Accenture is descended from the onetime venerable accounting firm Arthur Andersen. In 1989, a group of Andersen partners resigned to form Andersen Consulting, which was legally separate but under the same umbrella organization.

In 2001, Andersen Consulting changed its name to Accenture. Arthur Andersen went out of business the following year because of its role in the Enron accounting scandal; Accenture had no role in that scandal.

By then, Accenture was an industry giant and experiencing problems with some of its projects.

Between 2004 and 2007, the Pentagon and four states canceled Accenture contracts to develop online voting or voter-

registration systems, citing problems such as software flaws and inadequate computer security. At the time, Accenture defended its work on the projects, and in some instances blamed state officials or workers for the difficulties.

In Texas, state officials encountered difficulties with an Accenture contract to operate call centers to process social-service benefits applications. The system led to ""massive delays"" in access to food stamps and health care for hundreds of thousands of low-

income residents, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Texas-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.

In the District, an Accenture-developed city tax office computer system often incorrectly calculated penalties and interest for tax bills, according to a 2006 report by the Wendell Group, an outside IT firm. “Accenture has provided a poorly designed tax accounting system and mismanaged this poor design,” said the report, which also blamed District officials for poor oversight.

Accenture’s occasional problems also extended to the federal level. A 2007 report by the Interior Department’s inspector general blasted the firm’s work on a computer system for the Minerals Management Service, which regulated the oil industry. One accountant told auditors that the system took 15 times as long as the one it replaced.

The inspector general at the time, Earl Devaney, recalled in an interview that he “could not understand why Accenture had not been thrown out the door. Millions of dollars, and they still hadn’t gotten this up and running after all that time.’’

‘Probably the best choice’

Some experts in federal contracting warn that Accenture’s record is worrisome, while others say there is no better firm to take on the troubles of HealthCare.gov.

Daniel I. Gordon, who headed government procurement policy earlier in the Obama administration and is now associate dean for government procurement law studies at George Washington University, said: ""There is a real concern. This company has problems in their past performance that are relevant and recent. . . . The real question is whether the government did its due diligence.''

In contrast, Larry Allen, president of McLean-based Allen Federal Business Partners and a 24-year federal IT professional, called Accenture “a very solid firm” and said that all major contractors have some problems, because large IT projects are so complex.

“I think their error rate is pretty consistent with other large firms,’’ Allen said. “Does that excuse things they did wrong? No, but it does put it into context.’’"

As if the rollout of the federal health law didn't have enough problems, abortion is back in the spotlight.

How the various health plans in the exchanges would or would not pay for abortion was one of the very last issues settled before the bill was passed in 2010. Now abortion's invisibility on the federal HealthCare.gov website has some people pretty upset.

The issue came up Wednesday when Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified on Capitol Hill.

""If someone, a constituent of mine or someone in this country has strongly held pro-life views, can you commit to us to make sure that the federal exchanges that offer that is clearly identified and so people can understand if they're going to buy a policy that has abortion coverage or not?"" asked Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. ""Because right now, you cannot make that determination.""

Sebelius appeared to be caught off guard by the question.

""I don't know,"" Sebelius replied. ""I know exactly the issue you're talking about — I will check and make sure that is clearly identifiable.""

At least for now, though, it's not clearly identifiable, those on both sides of the abortion debate agree.

""The exchanges, by law, have a complicated scheme of including at least one plan that does not include elective abortion,"" says Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion think tank.

That was part of the deal that got the law passed, so that abortion opponents could avoid policies that cover the procedure. But he says that not only is the information not on the website, sometimes it's not easily available by calling, either.

""We did what we were recommended to do, and that is call the individual insurers,"" he said. ""And in many cases they don't have plan documents in front of them as they talk to you on the phone.""

It should be noted that in 23 states there is little question. Those states have passed laws that ban all plans in their health exchange from offering coverage for elective abortion. Eight of those states have also banned private insurers outside the exchange from offering coverage for abortion as well. Most, but not all, include exceptions for life endangerment, rape or incest. Some of those states allow abortion coverage to be sold as a separate policy, called a rider, but so far there's no evidence that any plan is offering that.

Judy Waxman of the National Women's Law Center says this is a major change from what has traditionally been the status quo for abortion coverage in private health plans.

""Abortion has generally been covered because it is treated like any other medical service and is just part of outpatient care or doctor care, and really has not been singled out very much in private insurance,"" she says.

But the fight over the Affordable Care Act changed that. In order to ensure that no taxpayer money went to pay for elective abortions, it created a very complex system by which insurance companies would have to separate out a portion of each premium if they wanted to continue to offer abortion as a covered benefit.

Waxman says, as a result, there is at least anecdotal evidence that some insurers are dropping coverage, at least for this first year, just because of the added hassle.

""We had heard that some plans are saying that they are not going to offer it now because they have so much to figure out, and this little extra administrative activity they have to be involved in is something they want to figure out when things calm down a little,"" she says.

But it's the anti-abortion community that remains most upset. Anti-abortion lawmakers in Congress, led by Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., have introduced legislation that would require information about abortion coverage to be available directly on health exchange websites.

Donovan says it will help those on both sides of the debate.

""It's designed so that people have information about elective abortion coverage whether they're looking for it or they're looking to exclude it,"" he says. ""They would have that information when they have their encounter with the plan and not have the information only after they bought it.""

Abortion-rights supporters oppose the bill. ""It is intended to discourage plans from covering abortion and maybe even go as far to say it is to discourage women from taking that plan and trying to put a stigma on the plan or the individual,"" says Waxman.

But for now, at least in states where coverage is allowed, whether or not abortion is a plan benefit remains largely a mystery."

Story highlights The new insurance exchange site, HealthCare.gov, has technical problems Steven Bellovin: Large-scale software projects are hard; glitches are common He says testing for errors and changing requirements contribute to delays or failures Bellovin: Good project management is a remarkably large part of the effort

CNN —

No one should be surprised by the technical problems that have plagued the new health insurance exchange website, HealthCare.gov, which allows millions of Americans to sign up and buy health coverage.

Angry, OK. Disappointed, of course. But surprised? Don’t be.

Large-scale software projects are hard. Failures or delays in schedule, budget and functionality are so common as to almost be the norm, not the exception.

Steven Bellovin Eileen Barroso

Sure, the website rollout could have been handled a lot better. With all the delays and warning signs, the government could have stopped touting HealthCare.gov and teasing the public with messages such as “5 days to open enrollment. Don’t wait another minute.”

But the federal government has never had a fantastic track record in dealing with technology projects. This was not just an Obamacare problem. Most of the government has little experience in managing such a big, complex project, and management is a remarkably large part of the effort; building a system like this takes far more than just programming.

Maybe it should have hired a general contractor to supervise the 55 contractors who worked on the website. Maybe it should have looked into launching at a later date instead of October 1. But the bottom line is that technical glitches are an inescapable part of our digital life.

We see this in the private sector. When United Airlines and Continental Airlines merged, the combined reservation system didn’t work very well at first. The new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport outside London was saddled with software problems. Nor are tech giants immune; Windows Vista was very late because Microsoft had myriad troubles during development.

The inherent nature of software is that it demands perfection. Computers do exactly what they’re told to do. Even small errors can be disastrous. For example, one of the first American space probes to Venus was lost in part because of a single missing hyphen character in a program.

Testing is the next hurdle. Any project needs adequate time to make sure the software works properly and to find and correct any flaws. Time, however, was in short supply with the launch of the online insurance marketplace. If development took too long, there wouldn’t be enough time to test it thoroughly. That apparently was one of the problems. And even when all of the pieces are working fine, the entire system has to be tested; that can’t be done until quite late in the process.

Project management also plays a big role. It’s very hard to estimate how long a project will take. That means it’s hard to know how many programmers to devote to the task, how much it will cost and so on. Measuring progress isn’t easy, either, which means it’s hard to tell how far along you are.

The worst problem is probably that requirements change while the software is being developed. This may mean that you have to redo work you’ve already done, but the effects can be more far-reaching. It’s like building a house: If the owners suddenly decide they want a big floor-to-ceiling picture window on the second floor, it may require rerouting water pipes. That may require moving the ground-floor bathroom, which in turn could affect the kitchen layout, because the bathtub and the kitchen sink share drain pipes. Part of project management’s job is to say “no” to many change requests, but that’s not always possible.

What if more computers are added? That’s not always a solution. If the computers have to share access to resources – say, a database of people who have signed up – it gets complicated. Suppose you’ve invited many people over for dinner, more than you’ve ever hosted before. You and your spouse decide to share the preparation and cooking. Maybe you have sufficient counter space, but you still have only one sink, one stove and one oven. With two people, it might be relatively straightforward to take turns, but with three or four or more cooks, it can get crazy.

Finally, there’s the “system integration” problem of combining the different components. A system like the insurance exchanges is built in parts. Eventually, like a jigsaw puzzle, all the pieces have to be put together. Do the slots and tongues line up properly? Are the right parts of the picture on the right pieces? Did all of the contractors use the same shade of green for the grass?

There are standard approaches, standard tools and standard software for building large-scale websites. Using them correctly takes good planning and management. That was in short supply here.

The contractors building HealthCare.gov couldn’t control the budget or the timing for the regulations; those were the product of Washington politics. While there are apparent programming and design errors, it’s quite likely that most are the result of requirement changes rather than incompetence.

The overall failure appears to have been one of project management on the part of the government. In the best of all possible worlds, the site would have launched seamlessly to serve the entire nation. But software is hard. Inexperience doesn’t help. And politics just makes things messier.

The Obama administration is “excruciatingly” embarrassed and is working hard to get the glitches fixed. Let’s hope things go more smoothly the next time around.

Jun 26 2017,Senate Republicans just released a significant change to their healthcare bill,Business Insider,left,http://www.businessinsider.com/senate-healthcare-bill-trumpcare-ahca-details-changes-2017-6,"Senate Republicans on Monday released an updated version of their plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

The legislation — called the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 — debuted on June 22. The bill proposes rolling back much of the ACA, the healthcare law better known as Obamacare, including various tax provisions.

The revised version of the bill includes a provision that's meant to replace the individual mandate by punishing people whose insurance has lapsed, locking them out of coverage for six months.

The revision closes a loophole in the original bill that could have hurt the health insurance market. To avoid adverse selection in the individual insurance market, there needs to be a continuous-coverage provision to keep healthy people buying insurance instead of waiting until they're sick to do so.

Healthier people paying into the pool helps ensure that costs for everyone stay lower. To make sure the market isn't full of sick people — resulting in higher costs and financial losses for insurers — there needs to be some reason for healthy people to sign up. The most effective way to do so is by having the carrot of coverage benefits and the stick punishing those who do not have coverage.

Under Obamacare, this stick was the tax penalty for not having coverage. In the House Republicans' bill, people who did not maintain coverage the year before could have their premiums raised by as much as 30% as a penalty.

According to Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health-policy think tank, the new provision may not work as intended.

""I doubt this encourages many healthy people to sign up,"" Levitt tweeted on Monday after the changes were announced. ""That requires a lot of foresight among people not very focused on insurance.""

The bill also tweaks some of the language in Section 106, which discusses stability-program funding for states.

What else is in the BCRA

The legislation proposes scaling back funding that goes toward health coverage for low-income Americans and tax credits for middle-income earners who purchase their own health insurance.

The plan would also provide funding designed to help stabilize the Obamacare insurance markets in the near term and funnel money through programs to cut off access to funding for abortion providers.

The Senate legislation contains key differences from the American Health Care Act, the House GOP's legislation to dismantle Obamacare. The disparities could be sticking points if the two chambers have to compromise on the bill, which they would have to do before it could reach President Donald Trump's desk.

But first, the legislation faces an uncertain future in the Senate, as it faces some pushback from conservative members who think it may not go far enough in repealing Obamacare and moderates concerned about its slashing of Medicaid spending. Like the House legislation, it could be subject to significant changes to get the needed number of votes.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing for a vote by the end of the week, in part to avoid further public scrutiny of the bill over the weeklong July 4 recess. Similar scrutiny periled the original version of the House legislation. McConnell can afford to lose just two members of his conference for the bill to pass.

Here's a rundown of the key provisions that were already in the bill:

Tax credits: What's in the bill: To help people pay for insurance, the Senate bill proposes tax credits based on income level, a feature of Obamacare, rather than on age, as the House bill calls for. The bill would make anyone earning up to 350% of the federal poverty level eligible for credits; Obamacare caps that at 400%. It would, however, adjust the credits to be less generous as a person ages. For instance, a 33-year-old making 175% of the federal poverty level would receive enough in credits so they spend 5.3% of their income on premiums. For people over 59, that would increase to 8.3%. Additionally, the credits would be capped at a lower percentage of overall medical costs than those under Obamacare, making them less generous overall. What it means: While the tax credits would be more generous for older Americans than the tax credits in the House bill, fewer middle-income people would get financial support to pay for coverage — and those who did would get less.

Medicaid expansion: What's in the bill: Obamacare's Medicaid expansion, which extended the program to those making 100% to 138% of the federal poverty level, would be phased out over four years — 90% of the current federal funding would be provided in 2020, decreasing by 5% each year until 2023, after which it would be eliminated. People would not be allowed to join the expansion from 2020 onward. The tax credits would be available to people who fell off the expansion. What it means: While this would save the federal government money, it would also mean the millions of people who have gained access to Medicaid would be rolled off. These people would be able to fall back on the less generous tax credits and access coverage through the individual insurance market.

Medicaid spending growth: What's in the bill: The Senate bill retains the House's per capita cap for federal Medicaid spending. After 2025, however, growth in spending would shift from being tied to the consumer price index for medical care to the CPI for all goods, a lower level of growth. What it means: States would receive less funding each year from the federal government to help cover low-income Americans, and after 2025 the rate of growth would decline, possibly leading to even deeper cuts to the program.

States can institute Medicaid work requirements: What's in the bill: This would allow states to create a provision under which people must maintain employment, as the state defines, for a period, also determined by the state, for a person to receive Medicaid. What it means: This is another longtime wish for Republicans, but it would also give states significant leeway to define what counts as work and how long someone has to hold a job to be eligible. It would not apply to students, pregnant women, or people with disabilities.

Cost-sharing subsidies: What's in the bill: The bill would allocate money for cost-sharing subsidies through 2019. These payments offset the costs for insurers to offer low-income Americans plans with smaller out-of-pocket costs. The uncertainty around these payments has led to instability in the individual insurance market. What it means: This should reassure insurers desperate for guidance ahead of the 2018 plan year and could bring down premium increases for the individual insurance market.

State waivers for Obamacare regulations: What's in the bill: The Senate bill would allow states to request a waiver to opt out of Obamacare's so-called essential health benefits, which mandate that all plans must cover 10 basic types of care. The ability to opt out of providing those benefits was a sticking point in the House legislation, and its inclusion ultimately allowed it to pass. The Senate bill, however, would not allow states to repeal community rating, the provision mandating that all people of the same age in the same area be charged the same amount. That's a change from the House bill, which drew criticism from health-policy experts who said a repeal of community rating would allow insurers to charge people with preexisting conditions more. What it means: If a state were to receive a waiver for the benefits, it would allow for skimpier coverage offerings on its insurance market that would have cheaper premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs.

Repeal Obamacare's taxes: What's in the bill: Much like the House version, the Senate bill would do away with things like Obamacare's 3.8% tax on investment income on people earning more than $200,000 annually. What it means: The taxes in Obamacare fall predominantly on a small percentage of wealthy Americans who would see their tax bills decrease under the Senate bill. For instance, the Republican megadonor and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson could have his 2017 tax bill cut by roughly $44 million.

A fund to provide grants to fight the opioid crisis: What's in the bill: The bill would establish a $2 billion fund for states for programs to ""support substance use disorder treatment and recovery support services for individuals with mental or substance use disorders."" What it means: This is a one-time fund for 2018, but it is likely to be favored by senators from states hit hard by the opioid crisis. It was a key ask from Ohio Sen. Rob Portman.

No funds can be used for abortions: What's in the bill: No plan purchased using funding from the bill could cover abortions. Additionally, none of the funds allocated by the bill could be given to healthcare providers that offer abortion services. What it means: In addition to restricting anyone who used the credits or other funds from getting plans that cover abortions, this would effectively defund Planned Parenthood. It is unclear if this provision will pass Senate rules.



Here is the full updated bill:"
Apr 03 2020,Democrats: Phase four coronavirus legislation must reopen healthcare exchanges,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/democrats-phase-four-coronavirus-legislation-must-reopen-healthcare-exchanges,"Senate Democrats say Congress needs to pass a new economic relief package that would also reopen Obamacare exchanges for people needing treatment for the coronavirus.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said on a call with reporters that they do not favor a Trump administration plan to provide direct financial aid to people who lack healthcare instead of reopening the healthcare exchanges.

Democrats will push to include a provision to open a special enrollment period in a new economic relief package that has yet to be drafted. Congress has already passed three federal aid measures, including a $2.2 trillion package signed into law last week.

“There are a lot of people who don’t have healthcare, many of whom are qualified” for the Obamacare exchanges, Schumer said, adding, “It’s something I would look at” including in a new round of economic relief legislation. “This is a crisis, and any way we can try to get people healthcare, we should do it, and this is one route.”

President Trump said during a Thursday press conference that his administration planned to arrange direct aid to the uninsured rather than allow them to enroll in the now-closed healthcare exchanges.

“At this point, the White House coronavirus task force is working on a proposal for the president to use some of the $100 billion that we are making available to hospitals to compensate the hospitals directly for any coronavirus treatment that they provide to uninsured Americans,” Vice President Mike Pence said, explaining the plan.

Wyden rejected the proposal.

“It just looks like the administration is twisting itself in knots to come up with these far-fetched theories that don’t get at the real problem,” Wyden said.

Wyden said the pledge by Pence to cover the costs of the coronavirus amounted to “promises that those without coverage cannot count on.”

Democrats called a press conference with reporters to announce they were demanding a response from the Department of Labor about the delivery of $600 in additional unemployment pay that was included in the last economic relief package.

“We Democrats are going to hold the Trump administration’s feet to the fire, to make sure they get it done and get it done right,” Schumer told reporters. “And at the top of the list, the administration must ensure that people get their new unemployment insurance checks within two weeks. That is very important. And if they don’t, then the American people are going to hold the president’s administration accountable.”"
May 05 2017,Republicans hate their own healthcare bill—but they passed it anyway,Daily Kos,left,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/5/5/1659195/-Republicans-hate-their-own-healthcare-bill-but-didn-t-care-what-they-were-passing,"The important thing on Thursday was for Republicans to pass a bill. After all, Paul Ryan had the beer ordered, Donald Trump was tapping his foot in the Rose Garden, and lots of Republican legislators had already read and practiced their speeches about “leadership.” Which is a lot more than can be said about their familiarity with the bill they were voting on.

Wolf Blitzer: “Did you read the health care bill?” Republican Rep. Chris Collins: ""I will fully admit, Wolf, I did not.”

Collins isn’t alone in casting a blind vote for a bill that few had read and even fewer understood.

In many ways, Republicans appear to be operating in the dark about the AHCA. There have been very few hearings. The full bill text was only unveiled hours before the vote. The Congressional Budget Office didn't have time to finish its study of the legislation. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday it is ""literally impossible"" to judge the impact of the bill. For his part, Trump, in interviews and conversations with associates, has seemed to care little about what the legislation says.

What it says doesn’t matter. What it does can’t be measured. How then are Republicans convinced that their bill is worthy of a Bud Light? The answer is: They don’t care.

Because somehow passing a bad bill they didn’t believe in is supposed to better than not passing that bill.

Donate $1 to nominee funds targeting vulnerable House Republicans who voted to destroy access to health care.

Thursday’s actions may include provisions that could cut short the lives of millions of Americans and cause other untold misery, but the primary motivation behind the Republican “healthcare bill,” isn’t one of evil — it’s one of desperation. Republicans are so incapable of taking appropriate action, that they think it the height of progress that they can pass anything, anything at all, out of a chamber they dominate.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) also pushed the idea that Republicans just need to pull the trigger on this bill because it will change. “This thing is going to go to the United States Senate. It’s going to change in my view,” he said on NPR. “At some point you just have to move, and we think this is it. This will create some momentum.”

That’s not leadership. That’s the top contender for Profiles in Pitiful, one of the sorriest moments in the history of American politics. Republicans literally threw a celebration for a bill they didn’t read, didn’t like, and which they passed for no purpose other than to show they could pass a bill.

Please, Paul Ryan, take another bow. You deserve it.

Inside the White House, senior administration officials say no one ""really loves the legislation,"" in the words of one official. Trump has expressed misgivings — particularly over fears that people will lose health care and blame him. He has spoken more about blasting Obamacare than selling his own legislation, barely bringing up the new plan at a rally last Saturday night, and only at the very end of his speech.

Republicans just spent a day threatening Americans with the loss of their healthcare simply to demonstrate their “leadership” by being willing to come together around a bill that not only won’t pass, but which they don’t want to pass.

Which explains why Trump was having a celebration after completing only one step in a long process—it’s as far as he’s going to get.

Feb 04 2017,"HealthCare.gov signups fall short of last year, at 9.2M",Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/3/healthcaregov-signups-fall-short-last-year-92m/,"The Trump administration said Friday that 9.2 million people signed up for health coverage this year on the main Obamacare website, a drop-off of about 400,000 customers from last year’s effort.

Activity on HealthCare.gov had been running ahead of 2016 signups in the final weeks of President Obama’s tenure, despite rampant GOP talk of repeal, yet that enthusiasm appeared to wane ahead of the Jan. 31 deadline.

The update doesn’t include final data from a dozen state-run exchanges, although available figures show that at least 12 million people selected private coverage for the 2017 plan year under the Affordable Care Act, often with the help of taxpayer-funded subsidies.

Unless the remaining states report a robust finish, the law will fall short of Mr. Obama’s target of 13.8 million signups for this year.

“Signups are falling somewhat short of last year, which is movement in the wrong direction for improving the risk pool but hardly a collapse,” said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Democrats insist the law can still be fixed, yet congressional Republicans seeking to repeal and replace the law with President Trump said the federal update showed dwindling interest in the law and that numbers would droop further, since customers must effectuate their coverage by paying their first month’s bill.

“Not only have today’s numbers failed to keep pace with last year’s, they also fail to account for those individuals who will actually follow through and pay the premiums,” Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, Utah Republican, said. “Whether families can and will pay the 25 percent average increase over last year for benchmark plans remains in question. Either way, enrollment numbers are down and costs are up. These cost hikes are exactly the reason why Republicans are committed to repealing and replacing Obamacare.”

Obamacare’s supporters, meanwhile, interpreted the figures as a testament to the law’s staying power, despite rampant talk of repeal and Mr. Trump’s decision to yank up to $5 million TV and radio advertising ahead of a crucial final week of signups.

Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department under Mr. Obama, said “the Trump administration’s efforts to suppress enrollment clearly had an impact.”

There were roughly 375,000 in the final two weeks of 2017 enrollment compared to roughly 700,000 in the last week of last year’s effort alone.

“When President Obama left office, enrollment was outpacing last year,” Mr. Wakana said. “Since taking office, the new administration deliberately sabotaged the law: pulled down advertising, threatened outreach efforts, and sewed uncertainty about consumer protections. 12 million people are now covered, and Republicans must come up with a plan before ripping their health care away.”

Friday’s announcement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services exhibited a clear shift in tone from the Obama era, when agency officials cheered the law at every turn.

Under Mr. Trump, the agency noted that customers faced an average premium hike of 25 percent among popular “benchmark plans” and a 28-percent drop in the number of participating insurers in 2017.

Apr 04 2017,The Essential Question Needing An Answer Before Healthcare Can Be Reformed,The Daily Caller,right,http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/04/the-essential-question-needing-an-answer-before-healthcare-can-be-reformed/,"Election Day 2016 should have been Christmas morning for Republicans. Long awaited control of the White House and both houses of Congress. A chance to deliver on an every two-year election cycle promise to repeal and replace Obamacare. In 2010 Republicans needed the House. They got it. In 2014, it was the Senate. Delivered. But we still need the White House they said. Asked and answered with President Donald Trump.

So, what happened a few weeks ago when the House bill fizzled like a North Korean missile launch? Disparate factions within the House couldn’t unify behind Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan, despite pressure from the White House. For some it wasn’t a repeal, only a rearranging of the deck chairs on the sinking Obamacare ship. Others in the GOP were happy with the status quo, preferring to rail against Obamacare in campaign speeches rather delivering on empty campaign promises. Still others, #NeverTrumpers, knowing that President Trump was behind the House bill, preferred to see the bill, and Trump, fail.

Kudos to the Democrats. When they ran the show in 2008, they herded their cats and passed Obamacare. No Statist Caucus on one side or a Tuesday (or Thursday or Friday) group on the other side, each wanting their own version of healthcare reform.

The GOP will likely regroup and take another bite of the apple. What the final product will look like is anyone’s guess. Will it get through the Senate? Can it be passed via reconciliation or will the filibuster have to be nuked?

First, the GOP must answer a fundamental question. Is healthcare a right or a privilege? I don’t mean a discussion at a think tank or in a university classroom. But here and now in the United States based on what we as a country want. A recent Pew Research Center poll shows 60 percent of Americans favor universal coverage, meaning healthcare as a right.

Free market conservatives want the government out of healthcare. Certainly the federal government. Turn it over to the states via the Tenth Amendment or leave it to the market, like purchasing and insuring a home.

If healthcare is a privilege, not a right, what about the 10-year-old with leukemia whose family can’t afford six-figure cancer care? Or the working diabetic needing a $2000 per dose drug injected into each eye once a month so that he can maintain his vision, work, drive and support his family? How about the 20-year-old who fractured her leg on the ski slopes but doesn’t have insurance, savings or family support to pay the medical bill?

On the other hand, if healthcare is a right, an entitlement, then how much is enough? How much healthcare can society, meaning taxpayers, be expected to fund? What medicines and treatments are covered? What’s the free meal? Meatloaf and mashed potatoes or filet mignon and lobster? With a limited supply and unlimited demand, some form of rationing will be necessary.

Until these two competing concepts are reconciled, healthcare reform goes nowhere, just a patchwork attempting to satisfy both sides of the argument, but in the end satisfying neither.

Most developed countries have parallel public and private healthcare systems. A public option covering everyone, with minimal or no out-of-pocket expense to patients, but with long wait times for care and limited treatment options. And a private option allowing individuals to purchase the healthcare or insurance they want and need, paying for it themselves, without subsidies, tax breaks or any government assistance. One option a right, the other a privilege.

For an analogy, think of K-12 schools. A public option available without cost to students. For most, a good and more than adequate education. And a free-market private school option for those who desire and have the means. Shop around, pay as much as you want, or default to the public option.

Each system has its pros and cons, but they are separate and distinct. Instead we are trying to combine both into a single scheme — Obamacare, Ryancare or whatever finally emerges from Congress. We get the worst of both systems – bureaucracy and high cost. And the best of neither – no universal coverage and limited freedom of choice.

Wouldn’t it make more sense to simply create the two-system approach here in the US? Then my question wouldn’t need answering. The public system would be the “right” and the private system would be the “privilege.” This difficult to answer question, which legislators won’t touch with a ten-foot pole, can be easily answered by choosing “both.”

Trump confirmed his phone call with Schumer early Saturday morning after tweeting, ""I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!""

I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017

Axios attributed its report to ""Republican sources."" Trump was seeking ""a path forward on healthcare,"" the source said.

The contents of the call were not reported, but word about it circulated quickly on Capitol Hill, Axios reported.

""It codifies the Rs' failure on repeal-replace and shows the president can move without hesitation or ideological impediment to make a deal with the Dems,"" one ""well-wired Republican"" told Axios, apparently in an email.

""It depresses R base turnout in the mid-terms, as Trump voters are further disconnected from the congressional wing.""

President Trump's promise to repeal and replace Obamacare has gone unfulfilled, as Republicans have repeatedly failed to pass legislation to end the Affordable Care Act after vowing to do so since it was passed in 2010.

Also Friday, the administration rolled back Obamacare's controversial birth-control mandate, allowing virtually any employer to claim a religious or moral objection to paying for contraceptives.

The Axios report could indicate that Trump is prepared to reach out to Democrats to move his healthcare agenda forward.

Last month, Trump sided with Democrats on a three-month extension of the debt limit and a $15.25 billion bill to provide relief to Hurricane Harvey victims.

He reached the deal after meeting at the White House with congressional leaders, later telling reporters that the deal would be ""very good.""

Schumer, the Senate's minority leader and New York Democrat, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, attended the meeting.

Trump had dismissed the arguments of fellow Republicans — including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin — who sought a longer debt extension.

Congress passed the legislation that week.

The president also met with Schumer and Pelosi over dinner at the White House, after which the Democrats announced that the president was supporting legislation for the expiring Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

The Democrats said Trump agreed to exclude his demand for a border wall from any DACA agreement.

The White House, however, disputed that claim — and Trump later declared ""if we don't have a wall, we're doing nothing.""

The previous week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Trump was giving Congress six months to find a permanent solution to DACA, which was enacted by former President Barack Obama in 2012 via executive order.

California’s governor, Democrat Gavin Newsom, signed AB 133 into law Tuesday which opened the state's Medi-Cal rolls to illegal aliens 50 years and older in a move that the governor referred to as a ""major milestone.""

""We're investing California’s historic surplus to accomplish transformative changes we’ve long dreamed of – including this historic Medi-Cal expansion to ensure thousands of older undocumented Californians, many of whom have been serving on the front lines of the pandemic, can access critical health care services,"" Newsom said. ""I thank the Legislature for its steadfast partnership to bring California closer to universal health care coverage and advance comprehensive initiatives to ensure California’s communities come back from the pandemic stronger and healthier than before.""

Last year, Newsom signed SB-104 into law which extended health care benefits to individuals ages 19-25, regardless of immigration status.

The bill signed into law Tuesday is expected to cost California taxpayers at least $1.3 billion.

It has been estimated that at least 3 million illegal immigrants reside in California and the new law will take effect in May of next year.

Newsom is currently facing a recall election in September. New polling shows that 47% of voters polled said they support removing the governor from office.

If 50% of voters in the recall election say they want Newsom removed, the Republican challenger with the most votes will likely assume his role. Currently, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder is polling the highest among Newsom’s challengers.

The recall push began last June in response to Newsom’s strict coronavirus lockdown orders and mask requirements which, along with the state’s high taxes and intensifying homeless crisis, caused many Californians to call for his removal with many of them even fleeing the state. Newsom was also criticized for being spotted at a ritzy restaurant skirting his own requirements and dining mask-less with a large group of people indoors."
Dec 18 2016,Obamacare boasts biggest day ever Thursday on HealthCare.gov,USA TODAY,left,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2016/12/16/obamacare-boasts-biggest-day-ever-thursday-healthcaregov/95523966/,"Jayne O'Donnell

USA TODAY

More people signed up for insurance on HealthCare.gov on Thursday than any time since the launch of the Affordable Care Act exchanges three years ago, President Obama announced Friday.

More than 670,000 people signed up for coverage ahead of the Dec. 15 deadline for Jan. 1 coverage. And that's despite the fact about 1 million people had to leave their contact information as they couldn't get on the site. About 600,000 people signed up last year on Dec. 15.

The traffic jam prompted the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to announce late Thursday that the deadline for enrollment on the federal exchange was extended until 11:59 PM PST on Dec. 19. HealthCare.gov handles enrollment for 38 states. Deadlines for state exchanges vary, but several allow enrollment for Jan. 1 coverage for a few more days.

Signups rose steadily this week. On Monday, more than 325,000 Americans selected plans on HealthCare.gov. On Tuesday, more than 380,000 Americans selected plans on HealthCare.gov, marking two of the biggest days in HealthCare.gov history.

Obamacare was profitable for some insurers despite public comments

Obamacare enrollment deadline looms amid questions about replacement

Obama, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and comedian Bill Murray were among those doing videos to encourage enrollment.

The administration has been aggressively promoting the law as Republican members of Congress and President-elect Donald Trump vow to repeal it next month. Even with a repeal, however, people who don't have insurance through their jobs will still be required to buy it at least through 2017 and likely longer. A plan to replace the ACA could take several years.

Earlier this week, Burwell went on a four-city tour to Tampa, Orlando, New York and East Newark,N.J., to meet with people who benefited from the ACA and encourage Americans to get covered.

Throughout our history, women and men with courage, indignation and integrity have stepped forward to whistleblow and put an end to wrongdoing even if they themselves have heretofore been part of the problem. One of these is healthcare reform advocate Wendell Potter.

Eleven years ago, after a moment of reckoning at a country health clinic in Tennessee, Potter left a high-ranking job as head of corporate communications at Cigna to tell the truth about the excesses and abuses of the health insurance industry. Since then, he has worked hard to spread the word, authoring two best-selling books, Nation on the Take (with Nick Penniman) and Deadly Spin, and founding the nonprofit investigative journalism site Tarbell.org, named after muckraking Progressive Era reporter Ida Tarbell.

Now, among all his other efforts, activist Wendell Potter has become president of Business for Medicare for All, the only national business organization working for single payer health insurance. This group of the economically pragmatic lends expertise and credibility to the cause of reform at a time when many, including some of those running for the Democratic presidential nomination, question the viability of single payer.

I have known Wendell Potter for a decade. We broke the news of his whistleblowing at Bill Moyers Journal in 2009 when he came to us both with his story and the corporate documents to back it up. My conversation with him below has been edited for length and clarity.

Let's begin with your background for people who aren't familiar with how you became committed to healthcare reform and specifically to the idea of Medicare for All.

I spent 20 years inside the insurance industry. It was a career I never could have anticipated. I was a journalist in my first career out of school, I grew up in Tennessee, and was a reporter in Memphis and finally, Washington. I covered Congress and the White House for the Scripps Howard newspapers.

Then I got into PR work, wound up working for Humana, and then Cigna, two of the biggest health insurance companies, altogether for about 20 years.

I rose up the ranks and was heading corporate communications at Cigna when I had a crisis of conscience. I came to realize that what I was doing for a living was, in too many cases, the exact opposite of what I tried to do as a reporter. I realized I was misleading people. I told myself the story that I never intentionally lied to people, but I was misleading people to perpetuate the private insurance industry, and was a willing cheerleader for the industry for a long time.

I came to realize that what I was doing not only was so far afield from what I used to do as a reporter, but also that I played a role in perpetuating a very broken and dysfunctional and unfair healthcare system. On a trip back to Tennessee to see family, I went to something called a healthcare expedition that was being held at a county fairgrounds nearby. I went there out of curiosity.

I've often said that it was my road-to-Damascus experience. I saw people who were waiting in long lines to get care in barns and animal stalls. It [broke] my heart. It made me realize that I had some responsibility for that, and I made a commitment that day to try to figure out some other way to earn a living.

There were other reasons. I was beginning to grow disenchanted with what I was expected to say and be a cheerleader for. In particular, this was at the beginning or at the early stages of insurance companies moving everyone to the high deductible plans and I began to question that policy. I knew from experience that working from the inside trying to change something that was an industry-wide strategy was just not something that I would have any ability to influence.

So I left. I became a critic of the industry and ultimately decided to be a very public critic of the industry and testified before Congress. As you well know, one of my first times in the media was an interview with Bill Moyers.

I remember meeting in secret with you and Bill and one of our producers.

It was in secret and you guys grilled me for, I don't know how long, but you obviously wanted to make sure that I knew what I was talking about and was the real deal and would be someone worthy of TV journalism.

Medical costs are out of control. You’ve said the current system is not sustainable and not repairable. So what do we do?

I think the only alternative is to expand a program that's worked for more than 50 years now -- Medicare. All surveys show that people who are enrolled in Medicare, even today, despite some of the inadequacies of the current program, are much more satisfied with Medicare than people enrolled in private plans.

One reason for that is because private insurance has changed significantly over the years. Not only have premiums gone up, but insurance companies also have figured out ways to avoid paying for care in many different ways.

There's a term in the industry that you don't hear very often outside of boardrooms or calls with financial analysts called “benefit buydown.” And it’s a term that describes a lot of the things that insurance companies are able to do to decrease the value of your private coverage, whether it's moving people into high deductible plans, making them pay a lot more for care out of their own pockets before their coverage kicks in, limiting their choice of access to doctors and hospitals, having someone at an insurance company decide whether or not you're eligible for a procedure your doctor says you need. All these things have been going on for several years and they make health insurance much less valuable than it used to be.

Another aspect of private insurance companies that's become prevalent is to very much restrict which doctors and hospitals you can go to through these so-called limited or skinny networks. That continues. So people in private plans have less choice, but they're paying more for it and having to jump through hoops to get their bills paid.

That has not happened in the Medicare program. Medicare is a program that cares for, or provides access to care for the oldest and in fact the sickest in our population. They've done it well, and the administrative costs of that program have been far, far less than in the private insurance industry. So it makes a lot of sense to take what we've got, which has worked for people for generations now, expand it to cover everybody and eliminate an unnecessary middleman, which is the insurance industry.

One of the things that I can remember so vividly toward the end of my career was attending a leadership meeting with our then CEO at Cigna, and someone asked him what kept him up at night. He used a word that you don't use everyday -- disintermediation. It's a word that means essentially disrupting or getting rid of the middleman, the unnecessary middleman. He went on to say that he feared that at some point Americans, and in particular American employers, would begin to question “the value proposition,” to use business jargon, of the private insurance industry.

We've reached that point. As you noted, my nonprofit organization is called Business for Medicare for All. We make the economic, the business case for moving to a Medicare For All type of healthcare system, and employers are indeed waking up to realize that over decades they've been sold a bill of goods by private insurers. They keep coming up with ways to shift more of the cost of care to employees and their dependents. So it's time to move to a program that makes a lot of sense economically as well as morally.

How did you become involved in Business for Medicare for All? What was the idea behind it? How did it happen?

About three years ago, I was approached by a business leader in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, Richard Master, who decided to make a documentary on the US healthcare system. He wanted to interview me. It became very clear that he was an advocate for expanding the Medicare program. He's a very successful businessman. His company is called MCS Industries and it's based in eastern Pennsylvania. They’re the country's biggest seller of picture frames and mirrors and decorative stuff like that.

But he began to pay a lot of attention to healthcare costs. He's got an MBA from Wharton and a law degree from Columbia so this guy's really smart, has built a very successful business, but he was questioning the sanity of a system in which he has no control over his healthcare costs from year to year.

I realized that his situation wasn't unique. Every year, he was spending more and more to provide coverage to his workers. He was committed to that, but he was having an increasingly challenging time making the numbers work. So he did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that we’re alone in the developed world in having a system that is run by insurance companies.

So he essentially woke me up to the problems that American businesses are facing. I knew what individuals and families were facing, but I hadn't paid a lot of attention to what is happening to employers who are trying to stay in the game in our uniquely American, employer-based healthcare system. It's abundantly clear that the system has run its course and is just not working for increasingly large numbers of employers. Certainly small businesses, most small businesses in this country, if they ever offered coverage, have thrown in the towel because they simply can't afford to do it.

His company is a midsize business, but he and a lot of other CEOs of midsize businesses and large companies are beginning to question the value proposition that insurance companies have always sold them on. Even some of the huge employers in this country are recognizing that. Boeing, in markets where it has a lot of workers, is bypassing that middleman and contracting directly with hospitals and doctors in markets like Seattle, Charleston, South Carolina, and southern California.

So I've learned a lot about the plight that American businesses are facing. Even Warren Buffett said a few years ago that the US healthcare system is the tapeworm that is destroying American competitiveness. American companies are becoming increasingly uncompetitive in the global marketplace, and he's right. His partner Charlie Munger, who's a Republican, has said that the only alternative he can see that makes sense is moving to a single-payer, Medicare for All type of healthcare system. So business leaders are beginning to step up and let their voices be known, and that's why we exist -- to give them a voice collectively.

We've got several hundred employers who are part of our organization. Our goal is to have at least one business from every congressional district by this time next year. We're growing pretty rapidly and we already have a voice in Washington.

You're saying, who knows better the impact of healthcare on people trying to run a business.

That's exactly right. The insurance industry, one of its current campaigns is called Coverage At Work and it’s trying to perpetuate the notion that our employer-based system works and needs to be sustained.

But it's unraveling. In 1999, I think this was from the Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 69% of employers were offering coverage. It is now down into the 50s. We have this belief that most employers offer coverage, but very few small businesses now do, and that's where most jobs are generated. A lot of people still work for large companies, but the biggest job engine, if you will, or job creators, as the Republicans often say, are small businesses and they just cannot offer benefits like we used to see.

We also have the situation now with the growing gig economy and the fact that people may have as many as a dozen different jobs in a dozen different workplaces over the course of a career. Medicare for All offers portability, whereas if you have to keep switching from place to place to place, they may or may not have an employer health plan. It really messes you up.

That's exactly right and more of us are in that boat. People who are drivers for Uber and Lyft, for example, sometimes they will have a regular job that offers benefits, but more often than not, they work two or three other jobs, none of which offer benefits and so they drive to supplement their income. These companies don't offer health insurance benefits. Lyft and Uber don't because they don't consider the [drivers] employees. So we have a sizable and growing population of people who are in the gig economy and that's going to continue.

Some of the businesses that are most interested in our work are companies like that. One of our members is Postmates, the delivery service. They get this -- I mean, they know that the people who drive for them need health insurance and health benefits and having a Medicare for All type of system covers everybody and employers are unburdened with the responsibility of directly providing that coverage. It doesn't mean that they're off the hook for providing financing for this. When we are talking about Medicare for All, we're talking about a publicly financed health care system that individuals and businesses would pay to support.

And it's not creeping “socialized medicine.”

It's not at all. In fact, that is a term, as you well know, that's often used by opponents of any kind of reform. To be honest with you, I used to use that term a lot at my old job to try to get people to believe that any kind of reform that we didn't agree with was socialized medicine.

As you probably know, that term really began to be used and take hold during the Cold War era, in the latter part of the Truman administration, when he was advocating for universal health care. The American Medical Association was dead set against it and began to rail against socialized medicine.

What we are advocating is not a system like the UK system in England and Scotland and some other places in which the government actually owns most of the hospitals and employs most of the doctors. You might be able to get away with calling that socialized medicine to a certain extent, but what we're advocating is publicly financed, privately delivered healthcare, more like the Canadian model. We're not suggesting that we just import the Canadian system, but it would have a lot of similarities to that…

So why is it that so many people, including some of our candidates for president, are still pushing the public option, the idea of choice, of still being able to get your private insurance or the government option?

When Congress was debating what became the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, I was one of the most vocal proponents of the public option.

The reason was because at that time, that was as good as we could possibly get because President Obama and congressional Democrats had decided to try to keep the current system in place, make some significant changes to expand coverage in certain ways but to a large extent, keep the private insurance system controlling the healthcare system, serving as the gatekeeper. So President Obama said, ""Let's have a public option,"" as he put it, ""to keep private insurance companies honest.""

This just shows you how much things have changed. Ten years ago, there really was no serious consideration in Congress for Medicare for All or single-payer healthcare. At that time, it was just considered something that Congress would never consider. Flash forward 10 years, and you have a majority of Democrats in the House signed on to legislation that would create a Medicare For All type of healthcare system.

But a lot of the presidential candidates are not there yet. The ones who are: Bernie Sanders is the chief sponsor of the Medicare for All bill in the Senate and Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and I think Julian Castro are co-sponsors.

But Kamala Harris then kind of backed away from Medicare for All.

She did, she's had two or three different positions on it, or at least clarifications, I guess she's called it, or explanations. I don't know what she said most recently, but essentially she is saying, let’s keep private insurers in the mix, that it might be too disruptive to suggest that people might lose their private insurance. She was not there initially, but in her more recent statements, she has kind of changed to say that.

I think the reason is because there are people who have been led to believe that people are so attached to private health insurance that they would oppose a policy change or a law that would ultimately make private insurance unnecessary, and then people would “lose” their private insurance.

If you look closely when you're polling Americans, they're concerned about losing something they had that's valuable, but what they're most concerned about is having coverage that they can afford and that is secure, that's not going to go away when you lose or change jobs. And the choice they're most interested in is having a broader choice of doctors and hospitals. Most of the top line survey results you see [indicate] those people are concerned about losing private health insurance, but if you drill down, they may be happy to move away from that system as long as you can assure them that they will have access to the doctors and hospitals that they want and that it's going to be secure, they won't lose it, and that it's affordable.

Elizabeth Warren said in Houston at the last debate, everybody loves their doctor. Everybody loves their nurses. Everybody loves their therapists. I don't know anybody who says they love their insurance company.

And she was right! Back in my old days in the industry, I can recall when we did what we could to try to see if we could change public attitudes toward insurance companies. I'll be honest with you, for quite a period of time, I wouldn't tell people what I did for a living because private insurance companies have never had a good reputation. The reality is that it's the system we grew up with, and a lot of people have been led to believe that government is bad, and the government can't do anything efficiently, and ignore the fact that the Medicare program has been operating very efficiently, serving the oldest in our country for many years.

And it was really up and running in a year. They had it running efficiently very quickly.

That's exactly a point that I make as well. People say, ""Gosh, you're talking about something that would be so disruptive and how can you pull that off in a short period of time?"" [Medicare] was up and running in a year back in the 60s.

One of the reasons why there were problems associated with implementing [the Affordable Care Act] was because it was built around the existing multi-payer system. It's enormously complex. To roll out a system that's built on that and to try to set up a mechanism in which people are still faced with multiple choices and you're having to set up some kind of an exchange, as was done to make sure that you had a program that had all these multiple insurers and their multiple plans, it's enormously complex, but a transition to Medicare would be much, much simpler.

I'm in a labor union. Medicare is my primary coverage and my secondary is my union plan. It's a very good plan. What do you say to someone like me, a union member, about giving that up in exchange for Medicare for All?

You have to be assured that what you would be giving up would be replaced with something that would be at least as valuable and that it would not be disruptive. A lot of union members have expressed concern because these healthcare benefits in many cases have been hard fought.

One of the things I would tell you is that you might have good health care coverage or at least better than some people in this country have. You may have benefits that are richer, to use a term that's often used, but there's no security that you will keep that job. If you are a union member in those places, you can still lose your job, still experience a plant closure and then you can lose your coverage.

In my case, I'm vested in my union plan.

So you have to be persuaded that you will have benefits that are even better or no worse than what you currently have, and we can make that assurance. Even in most union plans these days, the participants are increasingly facing higher deductibles. They're having to pay more out of their own pockets before their coverage kicks in. They're not immune to that. Increasingly, the networks of providers are more and more limited.

This year, you might have the doctor that you prefer to use, next year you might not. It's out of your hands and you probably didn't have a choice of insurance carrier. That was made for you. So this notion that even people who have union plans have a choice of health insurers, it's not true, because those decisions were made by somebody else and typically, you're never asked.

I think those who have union jobs in many cases have better benefits than those who don't have union representation. Still, employers are faced with a conundrum. Private health insurers cannot and do not, nor do they want to control healthcare costs. So those costs continue to go up, and because we have the system we have and private insurers are really the only game in town, they're able to demand more of employers every year in terms of premiums and higher costs to provide coverage to workers.

Then there are these other things that are now common in private plans, like having a denial nurse or a medical director who is really in place in these insurance companies to determine whether you will get the care that your doctor says you need. Union members are not exempt from that. That's something that most people don't really fully appreciate until they really become very ill or injured and are finding that they and their doctors don't have the final say as to whether they'll get coverage for a treatment that even is listed as a covered benefit.

You’ve heard me tell this story, but the thing that was the final straw for me was having to defend my old company and be the spokesman for the company when a 17-year-old girl in California was scheduled to have a liver transplant, but a company medical director said that he didn't think it was medically appropriate for this patient. She was 17 years old and a perfect match had been found. The family knew and the doctors knew that this was a covered benefit, transplants were covered, but that doesn't mean you're going to get it. For high ticket items like that, there's always a health insurance employee who will make the final decision as to whether or not you're going to get coverage.

I was always advised by the lawyers at my company, ""You never say that we deny care, but we can deny coverage for care."" There's no difference between that because most people, if you deny them coverage, most people don't have the funds and can't scare up the money to pay for your child's liver transplant.

In this case, the family raised such a ruckus and got such media attention focused on this case that my company capitulated and ultimately decided to cover the transplant but days passed, and when you're facing a situation like that, minutes count. Like I said, there was a perfect match of a liver found. It was waiting for the surgery to start when the family was called aside and the surgeon said, ""I'm sorry, we can't go forward because Cigna hasn't given us clearance."" So that's what more and more people are facing. That's not an isolated story, it happens day in and day out.

You recently said to Michael Hiltzik at theLos Angeles Times, a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist there, ""Health insurers have been successful at two things, making money and getting the American people to believe they're essential.""

It's true. I handled financial communications for Cigna for 10 years. Whenever the company would announce earnings or have any kind of financial news release, I was the guy that reporters from The Wall Street Journal and New York Times and anyone else would call to find out what it all meant. So I had to know how insurance companies, and my company in particular, made money, where the money came from, where the money went. So I learned that is absolutely true. They know how to make money, regardless of what laws and regulations are in place.

And I knew quite frankly, that when the Affordable Care Act was passed, even though there were important provisions in that law that restricted some of the practices that they were engaging in that were very common before the law was passed, that they would figure out other ways to make money because they have shareholders who have expectations of a certain amount of profit every three months. It's a short-term game. You have to demonstrate to your shareholders and Wall Street financial analysts that you are mindful of their needs… So that's job number one for them is to make sure that they're making money that satisfies Wall Street and their shareholders.

The other thing that I was in involved in and engaged in for years was ongoing propaganda campaigns to make people think that [private insurers] are essential. It's not just the insurance industry, but other corporations over many years have persuaded the public that the private sector can do no wrong, and that the free market is sacred and can work in healthcare as well as presumably in any other sector of the economy.

We have decades of evidence that it doesn't, but if you have the resources to engage in an ongoing propaganda campaign, you can persuade people, and you can turn people against policy proposals that would be in their best interest. I know that from having done it for many years.

How does a group like Business for Medicare for All go up against that?

First, by having some insider knowledge of how it works. I do, because another part of my job was equipping lobbyists with talking points, and making sure they had fact sheets and white papers to pass along to members of Congress, for example, to persuade them to see the world from our perspective.

To a certain extent, you have to play the same game, but we'll never have the same resources. They are able to skim off a certain amount of the premiums we pay every month to go to these propaganda and lobbying campaigns. So you're never going to be able to match them. To a certain extent, we're playing a David versus Goliath game here.

Being a nonprofit, we’re raising money that is helping us to be in the game, to help push back against the propaganda… I often say that some of the work that I do is to help inoculate people from the propaganda, to help them understand where it's coming from, how the language is developed.

… They keep trotting out the same kinds of language, like socialized medicine, like government-run healthcare, like a government takeover of healthcare. I know where these terms come from. I know how effective they are. So you've got to help people understand how propaganda works. It's not easy, but it is something that has to be done, to have a means of pushing out positive information about what we're proposing and to have a rapid response mechanism to push back against the propaganda. So that's what we're building.

We talked a little bit about the Democratic candidates and one of the things that has come up among some of them who are not as fully embracing of Medicare for All as others is the basic question: how do you pay for it?

Yes, and it's not something that you can answer in a soundbite. It's very easy to discredit a proposal with a soundbite, to scare people. My first experience in doing that was in the early nineties during the time when the Clintons were proposing to reform healthcare. I was part of a war room effort back then to scare people away from their proposals.

We're seeing the same thing played out now, as we have in the intervening years. It is a challenging one because if you're talking about something that switches to a system of publicly financed care, what does that mean? It means that you finance it through taxes. We've been conditioned to see tax as a four-letter word and to fear taxes. So it's the challenge for advocates, and that includes me, to help people understand that.

Consider what you're paying now, you and your employer or you and your union. Consider that a tax that's going ultimately into a private insurance company. You don't elect anyone. There's no accountability, no government accountability in a system like that, but just shift the way you think of what you and your employer are paying as a tax, and that keeps going up every year. In fact, the average cost now of a family plan that's offered by an employer in this country is over $20,000. It's an enormous amount of money.

We also kind of tend to think that our employers are giving their own money to the insurance companies, but that's not true. It's all our money. It's part of our total compensation. So that $20,000, instead of going to an insurance company would go into this single fund. So the “taxes” that you're paying to an insurance company will be taxes that will be going instead to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the Medicare program that we've had for more than 50 years.

It does require a shift in thinking and it is financed by taxes. [But] it's a much more efficient system. You eliminate so much overhead. So many of the administrative expenses that are associated and made necessary by a multi-payer system would simply go away.

I think in every one of the debates so far, one of the moderators has said, ""Well, how are you going to pay for this?"" It's a legitimate question, and it's a question that candidates need to answer and need to answer forthrightly… It will be a taxpayer supported healthcare system, but I think candidates are a little shy about trying to explain that…

You've got to spend a little bit of time explaining how that shift will occur. And that by moving to a single-payer system, you eliminate so much that is unnecessary spending.

We spend over three and a half trillion dollars a year on healthcare in this country, far more than anybody else. On a per capita basis, we spend $10,000 per person. It's $10,000 for every American, every person in this country, which is twice as much as the average developed country spends.

It's not because people are getting better care, [although] in many cases they are, it's because of the high cost of administering that's part of the multi-payer system.

The paperwork alone...

And it's not just within the insurance companies and their multiplicity of plans. Doctors and hospitals have to have teams of employees who do nothing more day in and day out but deal with various insurance companies -- trying to figure out what plan one of their patients is in, whether that plan covers and to what degree what the doctors say they need. So it's an enormous waste of resources. At least 30% has been proven to be spent on things that don't improve our care and in many cases set up barriers to care.

But what happens to those people who have those jobs, the people who are pushing the paper and working the computers -- what happens to them?

Well, keep in mind that a lot of the people who are working for insurance companies and for doctor's offices and hospitals are clinically trained nurses who've been hired to do this work. They’re no longer attending to patients. They're part of the administration.

Or they're denial nurses.

Exactly right. Rather than helping people get well, they are a barrier to care in many cases. I was doing some research on this a few years ago. United Health alone was hiring 10,000 nurses. They also employ doctors who are no longer providing care but are in administrative positions calling the shots, making decisions as to whether someone will get the care that an attending physician or someone's private physician says that a patient needs. In many cases, these people can go back into providing care. We have an aging population, a growing population, and we need to have more doctors and nurses. So a significant percentage of those can go back to providing care.

Others, the work that they do is not specifically and uniquely for the health insurance business. They have skills that can be used in other industries and other jobs. The legislation that both Senator Sanders has introduced and Congresswoman Jayapal has introduced in the House also provides funding, I think it's for a period of four years, to help people transition to new jobs. And for those who are in their 50s, it provides the assurance that they can have a continuation of income for a period of time.

It’s called Just Transition and union leaders who are supportive of Medicare for All have been involved in making sure that people who would lose their jobs or have to change jobs would be taken care of. A lot of the money that would be set aside would help with skills training, even relocation. If you have a pension at risk, that would be protected.

Would some of the money that would be raised through taxes to go into Medicare For All be used to convert for-profit facilities into nonprofit facilities? How do you keep someone who owns a hospital -- because I've seen it happen in my neighborhood and I know it’s happening in Philadelphia where you live -- from turning it into condos?

Frankly, that is an issue that has been debated… There has been a proposal that was not included in the House bill that would outlaw the use of federal funds going to a hospital or other institution that has a for-profit status. So for-profit facilities would continue to exist and they could, as they currently are, get reimbursement for the care that they provide.

But there is no magic bullet of a hospital being nonprofit. A lot of the nonprofit health hospitals in the country have closed as have some of the for-profits. The reality is that even the nonprofits largely have to operate like the for-profits do. There's not a heck of a lot of difference. They have different tax status, but in many cases, as we have seen with the University of Virginia scandal -- of that hospital system being very aggressive in collecting debts of people who've received care there -- they operate very much the same way. So just outlawing the use of federal funds that go to a for-profit facility sounds interesting and it has some support, but the reality is that nonprofits and for-profits operate very similarly. They call profits different names and in the nonprofit world, they refer to it as surpluses, but it's the same thing -- just doesn't go to shareholders per se.

You’re right about Philadelphia, the Hahnemann hospital that has been there for decades and has served as a safety net hospital for many, many generations is shutting down because it was taken over by a for-profit company and had a number of owner changes and the current owner decided, ""Well, this is not making money for us, so we're going to shut it down."" I'm fully expecting that before too long we'll see condos where that hospital was.

I was on a speaking tour of Tennessee not long ago and I heard about the rural hospitals that have closed there, and it's not unique to Tennessee, but it just happens that on a per capita basis, more have closed in Tennessee in recent years than anywhere else. A lot of those were operated by for-profit companies that were looking at shareholder interest more than anything else, not community need, and decided for the sake of the company it would be better to shut them down.

Some that have closed have been operated on a nonprofit basis but one of the things that’s important in the Medicare for All legislation, in the House in particular, [is that it] would establish something called global budgets for hospitals and other institutional caregivers.

It actually was something that was envisioned in the Clinton plan in the early nineties. There was opposition in the industry [and] there will be as we go forward in this debate, but what global budgeting does is it looks at a lot of factors to determine how much a facility should be a given in a certain year to continue serving the needs of the community – looking over a three -year period of time, for example, taking into consideration the demographics of the area served and making sure that that facility has an adequate amount of money based on recent history to continue providing services to the people who live in the area and depend on it. If you have a system like that, it would eliminate a lot of these hospital closures.

We talked about the Democratic candidates. We haven't talked about the Republicans. Especially since this current administration has been in office, we've seen a constant effort to completely eviscerate the Affordable Care Act. Until the composition of the Senate and the executive changes, how can we hope to see something like what you propose?

I can't predict when it will happen. What I do say is, I think it’ s not a matter of if, but when. Who controls the Senate and who controls the House, who controls the White House is a big factor. I don't think we'll see this enacted until Democrats are in control of both houses of Congress and the White House. Will that happen after 2020? I can't tell you. I think there's a good chance, a better chance certainly that we could make progress and get this implemented if Democrats do take control of the Senate.

If not, I think we'll be looking at a few more years down the road until we do see that change in control. Trump could be reelected. We just don't know at this point, [but] the current system is just not sustainable. We're seeing that the employer-based system is unraveling as more and more employers are unable to stay in the game and offer coverage. More people are earning a living in the gig economy and can't rely on an employer to provide coverage. Health insurers can't control cost.

When the Affordable Care Act was passed, we were spending about two and a half trillion dollars on healthcare in this country. Now it's three and a half trillion dollars. So you're seeing that the private system of insurance is not controlling healthcare costs. One of the aspirations, one of the goals, one of the things we need is universal coverage, but we've got to have our eye not only on that ball, but on what is a system that controls costs, because we simply cannot keep going the way we are. More and more employers are going to be throwing in the towel and saying, ""This doesn't work.""

I think it's conceivable that if there's another four years of Trump and Republican control of the Senate, you'll see further attempts to weaken, to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. There is this belief among a lot of Republicans that it needs to be removed. And some are living in some fantasy world that before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the free market was working or could work.

It would be catastrophic for the country if we got rid of [Obamacare, although] as the late Princeton economist Uwe Reinhardt said when it was passed, it’s an ugly Band-Aid on an ugly system, and that's what it is. It helped bring a lot more people into coverage, but you still have 30 million people who don't have coverage and many millions more than that who are now under-insured because of these high deductibles that they have to meet before their coverage kicks in, so it's not sustainable. There is a limit, and I know that employers are getting fed up with having to figure out how can they shift more of the cost of care and premiums to their workers. You can't keep doing that.

So you're hopeful?

Maybe I'm just an optimist by nature, but I'm also a pragmatist. One of the things that I am working to do in my organization is to – using a PR term – condition the environment to help make change more likely. You've got to persuade the public that what you're proposing is solid policy and in their best interest. It's not an easy thing, particularly when you've got a lot more money that's being spent to continue propaganda campaigns to keep people voting against their own best interest. But I feel an obligation to do this, Michael. Because of all that work that I did in my old job I’m making amends. So it's not just optimism, it's an obligation to do this, and to do what I think is the right thing, the right policy both from an economic but also a moral point of view.

So people reading this or listening to this, if they want to learn more about Business for Medicare for All, where should they go?

Go to our website, which is BusinessforMedicareforAll.org. Go there.

We also are launching Medicare for All Now, which will be a 501(c)(4). That will enable us to delve into the political work more deeply. We can endorse candidates and will be able to raise money. We have not endorsed a candidate for president. I don't know that we will in the primaries. We've got Senators Sanders and Warren who are strong advocates of “the damn bill” that Senator Sanders drafted and that has the support of several of his colleagues. As we discussed, not all of the candidates are on board with that, but we very well may weigh in, even in the congressional campaigns, so stay tuned.

Wendell Potter, thank you very much.

Thank you, Michael."

The second enrollment period at HealthCare.gov began Saturday, and so far, it's gone much more smoothly than the start of last year's first open enrollment, which was full of glitches and saw only a handful of people able to enroll the first day.

The Department of Health and Human Services said that on Saturday alone, more than 100,000 people applied for healthcare on the site, and more than half a million people logged on.

NPR's Elise Hu previously reported that the healthcare.gov users are seeing this weekend is a substantially faster, better website that it was last year:

Its load times have improved substantially, and the administration says it can handle twice as much traffic volume as last year. For customers shopping for coverage, you actually browse plans — get a sense of what they cost, check eligibility for tax credits ... and decide whether you want to buy.

Hu also found that the site has a new system in place to detect traffic overloads faster, and programmers from the Department of Homeland Security are trying to hack the site to make sure it's safe.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell went on NBC's Meet The Press Sunday and said the website works. ""I think the vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they were intending to do,"" said Burwell.

But she admitted that even as the number of Americans without health insurance continues to drop, and as more Americans began to take advantage of some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act, lots of Americans are still dissatisfied with the law.

""I think one of the things we need to do is translate that success,"" said Burwell. ""Because I think when you ask the American people about those things individually, or when you ask the American people about the importance of no longer being held off healthcare because of preexisting conditions, or the fact that their children up to the age 26 can be on their plans ... When you ask them about the substance of the issue, the American people respond positively. And that's what I think we need to do more about.""

Polling on the ACA continues to find that about half of Americans have negative feelings about the law, though people who enroll in plans through government exchanges are generally satisfied with their coverage.

Meanwhile, comments made by one of the architects of the law continues to draw criticism. Video recently surfaced of MIT economist Jonathan Gruber saying the ""stupidity of the American voter"" helped get the law passed. The Obama administration has already distanced itself from Gruber's statements, and Republicans are strongly condemning the remarks.

But that might be less of a problem for the ACA than the new Congress, which will have both chambers controlled by Republicans in its new term. Several members of the party say repealing Obamacare will be their first order of business."

Jan 28 2021,Biden healthcare order set to unravel Trump's legal fight over Medicaid,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-health-care-order-set-to-unravel-trumps-legal-fight-over-medicaid,"President Biden’s Thursday executive order on healthcare is set to unravel a Trump-era legal fight over Medicaid.

“There’s nothing new that we’re doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring Medicaid to the way it was before Trump became president,” Biden said before he signed the order, charging Trump with making the two “more inaccessible, more expensive, and more difficult for people to qualify.”

The order, which the Biden administration touted as an effort to “reverse attacks” on President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, instructs the Health and Human Services Department to open a special coronavirus-era enrollment period for people to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But it also compels other federal agencies to reexamine Trump-era policies regarding both the ACA and Medicaid, with the end goal of it being easier for more people to enroll.

The directive, along with an order reinstating federal funding for international abortions, signals a reverse of course on a legal battle Trump waged on Medicaid throughout his term. The fight came to a head in December when the Supreme Court accepted a case deciding whether states can impose work requirements on Medicaid eligibility.

Under the Trump administration, the practice was encouraged, and Arkansas launched a system where, to maintain eligibility for Medicaid, state residents would have to participate in jobs programs. The program, called “Arkansas Works,” inspired about a dozen other states to set up similar programs before it faced legal challenges, arguing that the requirements ran contrary to the point of Medicaid.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in February last year ruled unanimously against Arkansas, as well as then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar, finding the Trump rules allowing the program to begin did not take into account the fact that Arkansas Works could bar people from health coverage.

“Failure to consider whether the project will result in coverage loss is arbitrary and capricious,” wrote Judge David Sentelle in the court’s opinion, adding that, as a result of the program, more than 18,000 Medicaid recipients lost their coverage.

Both Azar and Arkansas Solicitor General Nicholas Bronni appealed to the Supreme Court in July. When the court accepted the case, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson praised the move, saying that the ability for states to impose Medicaid work requirements was one of “national significance.”

“It has always been our goal to provide healthcare to an expanded population of Arkansans while also providing tools for them to achieve economic stability and independence,” Hutchinson said in a statement.

But, given that the court accepted the case after Trump lost the presidential election, many legal scholars pointed out that a change in position from the incoming Biden administration could render the case moot.

“Like the border wall and ‘remain in Mexico’ cases, the timing of SCOTUS’s decision to take up these cases (which wouldn’t be argued until March) means that there’s a very good chance the Biden administration will moot them before they can be decided,” said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, after the case was accepted.

Biden’s orders expanding Medicaid and ACA also come as the Supreme Court weighs a Trump administration attempt to dismantle Obamacare entirely. In that case, the Trump administration argued that Obamacare was unconstitutional because it no longer carries tax penalties for those without insurance. The Republican-led Congress in 2017 had stripped penalties, without which, many on the Right argued, the law could not stand up.

The court is expected to decide that case this spring, and most observers, both conservative and liberal, agree that the court will not strike down Obamacare."
Jan 16 2014,Experts: Healthcare.gov's 'Fundamental' Data Security Weaknesses 'Alarming',Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/01/16/expert-hackers-could-wreak-havoc-on-healthcaregov-users-personal-computers-n1779957,"

Of all the shoes waiting to drop on Obamacare over the next year, one of the least-discussed is a damaging data security breach. We've seen a few troubling incidents crop up in various states, and an expert uncovered a major backdoor vulnerability to Healthcare.gov early on in the process -- but we haven't heard about any large- scale security meltdowns...yet, that is. Obamacare officials say the site recently passed a battery of security tests, but cyber security professionals offered a starkly different assessment to Reuters:

Advertisement





A group of cyber security professionals is warning that the U.S. government has failed to implement fixes to protect the HealthCare.gov website from hackers, some three months after experts first pointed out the problem. David Kennedy, head of computer security consulting firm TrustedSec LLC, told Reuters that the government has yet to plug more than 20 vulnerabilities that he and other security experts reported to the government shortly after HealthCare.gov went live on October 1. Hackers could steal personal information, modify data or attack the personal computers of the website's users, he said. They could also damage the infrastructure of the site, according to Kennedy, who is scheduled to describe his security concerns in testimony on Thursday before the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""These issues are alarming,"" Kennedy said in an interview on Wednesday.



So who's telling the truth? The administration says Healthcare.gov's security functions just received a clean bill of health. Outside experts say more than 20 deficiencies haven't been addressed -- and that they raised red flags about these issues in early October. Indeed, private sector authorities, hackers, members of Congress, and even some Obamacare bureaucrats have been pounding the table on these ""limitless risks"" for months. But how bad could these enduring weaknesses really be? This bad:





""The site is fundamentally flawed in ways that make it dangerous to people who use it,"" said Kevin Johnson, one of the experts who reviewed Kennedy's findings. Johnson said that one of the most troubling issues was that a hacker could upload malicious code to the site, then attack other HealthCare.gov users. ""You can take control of their computers,"" said Johnson, chief executive of a firm known as Secure Ideas and a teacher at the non-profit SANS Institute, the world's biggest organization that trains and certifies cyber security professionals. He declined to provide further details about that vulnerability, saying he was concerned the information could be used by malicious hackers to launch attacks...One security flaw that Kennedy first uncovered and reported to the government in October exposes information including a user's full name and email address. He said he wrote a short computer program in five minutes that automatically collects that data, which was able to import some 70,000 records in about four minutes. He said the information was accessible via the Internet and he did not have to hack the site to get it. He declined to elaborate.

He whipped up a rudimentary program in five minutes, let it run, and collected 70,000 records in the span of four minutes. But the government tells us everything is just fine. Tests were supposedly passed, after all. Many Americans will understandably trust the experts over the Obama administration, which has lied, dissembled and betrayed pledges over months of bumbling Obamacare incompetence. But if the data risks are so glaringly apparent, why haven't we seen a massive breach? Allahpundit reasons through three possible explanations: First, the site may appear to be vulnerable, but it's actually pretty secure. Re-read the last excerpt above and draw your own conclusions. Second, that the site is, in fact, vulnerable, but hackers don't want to cross the feds on something this big. But that's what hackers do. Some may be scared off by the world of hurt that would come crashing down on them if they get caught, but surely someone is willing to give Uncle Sam the finger and tap this treasure trove of personal data, right? Finally, he suggests that breaches have already occurred, we just haven't heard about them yet. Maybe the administration is suppressing information, or maybe they haven't even detected the problems. In any case, the lingering threat of identity theft will continue to hang over the Obamacare enrollment process like Damocles' sword -- and any forthcoming report about a big-time data exposure could deal yet another devastating blow to the program's tattered reputation."

Nov 20 2013,Obama Administration Maps Out Detour Around HealthCare.gov,HuffPost,left,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/19/obamacare-enrollment_n_4304818.html,"WASHINGTON -- People interested in buying health insurance under Obamacare could soon skip the HealthCare.gov website and apply for coverage and financial assistance directly with private insurance companies and online brokers, the Obama administration said Tuesday, in its latest effort to work around the faulty website.

Health insurers and online brokers like eHealth have always sought the ability to let consumers to apply for subsidies to cut their health insurance costs without using HealthCare.gov, the online portal to health coverage in more than 30 states. But technological snafus with the system linking insurers to the federal government ruled out that option, even as HealthCare.gov itself has remained problematic.

Now these insurance issuers and brokers are about to get what they want. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is close to providing insurers with the technological capability to also take subsidy applications, as well as sell plans to customers, spokeswoman Julie Bataille said during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.

""We've put in place a number of the most important fixes. This is something that issuers are going to look at within the context of their own systems, and I believe that, in the coming days, as they make their own assessments, they will make determinations about what may be appropriate,"" she said.

Activating the ""direct enrollment"" option would free health insurers and online brokers to accept applications from people who are eligible for subsidies, thus widening the potential universe of people who wouldn't need to use HealthCare.gov to get health insurance. Although going directly to a health insurance company or a private broker would mean consumers couldn't comparison shop for all available options, it would make it easier to obtain coverage for next year in advance of the Dec. 15 deadline to choose a plan that will be in place on New Year's Day. The full enrollment period runs until March 31.

Health insurance consumers have been able to purchase coverage directly from a carrier or an online broker all along, but these options were limited to people who weren't eligible for financial assistance, or decided to forego it.

At present, the health insurance exchanges, including those run by states and the federal government, are the only way to obtain the tax credits that are available to people earning between the poverty level and four times that amount, or about $11,500 to $46,000 for a single person. Obamacare enrollment so far has fallen below expectations, with just over 100,000 people signing up for health coverage during the first month of sign-ups, which started Oct. 1.

The Affordable Care Act already permitted direct enrollment for consumers, but the technology hasn't yet been switched on. And the feature likely won't be added to health insurance company websites right away.

""For subsidy-eligible consumers, we will continue to direct them to HealthCare.gov to get subsidy verification. We'll continue to engage in discussions about this issue,"" Lauren Perlstein, a spokeswoman for Health Care Service Corp., wrote in an email. Health Care Service Corp. operates Blue Cross Blue Shield companies in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. Other health insurance companies and trade associations contacted by email Tuesday wouldn't comment on Bataille's remarks or didn't respond.

Online brokers eHealth, Go Health and about 30 others also will soon have this capability, Bataille said. ""We believe that they are on track to begin their transactions as soon as possible. This is something that, obviously, they will make determinations about individually as they see how their system is interacting with ours, and they make their own assessments about the fixes necessary for them to begin their work.""

eHealth and other brokers forged agreements this summer allowing them to enroll exchange consumers, but they have been stymied by federal technical problems since the exchanges opened.

eHealth spokesman Nate Purpura said enrollment of subsidy-eligible consumers remains a work in progress. ""eHealth Inc. has been working closely with CMS to implement a technology solution that would allow us to enroll qualified individuals into qualified health plans through HealthCare.gov. We are still in the process of confirming that the fixes have been made that will provide a stable and consumer-friendly user experience,"" he wrote in an email.

The Obama administration has been looking for ways to facilitate sign-ups beyond the troubled HealthCare.gov, including paper and telephone applications for financial assistance. On Monday, White House press secretary Jay Carney said direct enrollment with insurers would be one of those means. President Barack Obama met with health insurance industry executives on Friday, following his announcement that state regulators and insurers could opt to renew policies that are being canceled as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

Obama said again Tuesday that HealthCare.gov would be working more smoothly for most people by the end of the month."
Nov 25 2013,Administration launches program to let users circumvent HealthCare.gov,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/11/25/administration-going-to-plan-b-on-exchanges/,"Trouble with the HealthCare.gov site appears to be so widespread that the Obama administration has opened the door for Americans to circumvent the site altogether.

Under a plan announced Friday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government would allow people to deal directly with insurance companies instead of through the federally run exchange website. The move comes as the administration's self-imposed Nov. 30 deadline for fixing the site is just days away, and officials acknowledge it may not be fully operational by then.

The pilot program announced by CMS would initially launch for residents in Ohio, Florida and Texas, and is the latest effort to give users an alternative to the troubled site.

“This is one more way we are working to offer consumers a variety of ways to enroll in affordable coverage,” agency spokeswomen Julie Bataille said in announcing the pilot project. “By strengthening the multiple channels to enroll in quality, affordable coverage … we are ensuring that every American who wants it can gain access to these new coverage options.”

Bataille said that direct enrollment has “been there from the start.” But the option was limited by the website problems, which have been fixed to the extent that insurance companies can now send applications to the site to assess enrollees' eligibility for coverage and potential discounts on premiums, she said.

Though the option could help Americans frustrated by the HealthCare.gov’s crashes, slow response times and other problems, it is another acknowledgement that the site probably will not be working for everybody by the administration’s Nov. 30 deadline.

Officials originally vowed to fix the site by then. As the extent of the site's problems became apparent, officials lowered the bar on that goal -- vowing instead to significantly improve the site by the end of the month.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that improvements to the site are on schedule, including faster response times, and that it should be able to handle 50,000 concurrent users.

""If there are more than 50,000 people trying to use the website, individuals can choose to receive an email from CMS when the traffic on the website has been reduced,"" he said.

Administration officials have also been encouraging Americans to submit written applications, contact call centers or visit sign-up centers to enroll for insurance.

They continue to say the site will be working smoothly by the end of the month for “a vast majority of Americans.” And last week, they extended the enrollment deadline from Dec. 15 to Dec. 23 to get insurance coverage starting Jan. 1.

Americans, who are required to have insurance under the president’s 2010 health care law, must enroll by the end of March or face a tax penalty.

In another development, GoHealthInsurance.com announced Monday that it has become the first private insurer to integrate with the so-called Federal Data Service Hub --- which includes IRS, citizenship and other personal information. So Americans can now use that as well to bypass the federal site and enroll in health plans under ObamaCare that kick in next year.

The company also said the process includes the capacity to calculate the subsidies.

As for the CMS announcement, Bataille said the pilot project will help improve the overall direct enrollment option because insurers and enrollees will provide federal officials with “detailed feedback on their experience.”"

By the end of 2013, more than 5 million people lost their insurance as a result of Obamacare making their plans illegal under the new law.

But that was just the beginning. Although President Obama has delayed the employer mandate to 2015, businesses are planning for the future right now.

Watch the latest video at video.foxnews.com

Healthcare experts estimate nearly 80-100 million private and employer provided policies will eventually be cancelled as a result of Obamacare.

Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute said that in addition to the individual cancellations, ""at least half the people on employer plans would by 2014 start losing plans as well."" There are approximately 157 million employer health care policy holders.



Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute added, ""the administration estimated that approximately 78 million Americans with employer sponsored insurance would lose their existing coverage due to the Affordable Care Act.""



Last week, an analysis by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, showed the administration anticipates half to two-thirds of small businesses would have policies canceled or be compelled to send workers onto the ObamaCare exchanges. They predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be canceled next year.

Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office released new numbers showing Obamacare will not only kill health plans, but millions of jobs too. Apparently, if you like your healthcare plan and your job, you can't keep either.

In an interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly before the Super Bowl on Sunday, Obama refused to admit that promising the American people they could keep their health plans under Obamacare was one of his biggest mistakes. Half of voters believe the president knowingly lied about people being able to keep their plans."

A series of congressional hearings leaves little doubt that’s true; in fact, one cyber expert even testified on the Hill yesterday, per Fox News, that the website’s security measures have only worsened over time. This three and a half months after the site launched, and millions of Americans typed in their personal information. Yikes. Good thing we have House Democrats telling us to be careful, and warning us about how truly awful the website is, or whatever.

Anyway, syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer predicts “a disaster” is on the horizon:

Charles Krauthammer told viewers Thursday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that security problems with the Healthcare.gov website are “a disaster waiting to happen.” His comments came just hours after three hearings on Capitol Hill in which a variety of experts testified that the site may be vulnerable to hackers. One witness even admitted the site’s security has gotten worse, not better. Republicans expressed alarm, while Democrats argued that the hearings were meant to create a sense of fear among Americans already nervous about guarding their private information.

And yes, this is only one of many problems plaguing the president’s health care law:

“It’s got adverse selection. It’s financially unstable,"" he said. ""Second, as we heard earlier in the show, there is no connection in the back rooms still between the healthcare.gov and the insurers. And lastly we have no idea who actually is enrolled a hundred days in. Add onto that lack of security, and you’ve got a problem.”

Re-read Guy’s post from last night. There are some eye-opening quotes in there from several experts discussing Healthcare.gov’s security deficiencies. He posits, too, three conceivable reasons why we haven’t heard really anything about widespread identity theft yet. Door Number 3 sounds about right.

What do you think?

Nov 13 2013,The right deludes itself again: It cannot do healthcare policy,Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/13/the_right_deludes_itself_again_it_cannot_do_healthcare_policy/,"I missed this when it posted nearly two weeks ago, so apologies for the delayed response.

It's a lengthy post by Reihan Salam defending conservative and Republican healthcare ideas from my characterizations, and my conclusion that conservative health policy would be far more disruptive than Obamacare is proving to be.

In a sense this dispute is academic and will remain so until conservatives both coalesce around a single alternative to Obamacare and develop a time machine so we can evaluate the Affordable Care Act and the Conservative Care Act side by side, pre-passage.

""Repeal and replace"" is a fantasy, but if it were genuinely feasible, Reihan would have to contend with the disruptive nature of both halves of the strategy. The earliest Republicans will be able to repeal and replace Obamacare is January 2017. I assume he'd concede that wiping Obamacare off the books three years from now and replacing it with anything at all would be more disruptive than putting Obamacare on the books in the first place.

So let's imagine for the sake of argument that this debate were taking place in 2009. We can introduce yet more clarity by distinguishing between conservative proposals and Republican ones.

Let's start with the former.

Reihan first takes issue with my characterization of conservative healthcare ideas -- the claim that conservative reforms would be vastly more disruptive, even if implemented slowly, and my claim that one conservative vision -- indeed the ur conservative vision -- for healthcare reform is to universalize (or nearly universalize) catastrophic coverage and pair it with a subsidy system to help people pay for non-catastrophic care.

I think both characterizations were basically fair. Where I said the right's response to Obamacare's disruption is to propose more disruptive, conservative alternatives but to ""rip the bandaid off slowly,"" I was referring to Ramesh Ponnuru's reaction to the cancellation row.

""The problem is that if young and healthy people leave their employer plans to get cheaper coverage on their own, those employers will either have to offer worse policies to their remaining covered employees — or have to drop their coverage altogether,"" he writes. ""The answer to this problem, I think, is not to abandon the idea of moving in the direction of free-market health care as an alternative to Obamacare; it’s to make that move in steps.""

It's not clear to me how small these steps would be. But the point is that once they're complete, the country's healthcare system would look much different than it did in 2009, and than it will under Obamacare's comparatively modest reforms.

If step one is ""flattening the [group market] tax break so it no longer rewards the purchase of the most comprehensive coverage available,"" then the first question is what the new group market parameters would be. Obamacare does something like this with a light touch, starting a few years from now; Reihan suggests conservatives would be somewhat more aggressive. James Capretta and Doug Holtz Eakin suggest a large minority of employer-sponsored plans would take a hit, forcing millions and millions of people into less generous coverage.

But details are crucial here. Do too much to equalize the tax treatment of group and individual markets, and you destroy risk pooling in group markets creating truly massive disruption. Work slowly and the disruptions would be fairly modest at first. But then we get to step two and beyond.

Here I'm cribbing from a couple of different sources.

Reihan:

[M]any conservatives have embraced James Capretta’s idea of a fixed tax credit which would be used as a foundation for coverage. That is, everyone gets the credit. Employers who provide employer-sponsored coverage would top up the credit as part of the compensation they provide their employees. Middle- and high-income individuals would top up the credit with their own money — by a little if they want low-cost catastrophic plans, by a lot if they want high-cost comprehensive plans. Medicaid-eligible individuals would top up the credit with a premium subsidy that would vary according to need, and that would be designed to limit out-of-pocket costs. (Keep in mind that the current tax exclusion subsidizes the cost of employer-sponsored insurance. It doesn’t cover the entire cost of comprehensive plans.) What is true is that young, healthy, non-Medicaid-eligible individuals who don’t consider comprehensive insurance coverage a good deal would be nudged towards catastrophic coverage under this approach.

More from Capretta: ""The Medicaid program would be substantially reformed. For the non-elderly and non-disabled, Medicaid eligible families would first get the new federal tax credit for insurance. States would then use Medicaid to supplement the tax credit to make coverage even more affordable for the lowest income households. The federal share of the revised Medicaid program would be adjusted so that combined federal costs from the credits and the Medicaid program equal what would have been spent federally without the reform.""

Ponnuru, with coauthor Yuval Levin, would tack on Medicare: ""Medicaid and Medicare would be converted into subsidies—essentially add-ons to the tax break or credit for coverage—for people to buy private coverage and pay for out-of-pocket health expenses.""

I'll spare you my normative assessment of these approaches, which I've admittedly sort of mooshed together, but there's just no denying they would be enormously disruptive. The Medicare and Medicaid changes speak for themselves. If young, healthy people are given an incentive to leave their employer plans, group markets would experience big premium hikes and untold cancellations. And without spending lots of money, or keeping some remnants of Obamacare in place, it would make the perilous experience of being a person with a preexisting medical condition a permanent feature of the healthcare system.

Reihan takes exception to my claim that the end goal for some conservatives is universal catastrophic coverage/health savings account model, which is how conservatives like to describe Singapore's (in fact highly regulated) healthcare system. And perhaps I'm overstating the constituency on the right for a start-from-scratch type of overhaul. But it's not a figment of my imagination. And even if the end point of conservative healthcare reform falls far short of the right's ""beau ideal,"" the question is whether it would shake up the system more than the Affordable Care Act does. I think it clearly would.

Remember, though, this is an approach, or mixture of approaches, favored by a subset of conservative intellectuals. On Capitol Hill, no Republican legislators of any consequence have endorsed anything like this, and generally don't favor expanding coverage beyond the pre-Obamacare status quo very much, if at all.

There's no leadership-backed Republican healthcare reform bill on the docket in Congress. But if you patch all the points of near-consensus together, the congressional GOP's healthcare vision is, roughly, to kick millions of people off of Medicaid, millions of people off of group insurance, millions, eventually, off of Medicare, encourage the creation of state-based, high-risk pools but provide only a fraction of the funds required to finance them, and degrade the already abysmal quality of individual market insurance for everyone who doesn't already have coverage. (If you like your plan, of course, you should be able to keep it.)

Most of this is indefensible. Reihan defends congressional Republicans specifically from my claim that they want to phase out traditional Medicare. But in so doing he misreads my position and introduces a small but significant historical revision.

Nearly all Republicans support Wyden-Ryan, and Wyden-Ryan does not envision phasing out what some are calling the Medicare public option. Rather, it envisions a transition to Medicare competitive bidding…. The Medicare public option is meant to be a permanent feature of the landscape, in part because it will have a significant advantage in rural areas. I don’t doubt that some Republicans favor eventually phasing out a Medicare public option (this was Ryan’s original position), but Republican voters tend to be older and many of them find the idea of phasing out traditional Medicare extremely unattractive, hence the GOP position has shifted. What Beutler seems to be saying is that competitive bidding might undermine the Medicaid public option. But he is underestimating the advantage the Medicare option will have outside of dense regions — in dense regions, it will be much easier for private plans to create low-cost narrow networks; in rural regions, it will be difficult if not impossible, and so the Medicare public option will probably emerge as dominant in Rural America. (The most sophisticated argument against Medicare competitive bidding is that it will increase costs as private firms game risk adjustment systems. Much depends on whether you believe that risk adjustment systems can improve over time.)

It's true that the most recent GOP budget preserves ""traditional"" Medicare as a public option. But just two years ago nearly every Republican on Capitol Hill voted for a complete phaseout of the program. The decision to reincorporate it was undertaken less as an accession to political reality and more as a public relations stunt designed to allow Republicans to claim their reform had Democratic buy-in. In truth, only one Democrat supports the Wyden-Ryan Medicare plan (Ron Wyden himself) and Ryan's decision to preserve Medicare as a public option was hugely controversial within the conservative coalition. Conservative lawmakers were deeply displeased. Philip Klein at the Washington Examiner articulated their grievances when he wrote, ""I fear this will prove a premature capitulation on Ryan's part.""

I'm sure some Republicans on the Hill would like absolution for their 2011 vote, but they can't unreveal the preference. Not all that much has changed since Newt Gingrich explained that the goal of conservative health policy is to allow Medicare to wither on the vine. And again, setting aside normative assessments, this would be highly disruptive.

The only way to portray Obamacare as similarly disruptive to either the conservative or GOP approaches is to argue that the marginal changes it will impose on some group plans are comparable to the cancellations and ""rate shock"" we're seeing on the individual market today. But if the ACA really were imposing similar burdens on people with employer-sponsored insurance, it's hard to imagine its polling would be holding as steady as it has been through the rocky rollout of its individual market reforms.

Part of the problem here is that the term ""disruption"" is highly subjective. But I think it's fair to assume that the truly burdensome disruptions of any hypothetical plan would be reflected in public opinion. And if that's right, then conservatives need to have confidence that their reforms would upon implementation enjoy a better mix of favorables and unfavorables than Obamacare does. There's just no way that would be true of the GOP patchwork, and it's a stretch to imagine it would be true of the conservative intellectual approach either. But it's hard to say conclusively.

The conservative blueprint is still largely blank. Once it's completely filled out, the real question will be whether implementing it while phasing out key elements of the Obamacare framework would be more or less disruptive than just tweaking Obamacare at the margins, letting it find its sea legs, and calling it a day. Like it or not, we can't go back in time and pretend conservatives were willing to be constructive reform partners after Obama's first inaugural. And it's hard to see how dramatically overhauling Obamacare would be less disruptive than making modest changes to it. But for a deeper look, I endorse everything that Austin Frakt writes here."
Nov 13 2013,Troubled HealthCare.gov unlikely to work fully by end of November,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/troubled-healthcaregov-unlikely-to-work-fully-by-end-of-november-as-white-house-vowed/2013/11/12/daf9670a-4bca-11e3-be6b-d3d28122e6d4_story.html,"Software problems with the federal online health insurance marketplace, especially in handling high volumes, are proving so stubborn that the system is unlikely to work fully by the end of the month as the White House has promised, according to an official with knowledge of the project. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The insurance exchange is balking when more than 20,000 to 30,000 people attempt to use it at the same time — about half its intended capacity, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to disclose internal information. And CGI Federal, the main contractor that built the site, has succeeded in repairing only about six of every 10 of the defects it has addressed so far.

Government workers and tech­nical contractors racing to repair the Web site have concluded, the official said, that the only way for large numbers of Americans to enroll in the health-care plans soon is by using other means so that the online system isn’t overburdened.

This inside view of the halting nature of HealthCare.gov repairs is emerging as the insurance industry is working behind the scenes on contingency plans, in case the site continues to have problems. And it calls into question the repeated assurances by the White House and other top officials that the insurance exchange will work smoothly for the vast majority of Americans by Nov. 30. Speaking in Dallas a week ago, President Obama said that the “Web site is already better than it was at the beginning of October, and by the end of this month, we anticipate that it is going to be working the way it is supposed to, all right?”

The need for what the official called a “divide-and-conquer strategy” for enrollment puts more emphasis on alternative methods for buying health plans. These methods include federal call centers and insurance companies that sell policies directly to customers — paths that are hobbled for now by some of the same technical problems affecting the federal Web site.

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

Julie Bataille, director of communications at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, said: “We are working 24/7 to make improvements so that by the end of the month the site is working smoothly for the vast majority of users. We are making progress, including fixes to reduce error rates and get the site moving faster.

“The challenges we are addressing today,” she added, “are a snapshot of November 12th, not November 30th.”

Meanwhile, pressure intensified Tuesday on the Obama administration to address the growing complaints of Americans whose individual insurance policies are being canceled because they do not comply with new government rules for coverage. The online magazine Ozy published a video interview with former president Bill Clinton saying that Obama must ""honor the commitment"" he made to Americans that they could keep their insurance — even if it requires a change in the law.

Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger said she and her counterparts in other states have offered suggestions to the White House on how best to address the problem of canceled policies. The most obvious solution, she said, would be to allow customers to renew policies early to let them stay in effect until November 2014. But that would come with a trade-off, she said: Those people would not receive federal subsidies for which they might be eligible if they bought a plan on the exchange.

She said that she and other insurance commissioners are trying to address consumers' desire to use the federal exchange. ""Honestly,"" she said, ""it's just a big mess right now. . . . I don't know what to tell people.""

Debate over how to respond to Americans who are irate about losing their insurance is intensifying on Capitol Hill. The House plans to vote this week on a bill introduced by Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) that would extend this year’s insurance plans for a year. On Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she is co-sponsoring a bill with Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) that would require insurers to offer 2013 plans on the individual market indefinitely.

On Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is set to grill several high-ranking administration technology officials about the problems affecting HealthCare.gov.

The software defects that ware making the Web site unstable with too much volume mean that some people face frozen computer screens when they try to enter information — and then get timeout errors, said the official with knowledge of the project.

Call centers have had problems, too. Within the network of 17 federally sponsored call locations staffed by more than 10,000 people, consumers are discovering that telephone representatives lack the authority to correct errors in online applications. And sometimes, consumers with more than routine questions are promised that specialists will call them back, but the calls never come.

Insurance companies, which have been pressing the White House for greater ability to sign up customers directly, are stuck at the moment, unable to complete enrollments. That is because they must connect with the federal online system to determine whether customers’ incomes qualify them for tax credits to help pay for their insurance — a part of the system that does not work.

According to the official, workers are trying to streamline the computer system so that it can handle outside queries from insurers and the call centers about whether people are eligible for subsidies. Technical workers are striving to have this part of the system working reliably within two to three weeks.

The work that remains to be done on the exchange is significant because the 2010 Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to have health insurance by Jan. 1. Under the law, the online marketplaces were supposed to be a central way for uninsured people who do not have access to insurance through a job to get coverage that is better and more affordable than most current individual policies.

In a telephone call with reporters earlier Tuesday, Bataille said that HHS is e-mailing about 275,000 consumers who have gotten stuck while trying to shop for and buy health plans. The e-mails encourage them to try again.

Asked whether the Web site could handle all those consumers if they logged on at once, Bataille replied, “That’s why we are sending this series of e-mails in waves.”

The CMS has said it has cut the waiting time for pages on the federal Web site from an average of eight seconds to one second and has reduced errors that have blocked consumers from 6 percent to 2 percent.

For some consumers, their frustration with the site has been compounded by their experiences with a call center. Lisa Chandler, 54, who lives with her husband outside Toledo, wanted to explore her new insurance options through the federal exchange. She had received a notice from her insurer that her health plan was ending and offering her a new one if she signed up by the end of this week.

After she was unable to complete an application on HealthCare.gov, she tried to contact a center three times and each time was told that a specialist would call back. No one did.

In Pennsylvania, Charles Roes­sler, 64, tried to apply three ways: online, through a call center and on paper. The retired computer salesman has decided on a health plan but hasn’t been able to sign up via any of the methods because no one has been able to verify his subsidy.

During his most recent attempt, on Monday, he asked a call center representative to delete duplicate applications but was told that the center lacked the authority. “We’re being told that you can go online or enroll through the call center,” he said. “Well, no, not really. . . . I’m just inches away from the finish line.”"
Oct 24 2013,"Firms behind HealthCare.gov to testify, spread blame to administration",Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/24/obamacare-site-fixer-no-amount-testing-could-have-prevented-disastrous-launch/,"The contractors behind the troubled ObamaCare website are planning to spread the blame around during highly anticipated testimony Thursday morning on Capitol Hill.

While Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is skipping the hearing in order to visit an ObamaCare call center in Phoenix, representatives from four contracting companies are expected to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. They are acknowledging problems with the site, but according to prepared testimony also pointing a finger back at the Obama administration.

A top executive with CGI Federal, one of the contractors paid millions to create the ObamaCare website, said the Department of Health and Human Services ""serves the important role of systems integrator or `quarterback' on this project and is the ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance.""

Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell also said in her prepared remarks that “no amount of testing” could have prevented the site’s problem-plagued start.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing is the first since the site’s disastrous Oct. 1 launch -- marked by crashes, slow response times and its inability to let customers make purchases. Contractors will likely face tough questioning from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, though the witnesses appear to be implicating government officials overseeing the project.

Prepared testimony from contractor Optum/QSSI blamed in part a ""late decision"" to require customers to register before browsing for insurance, which could have helped overwhelm the registration system.

""This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could window-shop anonymously,"" said Andy Slavitt, representing QSSI's parent company.

In her prepared testimony, Campbell argued that with a system “this complex with so many concurrent users, it is not unusual to discover problems that need to be addressed once the software goes into a live production environment.”

“No amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,” she adds, according to the prepared testimony.

Campbell said issues with HealthCare.gov have continued to improve over the past two weeks, but additional challenges are occurring as more users get past the registration screen and buy insurance -- including “data assurance issues.”

She said such problems can be fixed through “tuning, optimization and application improvements.” However, Campbell also said that the buck ultimately stops with the Department of Health and Human Services, which she said ""serves the important role of systems integrator or ""quarterback' on this project and is the ultimate responsible party for the end-to-end performance.""

The testimony comes as the Obama administration offered new details and explanations on Wednesday. The administration said the system didn't get enough testing, especially at a high user volume. It blamed a compressed time frame for meeting the Oct. 1 deadline to open the insurance markets. Basic ""alpha and user testing"" are now completed, but that's supposed to happen before a launch, not after.

The Health and Human Services explanation identified some bugs that have gotten little outside attention.

For example, technical problems have surfaced that are making it hard for people to complete the application and plan-shopping functions. That's a big concern because those stages are further along in the signup process than the initial registration, where many consumers have been getting tripped up. The problems are being analyzed and fixes are planned, the department said.

The explanation, posted online in a department blog and accompanying graphic, identified other broad areas of problems and outlined fixes underway but in most cases incomplete:

-- Unexpectedly high consumer interest that overwhelmed the system in its initial days. Equipment has been added to handle the load and system design has been improved. More fixes are in progress.

-- Lack of a way for consumers to browse their health plan options without first having to set up a user account. A partial fix is in place.

-- Incorrect or duplicate information in enrollments is being delivered to insurance companies. Some software fixes that should help address the issue have been completed, others are underway.

-- Difficulties for consumers trying to create user accounts, including drop-down menus that didn't work. Design changes and software fixes should address the situation.

On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee will line up contractors, including CGI Federal, the lead developer of the website, and QSSI, which designed a back-room operation known as the federal data services hub. The hub is integral to verifying applicants' personal information and income details, and the administration says it is working as designed.

For the first time in Gallup trends since 2000, a majority of Americans say it is not the federal government's responsibility to make sure all Americans have healthcare coverage. Prior to 2009, a majority always felt the government should ensure healthcare coverage for all, though Americans' views have become more divided in recent years...Republicans, including Republican-leaning independents, are mostly responsible for the drop since 2007 in Americans' support for government ensuring universal health coverage. In 2007, 38% of Republicans thought the government should do so; now, 12% do. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners there has been a much smaller drop, from 81% saying the government should make sure all Americans are covered in 2007 to 71% now.

A look at the trendlines:



Americans also remain overwhelmingly opposed to the imposition of a government-run, single-payer healthcare system, which very much remains leftists' endgame:



One thing that has not changed is that Americans still widely prefer a system based on private insurance to one run by the government. Currently, 57% prefer a private system and 36% a government-run system, essentially the same as in 2010 and 2011. Prior to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the percentage of Americans in favor of a government-run system ranged from 32% to 41%.



A few final notes: (1) Though Gallup's final likely voter poll prior to the election was off by four points, their registered voters numbers were pretty much spot on. In other words, their LV screen was too restrictive, but their overall data was sound. (2) Despite a heavily Democratic electorate on election day, a substantial plurality still supported Obamacare repeal, a result that mirrors stable polling trends. (3) For an idea of what a mind-blowing cluster Obamacare has already become, read this piece by Mary Katharine Ham. Deadlines keep getting pushed farther and farther back, and the administration has finally issued coverage rules for the state exchanges that are supposed to be up and running in a matter of months. These rules took 32 months to produce. An unmitigated mess."

Homeward, a healthcare startup, is using a hybrid model to pioneer a new way of patient care.

Rural America is home to 46 million people, yet since 2010, the region has witnessed 140 hospitals close.

Of the remaining hospitals, over 30% of them risk similar outcomes due to inflation and workforce shortages. Though more patients have turned to telehealth in recent years, startups looking to remodel rural healthcare want to tackle another piece of the puzzle — the area's shrinking healthcare infrastructure.

""Rural America is in the midst of a hospital-closure crisis,"" Dr. Rishi Wadhera, the head of Health Policy and Equity at the Smith Center for Outcomes Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard, told Insider.

He said these closures make the situation more difficult for rural doctors, whose patients ""tend to be older and have more chronic conditions.""

""While the growth in telemedicine will help address gaps in care for rural patients, we need to invest more in the healthcare infrastructure of rural areas, to ensure rural physicians have the resources and services they need,"" he said.

A hybrid healthcare model for rural communities

Telemedicine's rise in virtual-medical appointments not only enables physicians and patients to meet without risking COVID-19 exposure, but also increases access for patients who live far from hospitals.

Startups like Homeward Health are leveraging both in-person and telehealth models to support rural communities and their access to healthcare.

The company, which former Livongo executives founded this year, plans to use a mix of mobile clinics and virtual patient monitoring to simplify the healthcare experience.

Amar Kendale, Homeward's cofounder and president, said he knew the company needed a multifaceted approach to serve rural America. ""Technology helps with one piece of the puzzle, but given there are fewer and fewer hospitals and clinics, we also needed to address the infrastructure piece,"" he said.

To support the area's healthcare infrastructure, Homeward partnered with the retail-pharmacy company Rite Aid to provide mobile, on-site primary-care services at as many as 700 Rite Aid locations across rural America.

Kendale said Homeward's network of mobile clinics can make healthcare more convenient for rural communities. ""Now instead of driving 90 minutes to a hospital or clinic, which they don't do until they are in a medical emergency, residents can get their medical check-up and testing in the community,"" he said. ""We can become part of their routine so that when patients pick up their prescriptions, medical practitioners can also give them in-person care.""

While Homeward supports virtual follow-up care and ongoing telehealth check-ins, the company also wants to prioritize specialty care and early crisis prevention.

Heart-disease care is one focus for Homeward because of the disparity in treatment between rural and urban patients. Studies have found that when presented with similar symptoms at a hospital, rural patients are less likely than their urban counterparts to receive cardiovascular care.

Kendale said Homeward plans to include heart disease as part of its comprehensive-care model when they open their first mobile clinics in rural Michigan later this year.

Technology ushers in an old-school approach

Under the Homeward model, a patient suffering from heart failure would have already been diagnosed in a mobile clinic instead of the emergency room, when it could be too late. Through Homeward, the system would virtually monitor the patient's vitals, with the technology flagging the need for an in-home visit.

Kendale said new technology is bringing back medical practices from more than 50 years ago. ""It is reminiscent of the traveling doctor who would make house calls,"" he added.

In transforming the rural-healthcare model, Kendale hopes it will also change the roles of nurses, doctors, and other rural health practitioners. Studies have shown they worry about the quality of care they are able to deliver to their patients.

""Rural healthcare workers have seen their resources shrink, and so the burden has been falling on them,"" Kendale said. ""They have not had a lot of support. We hope this alleviates some of the workload and some of the burnout."""
Mar 29 2019,US Court Blocks Trump on Healthcare: 'End-Run' Around Obamacare,Newsmax (News),right,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/obamacare-trump-healthcare-end-run/2019/03/29/id/909242/,"A federal judge is striking down the Trump administration's highly touted small-business health insurance plan, calling it an ""end run"" around consumer protections.

The ruling Thursday by U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., is the second setback in a week for the administration's healthcare initiatives. On Wednesday another federal judge blocked Medicaid work requirements for low-income people.

At issue in the latest ruling are so-called ""association health plans,"" in which businesses and sole proprietors can band together to offer lower-cost coverage that doesn't provide all the benefits required under the Affordable Care Act.

President Donald Trump has hailed the small-business plans as a big success, but their impact is difficult to measure.

Unable to repeal Obamacare, as ACA is known, in Congress, the Trump administration has tried to use its rule-making powers to create room for alternatives."
Feb 27 2019,Medicare for All: House Democrats unveil bill to expand healthcare nationwide,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/26/medicare-for-all-house-democrats-healthcare,"House Democrats have unveiled details of their ambitious plan to expand a popular, government-run healthcare program to all Americans. The measure marks a fresh sign of the party’s growing support for a once fringe idea that will play a defining role in the 2020 presidential campaign.

The Medicare for All Act of 2019, to be formally introduced on Wednesday with 107 co-sponsors, would transform the American healthcare system from one in which millions of Americans are uninsured to one that provides universal coverage.

“The state of our healthcare system is absolutely atrocious,” said the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is introducing the bill with Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell. “How is it possible that the United States, the richest country in the world, is the only major country that does not guarantee healthcare to our residents?”

She added: “Americans are literally dying because they can’t afford insulin or the cancer treatment they need.”

The bill would establish a national health insurance program by gradually expanding Medicare – the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older – until it covered all Americans.

“Everybody in, nobody out,” Jayapal said, describing coverage under the plan, which she said amounted to a “complete transformation of our healthcare system”.

The bill does not include details on how the government would pay for the new healthcare system, which some studies have estimated could cost tens of trillions of dollars over the next decade.

Jayapal envisions major savings as a result of reducing administrative costs and inefficiencies in the current healthcare system. To pay for the plan, she suggested proposals such as taxing the rich at higher rates and mandated employer contributions.

A universal healthcare plan that moves the US closer to the systems in Canada and the UK has long been a dream of the party’s left.

A version of the legislation was first introduced in 2003 by the former congressman John Conyers of Michigan, but the idea began to gain traction when Senator Bernie Sanders championed the issue in his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. The year after, a majority of the House Democratic caucus supported Conyers’ bill while one-third of Senate Democrats signed on to Sanders’ version.

The plan comes amid a widening debate over how boldly to reform the American healthcare system, pitting progressives clamoring for Medicare for All against moderates pushing for smaller-scale changes. Several Democratic hopefuls have endorsed the idea of a universal healthcare system but are split over the details.

The plan has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate. But the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has promised to allow hearings on the bill for the first time, giving progressives a prominent platform to make the case for a single-payer system.

Supporters speak about universal healthcare as a moral imperative. They argue that millions cannot afford the rising out-of-pocket costs most are obliged to pay when insurance coverage is less than comprehensive.

Some Democrats, conscious that many Americans are wary of losing their current insurance options, are pushing for more incremental changes to the healthcare system, such as allowing people between 50 and 64 to buy into the Medicare system and imposing a cap on insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

Polling shows that a growing share of Americans, frustrated with the rising costs of healthcare, support a so-called “single-payer” system, where the payer is the government. Surveys have, however, found that support drops when respondents are asked their view if the program would result in higher taxes or longer waiting times for treatment.

But as momentum grows, so, too, does the opposition. Private health insurers, doctors and hospitals are partnering to oppose single-payer proposals, which could significantly affect their bottom line.

The Partnership for America’s Health Care Future has been mobilizing members to ramp up support for improving the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as opposed to repealing it, as Republicans attempted to do, or replacing it with a new system.

“Medicare for All may be a catchy slogan,” the group tweeted on Tuesday, “but it would do more harm than good for Americans who deserve affordable coverage and high quality care.”

Half of Americans have employer-sponsored health insurance. Polling suggests that they, by and large, like their plans and want to keep them. Others receive coverage through a patchwork of public health programs and private insurers.

Republicans, meanwhile, are eager to see Democratic 2020 candidates embrace the plan, confident it will help cast the party as too liberal and out of touch with everyday Americans.

Under the proposal, Medicare would become the country’s universal insurer. But the bill would also make significant changes to the American healthcare program, by greatly expanding the type of coverage offered and eliminating all deductibles, copays and premiums.

According to a summary of the legislation provided by Jayapal’s staff, the program would cover “primary care, hospital and outpatient services, prescription drugs, dental, vision, audiology, women’s reproductive health services, maternity and newborn care, long-term services and supports, prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse treatment, laboratory and diagnostic services, ambulatory services, and more”.

The transition to a Medicare for All system would happen over the course of two years. The authors know the bill has no chance of becoming law as long as Trump occupies the White House, but they hope to lay the groundwork for a future Democratic president. Activists are working with progressive members to help build public support for the plan.

“We will be pushing it as far as we can, as hard as we can, as fast as we can,” Jayapal said. “Enough nibbling around the edges. We really need to transform the system.”

Jun 16 2022,"US could have saved 338,000 lives from Covid with universal healthcare, study finds",The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/16/us-could-have-saved-338000-lives-covid-universal-healthcare-study-finds,"The US could have saved more than 338,000 lives and more than $105bn in healthcare costs in the Covid-19 pandemic with a universal healthcare system, according to a study.

More than 1 million people died in the US from Covid, in part because the country’s “fragmented and inefficient healthcare system” meant uninsured or underinsured people faced financial barriers that delayed diagnosis and exacerbated transmission, the report states.

The US had the highest death rate from the virus among large wealthy countries and is also the only one among such countries without universal healthcare. It spends almost twice as much on healthcare per capita as the other wealthy countries, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data.

“The current healthcare system in the US is economically inefficient and leaves millions of Americans without adequate access to medical treatment,” said Alison Galvani, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis at the Yale School of Public Health and the lead author of the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The authors recommend that the country adopt Medicare for All, a single-payer healthcare program, to “facilitate recovery from the ongoing crisis and bolster pandemic preparedness, as well as safeguard well-being and prosperity more broadly”.

To determine how many Covid deaths were potentially preventable, the authors built upon previous studies of the insurance gap and mortality rate in the US with data on how many people lost employer-sponsored insurance due to Covid-related business closures and restrictions that led to unemployment.

“While stay-at-home orders and temporary closures of nonessential businesses curbed the immediate spread of Covid-19 and prevented catastrophic demands on hospital capacity, the measures also led to spikes in unemployment,” the report states. “For employees, a layoff often results in insurance loss or the need to switch to a different type.”

The authors calculated potential cost savings from universal healthcare in part by reviewing the average Medicare and Medicaid costs for a Covid-19 hospitalization that required mechanical ventilation, which were $57,822 and $47,396, respectively, according to the report. The average charge to private insurance was $114,842.

The study also asserts that fear of losing health insurance during a pandemic might have caused people to still go to work even when they didn’t feel well.

“Universal single-payer healthcare is both fiscally responsible and morally imperative for the US,” Galvani stated.

David Rosner, who studies public health and social history at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, described the study as the “ultimate condemnation of a health system from a public health point of view”.

“It was clear that the essential workers who were delivering our food [and other items] to the middle class were being exposed disproportionately,” Rosner said. “I’m not surprised that they found that these folks were dying at a higher rate.”

A single-payer healthcare system could prevent such deaths because it would improve access to primary care, which would lead to quicker diagnosis of a virus and better treatment of co-morbidities such as diabetes, the study states.

Ann Keller, an associate professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, said the lack of a single-payer healthcare system is not the only reason the country has high rates of chronic diseases. She also blamed a weak welfare state, poverty and food deserts.

“But all other things being equal, if you provide people with consistent healthcare, they are better able to prevent chronic disease and or manage it once it’s present,” said Keller.

Recent Democratic efforts to implement a single-payer health system or expand the Affordable Care Act have stalled.

“Results of studies like ours are up against a Goliathan healthcare industry that contributes heavily to political campaign financing and lobbying,” said Galvani. “Legislators who sway under such influence are not working for the health or prosperity of their constituents.”"

Jan 12 2023,"NYC mayor cites slower economic growth spurred by high office vacancy, cost of migrant crisis and healthcare, in budget address",CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/01/12/business/new-york-city-eric-adams-budget-address/index.html,"CNN —

New York City Mayor Eric Adams unveiled the state of the city’s economic outlook as part of a $102.7 billion budget proposal for 2024 on Thursday, highlighting slow economic growth despite spikes in tourism and jobs.

Adams touted investments that will be made into public safety and affordable housing while promoting what he called “strong fiscal management.”

The budget proposal will be voted on by the city council later this year.

“We crafted this budget in the environment of economic and fiscal uncertainty. While our country has made an amazing recovery since the darkest days of the pandemic, the national economy has slowed as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to tamp down inflation,” Adams said on Thursday.

Office vacancy rates are now at a record high as the Adams administration points to the continuing slow pace of workers returning to the office since the pandemic shut down in 2020. The increase in vacancies weakens the commercial office market, according to analysis from the preliminary budget.

The Adams administration has also pointed to substantial fiscal challenges due to the migrant crisis, which they estimate is now at roughly 40,000 asylum seekers that have come into New York City since last April.

New York City’s share from a pot of $785 million earmarked for major cities struggling to deal with the migrant crisis won’t cover all the costs from dealing with the situation, according to the preliminary budget.

Rising health care costs and settling expired labor contracts are also listed as hurdles, according to the preliminary budget.

Despite the challenges, employment in New York City has grown 4.8% -— outpacing the state, which is at 3.3% and the United States as a whole, which is at 3.2%, according to the preliminary budget.

Adams said that 88% of jobs lost during the pandemic have been recovered, according to the preliminary budget.

The Adams administration also boasts $8.3 billion in budget reserves, according to the preliminary budget, which also looks ahead to investments in affordable housing addressing and environmental concerns.

Over the next 10 years, the city plans to invest $153 million into the development of Willets Point, transforming it from a gritty industrial zone in Queens into a bustling community with 2,500 affordable homes, a soccer stadium, a hotel and public space, according to the preliminary budget.

The city will also aim to enhance security measures at schools, investing $47.5 million on top of the already $30 million in capital funding to make technological upgrades to doors and entryways, Adams said.

The city has also earmarked $228 million for high-priority street reconstruction projects, $77 million for signal installation and $46 million to upgrade marine infrastructure in Manhattan and Staten Island.

“We are focused on governing efficiently and measuring success, not by how much we spend but by our achievements,” Adams said."

May 16 2021,Biden cancels Trump plan to ban immigrants who cannot afford healthcare coverage,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-cancels-trump-ban-immigrants-who-cannot-afford-healthcare-coverage,"President Joe Biden rescinded former President Donald Trump’s executive order that would have denied visas to immigrants who were viewed as a financial “burden” to the U.S. healthcare system.

SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS MIGHT SINK BIDEN IMMIGRATION PLAN

The White House announced Friday afternoon that it would not go forward with the Trump administration’s plan because it “does not advance the interests” of the United States. The move is the latest in a string of reversals of Trump policies and protocols to restrict both legal immigration and asylum-seekers, following Biden’s earlier decisions to halt border wall construction, increase the number of refugees admitted, and return to catch and release policies at the southern border.

“My administration is committed to expanding access to quality, affordable healthcare. We can achieve that objective, however, without barring the entry of noncitizens who seek to immigrate lawfully to this country but who lack significant financial means or have not purchased health insurance coverage from a restrictive list of qualifying plans,” Biden said in a proclamation reversing the order.

Trump’s order was put forward in October 2019, and it had ordered the government not to accept immigrants who could not prove they have health insurance or show that they could afford to cover medical costs if they became legal permanent residents."

Sep 10 2014,Healthcare Expert: Obamacare's 'Quiet Summer' is About to End in a Big Way,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/09/10/obamacare-still-unpopular-set-to-impact-more-americans-n1889347,"Dan wrote up yesterday's Washington Post/ABC News poll, which was jammed with crooked numbers for President Obama. Most striking was the (30/55) majority deeming Obama's presidency ""a failure,"" along with the prevailing opinion that he's divided the country, and his unsightly leadership score. The survey also included a dreadful (38/56) presidential approval rating on the implementation of Obamacare; support for the law itself was also underwater, with an outright majority opposed, despite this polling series' silly question wording that omits any mention of 'Obamacare' or the 'Affordable Care Act.' A new Kaiser Family Foundation poll produces similar findings, with support for the president's signature domestic accomplishment swamped by opposition. It's been this way for years, across hundreds of national surveys.



One major reason for the enduring opposition is that the law has violated virtually every major promise erected in dishonest ideologues' sales pitch. Another is that an ongoing parade of unpleasant developments continues to make headlines, including the recent revelation that Healthcare.gov was hacked last month. Apologists can cherry-pick useful data points to try to convince the public that Obamacare is reducing premium costs and driving down costs, but that's simply not the case. Individual market premiums exploded in 2014, and are expected to grow by roughly eight percent in 2015 (with many consumers confronting double-digit spikes) -- to say nothing of high out-of-pocket costs and narrow coverage networks. Overall health spending continues an upward climb. The law was billed as a dramatic premium reducer that would also bend down the so-called ""cost curve."" Healthcare industry expert Bob Laszewski is out with a must-read post on next steps for Obamacare. He argues that the law may have been largely out of the news for the last few months, but a fresh round of cancellations and the coming open enrollment period are about to change all that:

To say this fall's 2015 Obamacare open-enrollment has the potential to be problematic is an understatement. The HealthCare.gov backroom is not built yet––a year and counting after it should have been. How many people are enrolled in Obamacare? Without a government to insurance company accounting system yet built, no one knows. While the open-enrollment is now scheduled to begin until 11 days after the November election there will be plenty of renewal and cancellation letters going out in October––not the least will be more pre-Obamacare policies being cancelled this year now that their one-year extension is up––carriers aren't necessarily allowing policies to be extended further...Does this all sound confusing? Just wait until we approach the next open-enrollment with millions of people hearing about all of this complexity and having just four weeks to get their enrollment validated for January 1. The Obamacare anxiety index is going to be off the charts well before November 15th. Add to all of this bigger deductibles for 2015 (those go up with cost trend as well as the rates) and more narrow networks as well as generally larger rate increases for the plans that got the most enrollment and there will be lots to talk about...The last couple of months have been very quiet for Obamacare. That is about to end.

Large businesses expect to pay between 4 and 5 percent more for health-care benefits for their employees in 2015 after making adjustments to their plans, according to employer surveys conducted this summer. Few employers plan to stop providing benefits with the advent of federal health insurance mandates, as some once feared, but a third say they are considering cutting or reducing subsidies for employee family members, and the data suggest that employees are paying more each year in out-of-pocket health care expenses. The figures come from separate electronic surveys given to thousands of mid- to large-size firms across the country by Towers Watson, the National Business Group on Health and PriceWaterhouseCoopers, consulting groups that engage with businesses on health insurance issues. Bracing themselves for an excise tax on high-cost plans coming in 2018 under the Affordable Care Act, 81 percent of employers surveyed by Towers Watson said they plan to moderately or significantly alter health-care benefits to reduce their costs.

Click through for a thorough debunking of recent pro-Obamacare spin on ""baseline plan"" premiums, as well as a reminder that many new Obamacare consumers -- a significant percentage of whom have dumped their coverage -- will have to either change their plans again for face much higher rates next year. More upheaval is on the way. Numerous polls have consistently found that roughly twice as many Americans say they've been personally hurt by Obamacare than helped. Most consumers, however, have responded that they haven't been impacted one way or another. That, too, will be changing for millions in the coming months and years. The Washington Post reports Higher costs and reduced benefits are on the way for many who are among the the large majority of Americans receiving health coverage through their employers. And I'll once again direct your attention to this news package, which quotes a prominent Obamacare designer and supporter cheerfully predicting that 80 percent of employer-based plans will ""disappear"" within the next ten years:





An independent study cited in the piece projects that number at 90 percent. The White House knew this was coming, and Senate Democrats voted down a Republican effort to reinforce the president's ""keep your plan"" promise, which continue crashing down around consumers for years to come. Bottom line: Think the Obamacare mess is in the rear-view mirror, or that you've escaped its impact? Just wait. I'll leave you with one additional polling point:

Dec 07 2013,Ills of HealthCare.gov: Errors in ObamaCare website forms spark concerns,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/07/ills-healthcaregov-errors-in-obamacare-website-forms-spark-concerns/,"The Obama administration announced Friday that enrollment records for one in four Americans who selected health plans on HealthCare.gov in October and November could contain errors, raising concerns that consumers who think they have coverage won't actually be enrolled on Jan. 1.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille said recent fixes to HealthCare.gov have brought the error rate on forms sent to insurance companies down to about one in 10 for files generated after Dec. 1, The Wall Street Journal reported.

The electronic files, known as 834 forms, give insurance companies basic information about would-be customers, including their name, address, contact information and Social Security number. Insurance companies have reported issues with the files since the law's rollout.

""The new process put in place this week is making a difference. The enrollment files are getting better, but there is more work to do to ensure consumers are covered,"" Karen Ignani, the chief executive officer of insurance industry trade group, America’s Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement obtained by the New York Post on Friday.

CMS is reaching out to hundreds of thousands of consumers who have tried to enroll for health coverage but aren't enrolled, according to Bataille, who said consumers should be contacted by the insurance company for a payment after selecting a plan.

""Our clear priority is fixing any remaining bugs causing problems and working to make sure every 834 form past and present is resolved,"" Bataille said, according to The Journal.

Ms. Bataille said errors with the enrollment forms include duplicate files, lack of a file altogether, or a file with mistaken data such as a child incorrectly being listed as a spouse.

AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach told FoxNews.com last week that insurance companies have received duplicative and inaccurate forms, and ""in some cases, plans are not getting the enrollment files at all."" Getting that fixed, he said, is ""critical.""

Though the administration has given people until the end of March to sign up for coverage if they want to avoid a fine, coverage for many is supposed to start on Jan. 1. That leaves less than 30 days to fix the remaining glitches.

The administration announced last week it is working on a system to pay insurers its portion of premiums and cost-sharing payments. A temporary workaround has been proposed that would allow insurers to estimate how much they are owed, and submit the bill to the government.

Though the stock market is soaring and consumer confidence is high, Pence said, one thing that must be addressed right away is the implosion of Obamacare.

Obamacare is literally imploding. The average premium on the individual market has more than doubled since Obamacare went into effect, and in many states it's more than tripled. The Average Obamacare plan today costs $3,000 more than it did in 2013.

Pence expressed confidence that the Better Care Act would pass, though at least two GOP senators have said they will not vote for it.

“We're on the verge of a historic accomplishment here in our nation’s capital, because in the coming days, President Trump, working with the Congress that you helped elect, is going to keep our promise to the American people, and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. “Just two days ago, building on the good work of the House of Representatives, Senate leadership unveiled a new version of the Senate health care bill. The Senate health care bill is the right bill at the right time to begin to repeal and replace Obamacare, and to rescue the American people from this disastrous policy.”

Saturday night, Sen. Mitch McConnell announced that the bill would not be taken up in the Senate until Sen. John McCain returns to Washington. McCain had surgery in his home state of Arizona to remove a blood clot from above his eye and will recuperate there for the next week.

Last week, Pence told Rush Limbaugh that if the Senate was unable to pass this bill, they should pass a simple repeal then work on an entirely new plan."
Mar 08 2020,The COVID-19 outbreak has made universal healthcare into a national security issue,Salon,left,https://www.salon.com/2020/03/08/the-covid-19-outbreak-has-made-universal-healthcare-into-a-national-security-issue/,"Now, with the Democratic presidential primary field winnowed down, the two candidates really need to demonstrate some agility for the significant challenges at hand.

We have to hear stump speeches and debate exchanges that relate to the rapidly deteriorating facts on the ground in this country — and not get hung up on the histrionics of how we got here.The hour is too late, and the stakes get higher by the day.

Joe Biden's stutter, or what Bernie Sanders said about Fidel Castro, are all distractions from the very perilous 2020 American circumstance.

What the novel coronavirus has revealed in stark relief is the decrepit state of the nation's healthcare system decades in the making at the community level, where epidemics are either contained or left to decimate the local population.

By every measure, this most essential system upon which our biological well-being rests has been permitted to fall into the same state of ruin and disrepair that we see in our water systems, bridges, tunnels, rail networks, airports and schools.

That in itself is distressing enough. Yet sadly, there's more.

This hollowing out — of all of the most critical infrastructure upon which our day to day life rests— was done as we squandered trillions on a further notice global war on terror that only proliferated terror and set off the worst global refugee crisis since World War II.

This would not be histrionics, because right now we are spending several hundred billion dollars a year just to service the debt we racked up subsidizing multinational defense contractors who show their gratitude with tax avoidance.

And while our decades of disinvestment in public health has us now scrambling to improvise an effective coronavirus response, the Trump and the GOP tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans accelerated wealth concentration and sunk the government deeper into debt.

Meanwhile, America's rural and urban hospitals were being decimated, thanks to the predations of a profit driven health care system and the refusal of Republican governors to act on the 2014 opportunity under the Affordable Health Care Act to expand Medicaid for millions of low-income households.

Talk about rationing care.

As Oliver Millman recently reported in the Guardian, ""hospital closures in rural areas of the US hit their highest point in the past decade last year, with 19 rural hospitals shutting down"" with ""34 facilities shuttering in the past 24 months.""

Since 2010, 120 hospitals in rural states like Texas (20), Tennessee (17), Oklahoma (7), and Georgia (7) have fared the worst.

What Millman's analysis found was that hospitals were much more likely to face closure in states with spiteful GOP governors, driven by Tea Party ideology, who refused to expand Medicaid the hospitals.

""Using a model that shows risk factors for hospitals, the report found that 453 rural hospitals across the US are vulnerable to closure,"" the Guardian reported. ""Being in a state that has accepted expanded Medicaid help decreases the likelihood of closure by 62 percent on average, according to the analysis.""

But rural America is not the only place where the backlash against Obamacare and Wall Street driven predators are closing hospitals and leaving poorer communities vulnerable to something like the novel coronavirus.

According to the Health Care Financial Management Association, in 2017, the first year of Trump's presidency, 16 hospitals closed. Last year, that number reached 47. This system is in free fall, and it is not in the interest of corporate media to tell us just how marginal the whole system has become.

In a vivid piece last summer for US News & World Report entitled ""Code Red: The Grim State of Urban Hospitals"", Joseph Williams chronicled the efforts on labor and community activists to try and keep Hahnemann University Hospital in downtown Philadelphia open.

He wrote the 178-year-old hospital, that serves primarily people of color, ""has a mandate that's rarely advertised but widely understood, especially in poor neighborhoods: Treat everyone who walks through its doors, the indigent as well as the insured.""

He continued: ""That egalitarian mission led to some 150 patients treated in its emergency room per day – including many who don't have a medical emergency, but lack insurance and can't afford a primary care doctor. It also led to a financial balance sheet featuring $3 million a month in losses – brutal numbers that would make any executive reach for the antacids.""

The Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals, along with community advocates and Sen. Bernie Sanders, described the closure as creating ""a public health emergency triggered by corporate greed and a dysfunctional, profit-driven health care system.""

In the process, the corporate bankruptcy created a health care desert, assuring that the rest of the city's crowded emergency departments ""increasing wait times and putting patients hurt in a car crash or suffering from a stroke at greater risk of dying.""

The essential community asset was also a teaching hospital for Drexel University of Medicine and St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.

In January 2018, American Academic Health LLC, an affiliate of Paladin Health Care, completed the transaction they had initiated the year before.

""We are thrilled and proud to be the new owners of these venerable Philadelphia hospitals and the outstanding clinical and academic programs for which they are recognized,"" said Joel Freedman, American Academic's Founder and Chief Executive Officer.

In a year and a half, American Academic Health's local Philadelphia affiliate filed for bankruptcy.

In the process, the health care profit vulture's bankruptcy upended the career of 570 medical students, including 55 medical residents in the U.S. reliant on J-1 cultural exchange visas who faced potential deportation.

Hopefully these aspiring physicians hung on and landed on their feet and in their lab coat.

We are going to need every one of them.

The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that by 2032 we could be short as many as 121,900 primary and specialty care doctors. An even greater shortage is already upon us for nurses.

As we see with the global coronavirus scramble for surgical masks, capitalism is all about feeding off scarcity.

We know that we spend more on health care than the other 35 nations that make up the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development with not much to show for it in terms of health care outcomes.

""The United States spends more on healthcare than any other OECD country, both as a proportion of GDP (16.9 percent) and per person (USD 10 586). Spending is expected to increase with healthcare as a proportion of GDP forecast to reach 20 percent by 2030,"" according to the OECD. ""High levels of spending have not translated into people leading longer lives. Life expectancy at birth is two years below the OECD average, and actually declined by over two months between 2012 and 2017.""

So far, the debate facilitated by the corporate news media on health care has been framed as a question of whether or not Americans were in favor of universal health care or wanted to hold on to their private plan, assuming they have one.

What the coronavirus crisis has revealed is just how delusional this debate has been. The reality is the whole architecture is inadequate to face the public health challenges upon us.

Hence, universal health care is no longer a talking point. It is a national security imperative."
Mar 24 2017,Trump calls out Republicans on abortion to try to sway healthcare vote,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/24/trump-freedom-caucus-abortion-healthcare-planned-parenthood,"The White House claimed talks between Donald Trump and House speaker Paul Ryan were ongoing on Friday as the Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act stood on the verge of defeat.

Earlier the White House had insisted there would be a vote at 3.30pm, but moments after that deadline slipped by, reports began to emerge that Trump had asked for the vote to be pulled. Ryan was due to hold a press conference at 4pm.

“They are continuing to discuss the way forward on this,” the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said of the meeting. “The speaker is updating him on his efforts.”

Spicer said Trump had been calling House members from early in the morning to late at night to lobby for the legislation and insisted that the president “left everything on the field when it comes to this bill”.

He said: “The question is can we get to 216 [votes]? But make no mistake about it, the president made clear last night that this is it.”



A downbeat Spicer added: “At some point you can only do so much ... We are confident that we have done everything and it’s now up to the voters [in Congress] ... And I think that now’s the time for the vote.”

Asked if the buck stopped with Trump, the author of the Art of the Deal who predicated his presidential run on his negotiating skills, the press secretary replied: “You can’t force someone to vote a certain way.”

Trump started the day by employing an unconventional negotiating strategy – mocking conservatives for being insufficiently anti-abortion.

“The irony is that the Freedom Caucus, which is very pro-life and against Planned Parenthood, allows P.P. to continue if they stop this plan!” Trump tweeted, referring to the hard-right group of conservative legislators.

The American Health Care Act includes a provision to defund the women’s health organization, which has long been a bête noire for conservatives opposed to abortion rights who strongly object to taxpayer money going to an organization that performs abortions.

Prior to his run for president as a Republican, Trump described himself as “very pro-choice”. Even on the campaign trail, he went out of his way to praise Planned Parenthood, saying that the organization had done “very good work for millions of women”.

Freedom Caucus members, who held a late-night meeting Thursday on Capitol Hill to plot their strategy, were skeptical of the AHCA on the grounds that it left too much of the architecture of the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, in place. However, they won one major victory on Thursday when they were able to add a provision removing the federal mandate for “essential health benefits” in the bill and letting states decide which health benefits were essential. Under the current law, all health insurance plans are required to cover these 10 services, including maternity care, mental health, prescription drugs and both inpatient and outpatient care.

This concession helped to win over hesitant conservatives, including some members of the Freedom Caucus.

But a number of conservatives remain dissatisfied, while at the other end of the spectrum, some Republican moderates believe the legislation goes too far and would result in too many people losing their health coverage. A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2026 if the AHCA passes.

Twenty-two Republican defectors would be enough to lead to the AHCA failing in the House. No Democrats are expected to vote for the bill.

Republican Mark Amodei of Nevada, an opponent of the bill, saw this number as being relatively easy to reach. “You’re going to get some noes out of the Freedom Caucus, get some noes out of those 59 people elected in Hillary Clinton-voting districts, and then you have some of the people in the middle and we don’t fit into any label and I think you’re going to get some of those too,” said Amodei.

He noted “that doesn’t require a lot of noes from each [group]”, adding that 22 “doesn’t seem like a monster number”.

Among the Republicans opposing the bill is Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey, who is the chair of the House appropriations committee. It is almost unprecedented in recent congressional history for such an important figure to oppose the House speaker on a major legislative priority.

The bill is politically risky: although recent polling from Quinnipiac University showed that a majority of Americans wanted at least some changes to Obama’s health law, it also pegged current support for the AHCA among voters at only 17%.

Democrats seemed eager to use the vote for political leverage in midterm elections. The House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, predicted in a press conference on Friday: “The people who vote for this will have this vote tattooed to their foreheads as they go forward. They have to answer for the vote.” Already, on Friday, a number of Republicans in competitive districts announced they were voting no including Barbara Comstock, who represents a swing Virginia district just outside Washington.

But the blame game was also being played on the other side of the aisle.

Amodei complained to reporters that his caucus “didn’t spend a lot talking about a unified Republican vision for what we should do with healthcare in the House”, while Paul Gosar, a member of the Freedom Caucus, pointed a finger at White House staff.

“We need to get this across the finish line, but [Trump’s] relying a lot on his staff,” Gosar said. Further, sources close to the White House have been pushing the blame on Paul Ryan in discussons with reporters from several outlets.

Democrats took their own lessons. The House minority whip, Steny Hoyer, told reporters that Republicans “find themselves in this position because they have now for a very long period of time said to themselves that they don’t want to include Democrats”."
Apr 12 2021,Chilling Texan bill defines parents of trans kids consenting to healthcare as ‘child abusers’,PinkNews,left,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/04/12/texas-trans-kids-senate-bill-1646-parents-healthcare-child-abuse-doctors-for-change/,"A chilling new bill in Texas would define the parents of trans kids who consenting to their affirming healthcare as “child abusers”.

Texas Senate Bill 1646 was filed on 11 March, 2021, and is sponsored by 13 Republican state senators.



The bill states that a person will be considered guilty of child abuse by “consenting to or assisting in the administering or supplying of, a puberty suppression prescription drug or cross-sex hormone to a child, other than an intersex child, for the purpose of gender transitioning or gender reassignment” or “performing or consenting to the performance of surgery or another medical procedure on a child, other than an intersex child, for the purpose of gender transitioning or gender reassignment”.

The bill places Texas parents consenting to gender-affirming care for their trans kids alongside those who create child porn, sexually abuse children, give illegal drugs to children and those who facilitate forced child marriages.

Penalties for child abuse in Texas include jail time, fines, and removal of the child.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) staff attorney Chase Strangio wrote on Twitter: “This bill in Texas, SB1646, would remove trans kids from their homes if a parent affirms their gender. Truly barbaric.”

This bill in Texas, SB1646, would remove trans kids from their homes if a parent affirms their gender. Truly barbaric.— Chase Strangio (@chasestrangio) April 12, 2021

The bill had its first hearing on Monday (12 April), and was referred to the Senate State Affairs Committee. A date has not yet been scheduled for its first public hearing.

In response, the Texas charity Doctors For Change wrote an open letter to state senator Bryan Hughes, who chairs the Senate State Affairs Committee, condemning the bill and its implications for both parents and healthcare providers.

It wrote that its “more than 1,000 healthcare provider members… vehemently oppose SB1646”.

The letter continued: “We care for Texans of all ages, including transgender and non-binary children, youth, and adults, and we are appalled by the blatant intention of SB1646 to characterise the provision of our compassionate, evidence-based care as ‘child abuse’ and to levy criminal penalties against providers who are putting the health and wellbeing of patients first, as is our duty to do, as well as parents/ guardians who are properly ensuring their children receive necessary care.”

The group also pointed out that because of mandatory reporting of child abuse, the bill would “mandate any healthcare provider report minors receiving certain care which would irreparably damage the trust and confidentiality of patient-provider relationships”.

Doctors For Change said it “strongly urged” committee members to reject the “harmful” bill."
Oct 07 2015,How the debate over healthcare is changing - just in time for the 2016 election,Los Angeles Times,left,http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-politics-healthcare-campaign-20151007-story.html,"A supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton holds up a sign as Clinton speaks on Oct. 2, 2015, in Davie, Fla.

With the first primaries of the 2016 presidential campaign just months away, the national healthcare debate is poised to enter a new phase, more focused on consumers’ pocketbooks than on re-litigating the 5-year-old Affordable Care Act.

Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is campaigning on a detailed program to crack down on rising drug prices and runaway medical bills, is making a play for the hearts of voters increasingly irritated about what they have to pay for healthcare.

In the process, Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has issued an implicit challenge to her Republican rivals, who continue to campaign with broadsides against Obamacare but few details about how they would address consumers’ basic healthcare worries.

“She is talking to people’s wallets … at a time when healthcare prices are a huge concern,” said Frank Luntz, an influential Republican strategist who helped develop the GOP’s highly successful campaign to tarnish Obamacare even before the law was enacted. “It’s smart.”

Clinton is highlighting her healthcare plans on a two-day swing through Iowa. “We have to be really focused on how we fix what we have so it works better for everyone,” she told a crowd in Davenport on Tuesday.

Clinton’s proposals may not resonate with the many Americans leery of more promises from the federal government, especially after President Obama pledged similar relief when he signed the current law in 2010. But the former first lady has focused attention on an agenda that, polls suggest, Americans want their elected leaders to take on.

Making high-cost drugs affordable should be the top healthcare priority for the next president and Congress, three-quarters of Americans said in a nationwide survey this year.

Most Americans also want their elected leaders to protect them from surprise out-of-network medical charges. They want government to ensure health plans have sufficient networks. And they want more information about the prices of doctors’ visits, tests and procedures, according to the poll, by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

By contrast, fewer than half the respondents want their elected officials to deal with concerns about the Affordable Care Act. Just a third want it fully repealed.

“Health is really a pocketbook issue more than a political issue now,” foundation President Drew Altman said.

The evolution may reflect in part Republicans’ waning repeal campaign.

Five-and-half years after its enactment, the law has survived two major legal challenges and three national elections. And, contrary to opponents’ warnings, it has extended coverage to millions of Americans without destroying the existing employer-based system that most in the U.S. rely on for health insurance.

But another factor is likely driving Americans’ concerns about drug prices and medical costs.

Over the last decade, the average deductible that workers must pay for medical care before their insurance kicks in has more than tripled from $303 in 2006 to $1,077 today, according to a recent report on employer-provided coverage from the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust.

That is seven times faster than wages have risen in the same period.

At the same time, nearly a third of Americans with private health insurance have received a bill in which they were charged more than they had expected to have to pay, a recent nationwide Consumer Reports survey showed.

In response, Clinton is proposing a series of new restrictions on insurers and drug makers.

Among other things, she would put a $250 monthly cap on how much consumers could be required to pay out of pocket for medications. She would allow consumers to buy pharmaceuticals abroad, where they are often substantially cheaper.

Clinton also would create a new tax credit that Americans could use to help defray their out-of-pocket medical bills.

Insurers would be required to cover at least three doctor visits annually that aren’tsubject to a deductible.

And doctors who are providing care at a hospital that is in-network would be prohibited from charging patients out-of-network prices.

Clinton is also pushing broader policies to clamp down on the pharmaceutical and insurance industries, including restrictions on drug advertising and new federal oversight of insurance rate hikes. She would also allow the federal government to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries, something that could save billions of dollars but is currently prohibited.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent challenging Clinton for the Democratic nomination, is proposing his own six-point plan for reducing drug prices, including allowing the federal government to negotiate Medicare drug discounts.

NEWSLETTER: Get the day’s top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>

Some experts have dismissed parts of Clinton’s agenda as unrealistic, especially her proposal to require drug makers to spend more on research.

But this kind of consumer-focused agenda holds great promise for Democrats who’ve been paralyzed by the GOP’s long campaign against the Affordable Care Act, said Celinda Lake, a veteran party strategist. “This is a post-Obamacare message … that has something for the insured, as well as the uninsured,” she said.

In contrast, none of the leading GOP candidates has a healthcare plan, though Florida Sen. Marco Rubio published a Fox News opinion piece in March calling for broad changes to the healthcare system, including deregulation of insurance markets to lower costs.

The most detailed healthcare plan in the Republican field was put forward by former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker; he dropped out of the race two weeks ago.

Despite the lack of specifics, the GOP’s simple anti-government, anti-Obamacare message still resonates with large swaths of the electorate, however.

Although huge majorities of Americans complain about drug prices, for example, substantially fewer support government intervention.

In one recent national survey from market research firm YouGov, 86% of respondents said drug prices were either “far too high” or “a little too high,” yet only 50% said they would support “the federal government controlling the price of prescription drugs.”

Deeper into the CNN survey are some issue-specific questions that illustrate how far out of the mainstream many of the Democrats running for president have become. Last Thursday evening, NBC moderators asked all ten candidates how many of them would cover illegal immigrants in their healthcare plans. Ten out of ten raised their hands in the affirmative. This is a view shared by slightly over one-third of the US population (with the 'yes' respondents likely heavily concentrated in California and New York:

New CNN poll: 58% of Americans OPPOSE free healthcare for illegal aliens.



This should surprise nobody. The Democrats are radically extreme & don't represent the vast majority of people in our country.https://t.co/tMLlvubxIq — Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) July 1, 2019

The poll released Monday found 58% of Americans oppose giving government-backed healthcare to illegal immigrants while 38% say they support giving healthcare to illegal immigrants. All 10 of the Democratic candidates on the second night of the debate raised their hands to say they supported giving healthcare to illegal immigrants. The debate included Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Kamala Harris, and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

On the question of eliminating private insurance coverage and forcing the entire population into a single-payer government system, the results are even bleaker for the Left:

CNN poll shows just 21% support completely replacing private health insurance with a national program. (Most in favor of single-payer want to allow private coverage.)



People also oppose coverage for undocumented immigrants, 59-38. All 10 Dems at Thursday's debate supported that. — Aaron Blake (@AaronBlake) July 1, 2019



Only about one-in-five voters favor bills endorsed by nearly half of House Democrats, and most of the US Senators running for president, that would make private coverage illegal. This would cancel and eliminate the plans of roughly 180 million Americans. Even among Democratic voters, a large majority of whom want a new national healthcare program, 'BernieCare' is unpopular:

Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris support taking away the health insurance plans of 180 million Americans, but CNN reports that even half of Democrats are opposed to such a proposal. Just shows how extreme they really are! pic.twitter.com/C4LhtdR1Gs — Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) July 1, 2019



Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren all support this massive upheaval. And as I've mentioned, other contenders like Pete Buttigieg and Kirsten Gillibrand have stated openly that even supposedly moderate approaches on 'Medicare For All' would be intended to drive private insurance out of business, forcing everyone into a government system. In the next debate, I'd love to see more 'show of hands' questions on Nike booting the American flag, taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgeries, and federally-mandated school busing."
Nov 19 2013,Private consultants warned of risks before HealthCare.gov's Oct. 1 launch,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/private-consultants-warned-of-risks-before-healthcaregovs-oct-1-launch/2013/11/18/9d2db5f4-5096-11e3-9fe0-fd2ca728e67c_story.html,"The report was provided to The Washington Post by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

This risk assessment, which was encapsulated in a 14-slide presentation, was delivered to senior White House and Department of Health and Human Services officials in four briefings between March 28 and April 8, the committee said.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius; Marilyn Tavenner, then acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); and White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park attended a session about the report on April 4 at HHS headquarters. Obama health policy adviser Jeanne Lambrew and then-White House Deputy Chief of Staff Mark Childress received a briefing April 8 at the White House.

Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.), who chairs the panel’s subcommittee on oversight and investigations, said the presentation suggests that, in the run-up to its fall debut, the enrollment system was more troubled than administration officials have let on.

“Despite assurances from Secretary Sebelius, Marilyn Tavenner and [CMS official] Gary Cohen that all was well and on track with the launch of the Affordable Care Act, we now have documents dating back to April that call into question the assertions made to this committee,” Murphy said.

The CMS said in a statement that the McKinsey assessment was “part of a standard process to identify potential risks and develop mitigating strategies.” It added that “the review was completed six months before the beginning of open enrollment, was in line with industry best practices and was followed by concrete action to address potential risks — as was intended.”

White House spokesman Eric Schultz said ""flags were definitely raised throughout the development of the Web site, as would be the case for any IT project this complex. . . . But nobody anticipated the size and scope of the problems we experienced once the site launched.""

Administration officials noted that the assessment was not a technical review of the Web site’s functionality. They said a number of the recommendations were acted upon, including stepping up communication with states and funneling more resources to in-person helpers and the call center.

Advertisement

The document did not predict whether the project’s problematic design stage would hamper its rollout but instead made it clear that programs of this scale are ideally pursued in a more orderly process, with “significant testing and revision” before they launch.

Some of the concerns raised did not come to pass. For example, the report cited the “data hub” — the massive network that connects federal, state and insurer databases — as a vulnerability. Officials say the data hub has been working well since the launch.

In addition, the report warned of long call-center wait times. Wait times were down to two minutes a few days after the launch, and they are now just seconds.

But with many of the project’s shortcomings now glaringly obvious, the report appears prescient in other respects.

One slide notes that the policy and requirements of a program are best defined at the outset, leaving sufficient time for testing and revision. By contrast, McKinsey noted, the federal marketplace’s design was marked by “evolving requirements” that shifted throughout the design phase, leaving scant time to test the system before its launch.

Advertisement

It also warned that the federal government largely depended on contractors to construct the marketplace, and that it lacked an overall “end-to-end operational view” of the system to ensure that its different parts worked well together.

Federal officials asked McKinsey to lay out how the consumer experience was likely to unfold over the first year based on the existing trajectory of the project and to identify things that might go wrong. The firm reviewed more than 200 documents and sources, and interviewed about 40 people across a variety of federal agencies, but did not talk to insurers or study computer code.

McKinsey — which declined to comment Monday, citing client confidentiality — did not assess whether the administration should have delayed the Oct. 1 launch.

Its presentation noted that federal officials were trying to fix the problems stemming from the botched design process. “CMS has been working to mitigate challenges resulting from program characteristics,” it says in bold.

Advertisement

The consulting firm suggested that some of the project’s troubles occurred because there was “no single empowered decision-making authority,” or person in charge, who could make changes or define what constituted success.

One industry source close to the project, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly, said this lack of an overarching project leader complicated the system’s development because contractors received “absolutely conflicting direction between the various entities within CMS.”

McKinsey suggested some ways to mitigate the risk, including creating a “version 1.0” that was fully tested before the project was finished and assigning a single leader to oversee its implementation. It urged federal officials to set “shared metrics for success” on April 12, more than five months before the rollout.

The administration did not develop metrics to evaluate the site's performance until late October, The Post reported Sunday.

The Web site has been performing better over the past 11 / 2 weeks, but significant glitches remain."

In a closed-door meeting at the Capitol, House Democrats blasted administration officials over their handling of the Obamacare rollout, and the White House’s failure to address Mr. Obama’s broken promise to Americans that they could keep their health insurance plans.

Top Senate Democrats, meanwhile, were giving more support to a legislative proposal that would allow people to keep their insurance plans. The White House said the proposal from Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, Louisiana Democrat, has more merit than a House Republican plan scheduled for a vote Friday.

Presidential aides wouldn’t commit to a specific fix.

White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president is trying to reassure congressional Democrats that he will decide on a solution “sooner rather than later.”

“The frustration that Democrats who strongly support the Affordable Care Act and who strongly believe that it is the right thing to do … [feel] is similar to the frustration the president feels,” Mr. Carney said. “Nobody is satisfied.”

SEE ALSO: Obama concedes, announces changes to health care law

The reasons for the Democrats’ rising anger are clear. With website glitches and millions of constituents receiving insurance cancellation notices, lawmakers who supported the president’s health care reform plan are feeling more vulnerable about their re-election prospects next year, and many who fought for Obamacare are worried that its promise is being threatened by incompetence.

A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday showed that congressional Republicans have erased a 9-point deficit in six weeks in a generic congressional ballot question, and are running even with Democrats. One of the main developments in the past six weeks was the rollout of Obamacare on Oct. 1.

Some Democrats say they were emboldened by former President Bill Clinton’s call Tuesday for Mr. Obama to make good on his “you can keep-your plan” promise even if it required legislative changes to the health care law.

Among the lawmakers who challenged administration officials in the private meeting, Democrats said, were Rep. Michael F. Doyle, Pennsylvania Democrat, and Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, a close ally of Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat. Administration officials taking the brunt of criticism were David Simas, deputy senior adviser to the president, and Mike Hash, director of the Health and Human Services Department’s office of health care reform.

The most urgent political challenge for House Democrats is scheduled for Friday, when they will have to vote on a plan by Rep. Fred Upton, Michigan Republican, that allows people to keep health care policies they like. Several lawmakers warned the administration officials that the White House must offer them a way out of the predicament before that vote.

Mr. Carney said the Upton bill isn’t acceptable because it would “allow insurers to sell new plans that were substandard, that did not meet the minimum benefit standard of the Affordable Care Act, and thereby potentially undermine … the central promise of the Affordable Care Act.”

SEE ALSO: Only 106,000: Obamacare enrollment falls far short of goal

Senate Democrats are scheduled to meet Thursday at the White House to urge the administration to come up with a solution.

Asked about the Quinnipiac poll’s findings that a majority of Americans for the first time find Mr. Obama untrustworthy, Mr. Carney said Washington as a whole is suffering from the fallout of the government shutdown and other failures.

“There is no question that the dysfunction in Washington that the American people have seen is taking its toll on everyone,” Mr. Carney said. “And while the president’s ratings are low for him, they’re sky high in comparison with Congress, and in particular Republicans in Congress. That’s not satisfactory to us, only because it reflects a feeling among the American people that this place is not working for them.”

Rating: About this rating False

Voting in the 2020 U.S. Election may be over, but the misinformation keeps on ticking. Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage Never stop fact-checking. Follow our post-election coverage here

In October 2020, readers asked Snopes to examine widely shared claims that a big book of ""healthcare accomplishments"" given to ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl at the White House had, in fact, been blank.

Stahl was at the White House to conduct a high-profile interview with U.S. President Donald Trump on Oct. 20, 2020. The interview became controversial in its own right when Trump, accusing Stahl of ""bias, hatred and rudeness,"" took the highly unusual step of releasing the White House's own footage of the interview — three days in advance of its scheduled airing on Sunday, Oct. 25. The president bristled at Stahl's questions throughout, and terminated the interview five minutes early.

On Oct. 20, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted out a photograph that showed her in the White House, along with Stahl, who appeared to struggle with the weight of a heavy book of what McEnany described as ""just a small part of what President Trump has done for healthcare in the United States"":

The following day, Trump himself posted four additional photographs of Stahl with the book, along with the following caption: ""Kayleigh McEnany presenting Lesley Stahl... with some of the many things we’ve done for Healthcare. Lesley had no idea!""

In one of the photographs, Stahl has opened the book and is examining what appears to be a blank page:

On this basis, social media users published multiple memes and posts claiming that the entire book was blank, which many observers claimed was ironic or symbolic of what they presented as Trump's lack of accomplishments:

Those claims were false. On Oct. 21, 2020, the right-leaning Washington Examiner reported that:

The Washington Examiner has obtained a PDF of the contents, which shows its 512 pages contain 13 executive orders and 11 other pieces of healthcare legislation enacted under Trump. Further investigation confirmed that it matched the physical book's contents. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: “This book contains all of the executive orders and legislation President Trump has signed..."" Far from being blank, its pages include passages from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 setting out the repeal of the individual mandate, last month's executive order detailing Trump's vision for healthcare, and a slew of other documents. On top were pages of another document, entitled “America First Healthcare Plan.” McEnany said: “The America First Healthcare Plan lays out President Trump’s second term vision...""

Snopes asked the White House and the Trump campaign for a digital copy of the book, or some other evidence demonstrating its contents. We did not receive a response before publication. We will update this fact check if we obtain a copy of the book ourselves.

A spokesperson for CBS News confirmed for Snopes that the book was not blank, though the page Stahl was looking at in the widely-shared photograph did happen to be blank. The CBS spokesperson confirmed that the Washington Examiner's description of the contents of the book was accurate."

The Washington Post reports that the U.S. Postal Service Inspector General's Office recommended this past June that the agency consider terminating more than $200 million in contracts with Accenture. The recommendation cited an ""absence of business ethics"" by the firm, including a 2011 settlement with the Justice Department to resolve allegations of ""kickbacks"" and ""bid-rigging"" in federal contracts. Accenture, which paid $63 million to resolve the claims, denied the allegations.

The Obama administration announced last month that it had tapped Accenture to become the lead contractor for Healthcare.gov after cutting ties with CGI Federal, which handled the site's troubled launch this past Oct. 1. Technical glitches blocked many prospective customers from initially using the site, and while enrollment has picked up, the numbers have struggled to recover from the early setback and reach the administration's benchmarks.

Accenture's contract to oversee Healthcare.gov is believed to be for one year and worth an estimated $91 million. Experts interviewed by the Post were divided over whether Accenture was the right choice to tackle the ongoing problems of the site, with one IT consulting firm executive saying Accenture was ""at the top of the stack"" in the industry. However, the same executive also questioned whether Accenture's relative lack of experience in health care would be an issue. Citing the government spending tracker website USASpending.gov, the Post reported that less than $50 million of Accenture's $10 billion in federal contracts has involved the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The Post reports that nearly 30 projects undertaken by Accenture over the past 10 years have encountered problems like technical malfunctions and cost overruns. Among the troublesome federal projects spotlighted by the Post include a computer system for the Department of the Interior's Mineral Management Service, which regulates the oil industry. A 2007 report quoted an accounted as telling auditors that the system took longer to use than the one it replaced.

More On This...

Between 2004 and 2007, the Post reports that the Pentagon and four states canceled Accenture contracts to develop online voting for voter registration systems. And in 2006, a report by the IT firm The Wendell Group blasted a tax office computer system for the District of Columbia developed by Accenture. The report found that the system incorrectly calculated penalties and interest on tax bills and called it ""poorly designed"" and ""mismanaged.""

""There is a real concern,"" Daniel I Gordon, the former head of government procurement policy for the Obama administration, told the Post. ""This company has problems in their past performance that are relevant and recent ... The real question is whether the government did its due diligence.""

Sep 24 2020,President Trump Finally Laid Out His Healthcare Plan. It Doesn’t Do Anything.,BuzzFeed News,left,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/trump-preexisting-conditions-health-care-surprise-billing,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump will declare Thursday that it is “the policy of the United States” to protect people with preexisting conditions, while also suing to toss out current preexisting condition protections.

Trump plans to sign an executive order in North Carolina laying out the policy, according to White House officials. But even they concede it will have no legal effect.

At the same time, the White House has joined a lawsuit brought by 20 Republican-led states attempting to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act, which bans insurers from denying coverage or jacking up prices on people with preexisting health conditions. That case goes before the Supreme Court for oral arguments Nov. 10.

Thursday’s announcement was billed as “President Trump’s Healthcare Vision for America” but contained no tangible action. Trump has long promised a “beautiful” and “phenomenal” healthcare plan that provides everyone with better coverage for a lower cost, but his administration never unveiled any comprehensive reform plan, even as it was trying to overturn the Affordable Care Act.

Both key planks of Trump’s healthcare vision Thursday essentially boil down to directing Congress — which has repeatedly failed to repeal Obamacare or offer a consensus replacement plan — to figure it out.

Asked how people with preexisting conditions will be protected if the ACA is overturned, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, “we will work with Congress or otherwise to ensure that they’re protected.”

The plan also promises to ban surprise medical billing, but only after the election. The executive order directs Congress to pass legislation to end the practice of surprise billing — when a person goes to a hospital inside their insurance network but is nonetheless hit with medical bills because workers in the hospital are out of network — by Jan. 1.

While widely derided as unethical exploitation of vulnerable patients, surprise billing is nonetheless lucrative business for those doing the billing. Doctors and insurance companies have been in a lobbying war over how to fix the problem, and Congress has done nothing to stop it.

Given Congress’s past failures to act on surprise medical billing, the proximity of the election, the need to keep the government from shutting down at the end of September, and the coming fight over a Supreme Court nominee in the Senate, a Jan. 1 deadline is, at best, optimistic.

If Congress fails to meet the deadline, Azar will be tasked with exploring other options. Azar did not say what those might be. When asked why they are not taking action now, Azar said the plan ""is what it is."""

Sep 21 2017,"Voters hate Republican healthcare bills, but the donors who matter demand repeal",Daily Kos,left,https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/9/21/1700305/-Voters-hate-Republican-healthcare-bills-but-the-donors-who-matter-demand-repeal,"Republican healthcare repeal bills have been massively unpopular. Many of the members of Congress who’ve supported them have hidden out and refused to face constituents, while those who dared hold town halls were angrily confronted. Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was hailed as a hero back home for her vote against repeal. But the Washington Post lets us know what really mattered to the Republican senators who are now, yet again, getting ready to vote for a massively unpopular bill. After they failed at their longtime campaign promise of Obamacare repeal:

... according to GOP senators and aides, Republicans faced an unrelenting barrage of confrontations with some of their closest supporters, donors and friends. The moments occurred in small gatherings that proved even more meaningful than a caustic town hall — at meetings with local business executives, at church, at parks.

They didn’t dare hold town halls open to all their constituents, but boy, they heard it from their donors. The GOP’s repeal bills might have had support under 15 percent in some polls, might have had less than half the support of Obamacare … but the hardcore base, the Republican donors and local bigwigs who your senator actually listens to and cares about? They were all worked up by Donald Trump’s tweets and angry that congressional Republicans had failed. And that’s why Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying, again, to ram through a vote on a bill that few people understand but that has an awful lot in common with those earlier bills that voters loathed.

Thought Obamacare was safe? Think again. Republicans have revived their repeal effort and we must stop them. Keep calling your senators at (202) 224-3121 and tell them DON’T REPEAL OBAMACARE! (After you call, please tell us how it went.)"

Avik Roy, a conservative healthcare policy expert whose work we have cited on many occasions is a big fan of the new proposal, taking to Twitter to declare it a legislative triumph. Agree or disagree -- and I'll do a bit of both below -- the profane, unhinged, substanceless replies from leftists accusing Roy of supporting murder, with more than a dash or two of overt racism, are appalling. Many liberals appear incapable of good-faith debate over good-faith policy differences. More on that in a moment, too. But first, Roy's take:

Finished reading the Senate HC bill. Put simply: If it passes, it’ll be the greatest policy achievement by a GOP Congress in my lifetime. — Avik Roy (@Avik) June 22, 2017



A few highlights from his Forbes analysis, published this morning:

In March, when House Republicans published their bill to replace Obamacare—the American Health Care Act—I described it in Forbes this way: “GOP’s Obamacare Replacement Will Make Coverage Unaffordable For Millions—Otherwise, It’s Great.” I meant it. There were great things about the House bill, in particular its far-reaching reforms of the Medicaid program. But Paul Ryan’s bill contained a fatal flaw. Its flat tax credits, which provided identical assistance to the poor and the wealthy, would price millions of near-elderly low-income workers out of the insurance market and trap millions more in poverty. Fortunately, buried in the House bill was a way out of the morass. Section 202 of the bill contains a transitional schedule of tax credits that was meant to serve as a bridge between the old Obamacare system, ending in 2017, and the new Paul Ryan system, beginning in 2020.



It turns out that if you simply kept that bridge in force, and tossed overboard the Paul Ryan flat tax credit, you’d solve all of these problems with the House bill. By making that change, the near-elderly working poor would be able to afford coverage, and the poverty trap would be eliminated. And that’s precisely what the Senate bill did! Section 102 of the Senate bill—the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017—closely mirrors Section 202 of the House bill, with age- and means-tested tax credits up to 350 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. Making this change not only solves the problems I described above. It also makes it easier to reform the Medicaid program.

I should note at this point that one of my policy concerns about the House-passed bill is that it would hang lower-income near-seniors out to dry with skimpy tax credits, pricing many of them out of affordable coverage. This change, and it's a significant one, addresses that problem. There's an argument to be made that the Senate bill overcompensates, applying a tax credit framework that closely resembles Obamacare to the entire replacement law, rather than more narrowly targeting assistance to populations who would be disproportionately impacted under the House's age-based system. There are good reasons why many conservatives are objecting that ""repeal"" utilizes a whole lot of Obamacare's plumbing. Roy goes to cheer the proposal's Medicaid reforms, talking up vastly increased flexibility for states, and explaining why the system is failing so many people as it's currently constituted. He also briefly touches on my number one problem with the Senate bill:

There’s one key flaw in the Senate bill. It had been originally reported that the bill would contain a six-month waiting period for those who did not sign up during open enrollment each winter. Such a waiting period is important to ensure that people don’t jump in and out of the insurance pool when their sick or healthy, respectively. But no such waiting period was included in the bill, reportedly because the Senate is still trying to work out how such a waiting period would work within Senate parliamentary rules.

This version of the Senate plan has no meaningful and lasting mechanism (front-end ""stabilization"" via bailout-style payments to insurers don't count) to prevent an individual market death spiral. You can't keep Obamacare's dual mandates requiring all insurers to sell plans to people with pre-existing conditions at approximately the same price points as healthy consumers without some form of strong incentive to bring healthy people into the market before getting sick or hurt. Otherwise, people make the eminently rational (and market-destroying) choice to free load, saving hundreds on monthly premiums, secure in the knowledge that if they should need care, they can sign up for price-controlled ""insurance"" as needed. The House bill had a ""continuous coverage"" requirement on this front, as well as allowing carriers to apply a 30 percent surcharge to a non-continuously-insured consumer who suddenly shows up to buy a plan with a pre-existing condition (the House bill also established several layers of protections for people with such conditions). I was never confident that even these elements were adequate to address the challenge. Yet the Senate's version excludes both provisions, even passing over the (arguably less robust) incentive-imposing idea of a half-year waiting period for new customers who failed to sign up during annual open enrollment.

The individual mandate imposed an unconstitutional requirement that every citizen purchase a product; it was only salvaged by a last-minute feat of intellectual gymnastics by Chief Justice Roberts, reimagining it as a tax. Its success in coercing people to enter Obamacare's marketplaces has been wildly exaggerated by the Congressional Budget Office, which continues to ignore actual data while imputing mystical powers to the mandate's effectiveness. Still, it clearly has had some significant impact, but not enough of one to stave off a deteriorating Obamacare spiral. Unless a replacement bill both (a) brings down costs significantly for many Americans in the individual market -- especially younger and healthier ones -- and (b) strongly disincentives free loading as a viable choice, it will fail. In fact, it would likely magnify Obamacare's deepening failures. Perhaps the Senate intends to insert these ideas during the amendment process. Perhaps they've left them out due to concerns over 'Byrd Rule' compliance under reconciliation. Regardless, enacting a law that lacks essential death-spiral-prevention measures would be extremely reckless. It's worse than doing nothing -- which is saying a lot.

While I agree with Roy's support for needed Medicaid reforms, I'm not convinced the Senate's offering is necessarily superior to the House's. The upper chamber punts many of the biggest Medicaid changes to beyond the 2020 and 2024 elections, raising my cynicism about whether those out-year, politically-difficult changes will ever actually occur. And because the Senate bill 'makes up for' this more gradual glide path by instituting a more stringent growth rate for Medicaid's capped spending increases, I worry that political pressures to alter or abandon those changes would become more potent because the ""cliff"" would look steeper as it approaches. I also agree with Philip Klein that one of Roy's comparisons employed to dismiss conservative critics' complaints is unfair -- even as someone who would be willing to support a bill that at least makes relatively modest improvements over the status quo (I'm not sure the Senate proposal does that, yet). All that said, the Left's stupid, self-righteous, nasty demagoguery against this bill is insulting and irresponsible. For a bunch of people who like to claime that the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was caused by heated right-wing rhetoric (this was an entirely scurrilous and baseless charge), they seem awfully eager to smear Republicans as a bunch of greedy, blood-thirsty killers. Disgusting:

I’ve read the Republican “health care” bill. This is blood money. They’re paying for tax cuts with American lives. pic.twitter.com/298DLguNiM — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) June 22, 2017

In this debate, Warren is playing the role of Sarah ""Death Panels"" Palin (though Palin never perpetrated a racial hoax to benefit her career), against whom every fact-checker under the sun sprung into action. Most Democrats have refrained from this degree of wild-eyed, hysterical venom, instead coalescing around the talking point that the Senate bill is ""mean"" -- even more so than the House bill. This is an object lesson in bad-faith argument. The House legislation was excoriated by liberals for failing to guarantee ""community rating"" cost control regulations for people with pre-existing conditions, and for offering insufficiently generous tax credits to older, low income Americans. The Senate iteration substantively addresses both complaints, yet was promptly declared even worse than the House-passed legislation, and not for the substantive reasons I've laid out above. They were always going to dial up the freakout to eleven, regardless of what was in the legislative language. Many on the Left have shifted away from the previous complaints to Medicaid, shouting about how the GOP would ' virtually zero out ' the program, which is flatly untrue. Reversing an unsustainable expansion is wise policy. And decreasing the rate of growth is not a ""deep cut,"" let alone an elimination of the program.

But if Democrats want to talk about what's ""mean,"" Republicans can easily engage them on those terms. It's mean to prop up an objectively failing law that's growing more dysfunctional and harming more people -- and for what? To protect Obama's legacy, dressed up as 'helping people'? It's mean to take a government program that was already badly betraying America's most indigent and vulnerable citizens and expand it to millions of new people, compounding budget and access strains. And it's mean to accuse your opponents of 'killing' people over public policy disagreements, especially when your own policy has not saved American lives, in the aggregate. In fact, as death rates have risen under Obamacare, the stats are worse in Medicaid expansion states than non-expansion states. That's data. Since Democrats seem content to casually throw around slanderous, motive-impugning, sloppy causation arguments, do Medicaid expanders have ""blood on their hands,"" under Sen. Warren's disgraceful standard? I'll leave you with a Politico story about the wiliness of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. I've expressed my deep skepticism about a successful vote occurring next week, but if anyone is capable of delivering a surprise, it's him:

Mar 30 2021,Arkansas just passed the ‘single most extreme anti-trans law’ targeting healthcare for kids,PinkNews,left,https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/03/30/arkansas-trans-transgender-healthcare-bill-ban-asa-hutchinson-dan-levy-laverne-cox-dwyane-wade/,"The Arkansas Senate has passed a bill that would prevent medical practitioners from providing healthcare to trans minors in a shocking blow to the LGBT+ community.

The senate passed HB 1570 on Monday (29 March), making Arkansas the first state to ban puberty blockers and hormone treatment for trans youth.

The bill will now go to governor Asa Hutchinson to be signed into law. LGBT+ rights activists are calling on the governor to veto the dehumanising law.

Chase Strangio, deputy director for transgender justice at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), said HB 1570 is “the single most extreme anti-trans law to ever pass through a state legislature”.

Celebrities, human rights organisations and LGBT+ communities across the United States reacted with fury to the news, with many criticising legislators for attacking and targeting children.

Laverne Cox slammed Arkansas legislators for ‘targeting trans children’

In a video recorded for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Laverne Cox hit out at Arkansas politicians for “targeting children”.

“It’s exhausting,” Cox said in the emotional video. “I encourage us to look at this in the context of years-long attempts to stigmatise and further marginalise trans people and have that stigma codified into law.

“This is not new. We’ve seen bathroom bills, we’ve seen other bills in previous years, and now we see bills like HB 1570, which would criminalise doctors providing healthcare – medically necessary health care – to children.”

“It’s exhausting.” Laverne Cox joined us to speak on HB 1570, Arkansas’ proposed bill that would ban trans people from receiving gender affirming care that they deserve. pic.twitter.com/7IGY4XIOB5



— ACLU (@ACLU) March 29, 2021

Schitt’s Creek star Dan Levy reacted to the horrific bill on Twitter, writing: “This is f**king abhorrent,” while Jameela Jamil branded it “horrific” and said it will not stop trans youth from transitioning.

“Just like banning abortion won’t stop abortions. It will just stop SAFE transitioning. It will also cost more lives than we can fathom.”

She added: “This is so disgusting and inhumane. Trans lives matter. Trans health matters. Trans kids matter.”

Writer Raquel Willis said the law is part of a larger effort to strip trans people of their humanity.

“Transphobes don’t just strip trans women of being women and trans men of being men… as you can see in Arkansas and states across the country, they strip trans children of being children, and essentially, they strip all trans people of simply being people.”

Willis continued: “As hard as it is and as many stumbles will come, we have to continue to be a threat to that power, to the binary. I truly find my reserve of energy in knowing that we’re not the first generations of folk to dream of something better and we won’t be the last one as long as we fight.”

trans + gender nonconforming youth have always been under attack, but this era is different because we literally have lawmakers targetting children because they don't want the general public to know that we are natural, human, and a version of freedom too alluring not to cherish— Raquel Willis (@RaquelWillis_) March 30, 2021

Drag Race star Symone branded the law “disgusting and beyond damaging”, while actress Meghan Rienks said transphobia is “deadly”.

“Why do these people care about unborn children more than the ones who are alive???” she tweeted. “F**k all of y’all. This is inhumane.”

Dwyane Wade, who has been vocal in his support for his trans daughter Zaya, tweeted: “Your hate will not be final. Love will always win in the end!” Arrested Development star David Cross branded the law “disgusting and immoral”.

The bill has been condemned by LGBT+ rights organisations, including the Trevor Project and the Human Rights Campaign.

The evidence is clear: gender-affirming care produces positive mental health outcomes and reduces suicide risk.

“Denying trans people healthcare is denying trans people the right to be themselves,” the Human Rights Campaign wrote on Twitter. “That is not and will never be OK.” The organisation urged the governor to veto the bill.

Sam Brinton of the Trevor Project urged governor Hutchinson to “listen to the experts” on affirming healthcare for trans youth.

“The evidence is clear: gender-affirming care produces positive mental health outcomes and reduces suicide risk. That’s why it’s considered best-practice, embraced by doctors across the country, and endorsed by every major medical association. Governor Hutchinson should listen to the experts – and transgender young people in Arkansas – and veto this cruel bill. It’s a matter of life and dead,” they said.

The latest attack on trans youth in Arkansas comes just days after Hutchinson signed into law a ban on transgender women and girls competing in school sports, while Mississippi governor Tate Reeves signed a similar bill just weeks before.

The bills are part of a “legislative boom” that has taken place in the first three months of 2021, which has seen more than 60 bills introduced in 25 state legislatures targeting transgender children.

Another bill, the Medical Ethics and Diversity Act, is currently making its way to the governor’s desk after it was passed by the Arkansas legislature. If signed, the bill would give medical and healthcare professionals the right to refuse treatment to a patient because of their “religious, moral or ethical beliefs”.

Human rights activists have warned that the bill would allow medical practitioners to refuse treatment to LGBT+ people."

Nov 15 2013,"No, Obama didn't lie to you about your healthcare plan",Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2013/11/15/no_obama_didnt_lie_to_you_about_your_health_care_plan_partner/,"President Obama has been getting a lot of grief in the last few weeks over his pledge that with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in place, people would be able to keep their insurance if they like it. The media have been filled with stories about people across the country who are having their insurance policies terminated, ostensibly because they did not meet the requirements of the ACA. While this has led many to say that Obama was lying, there is much less here than meets the eye.

First, it is important to note that the ACA grand-fathered all the individual policies that were in place at the time the law was enacted. This means that the plans in effect at the time that President Obama was pushing the bill could still be offered even if they did not meet all the standards laid out in the ACA.

The plans being terminated because they don't meet the minimal standards were all plans that insurers introduced after the passage of the ACA. Insurers introduced these plans knowing that they would not meet the standards that would come into effect in 2014. Insurers may not have informed their clients at the time they sold these plans that they would not be available after 2014 because they had designed a plan that did not comply with the ACA.

However if the insurers didn't tell their clients that the new plans would only be available for a short period of time, the blame would seem to rest with the insurance companies, not the ACA. After all, President Obama did not promise people that he would keep insurers from developing new plans that will not comply with the provisions of the ACA.

In addition to the new plans that were created that did not comply with the terms of the ACA, there have been complaints that the grandfathering was too strict. For example, insurers can only raise their premiums or deductibles by a small amount above the rate of medical inflation. As a result, many of the plans in existence at the time of the ACA are losing their grandfathered status.

In this case also it is wrong to view the insurers as passive actors who are being forced to stop offering plans because of the ACA. The price increases charged by insurers are not events outside of the control of insurers. If an insurer offers a plan which has many committed buyers, then presumably it would be able to structure its changes in ways that are consistent with the ACA. If it decides not to do so, this is presumably because the insurer has decided that it is not interested in continuing to offer the plan.

As a practical matter, there are many plans that insurers will opt to drop for market reasons that may or may not have anything to do with the ACA. It's hard to see how this could be viewed as a violation of President Obama's pledge. After all, insurers change and drop plans all the time. Did people who heard Obama's pledge understand it to mean that insurers would no longer have this option once the ACA passed?

If Obama's pledge was understood as ensuring that every plan that was in existence in 2010 would remain in existence, then it would imply a complete federal takeover of the insurance industry. This would require the government to tell insurers that they must continue to offer plans even if they are losing money on them and even if the plans had lost most of their customers. This would at the least be a strange policy. It would be surprising if many people thought this was the meaning of President Obama's pledge.

Finally, there will be many plans that insurers will stop offering in large part because of the changed market conditions created by the ACA. For example, last week the Washington Post highlighted a plan for the ""hardest to insure"" that was being cancelled by Pathmark Blue Cross of Pennsylvania.

This plan is likely being cancelled because it is unable to compete with the insurance being offered through the exchanges. The exchanges charge everyone the same rate regardless of their pre-existing health conditions. A plan that is especially designed for people who have serious health conditions would almost certainly charge a far higher rate. If these high-priced plans no longer exist because they cannot compete with the exchanges would this mean that President Obama had broken his pledge?

On closer inspection, the claim that President Obama lied in saying that people could keep their insurance looks like another Fox News special. In the only way that the pledge could be interpreted as being meaningful, the pledge is true. The ACA does not eliminate plans that were in existence at the time the bill was approved.

If we want to play Fox News, President Obama also promised people they could keep their doctor. Since 2010 tens of thousands of doctors have retired or even died. Guess the pledge that people could keep their doctor was yet another lie from the Obama administration."

HealthCare.gov and similar state Web sites are meant to be one-stop shopping sites for health insurance for Americans who cannot get or afford coverage through a job. People who log on are supposed to be able to see an array of plans available to them at different price points and to apply for government assistance that will help most of them buy insurance.

But many who have tried to use the site have been locked out, and reports continue to emerge about errors discovered deeper in the system. Administration officials said this week they have enlisted leading experts as part of a “tech surge” to address the problems, but have declined to say when the site will be fixed.

A smoothly running site is critical, in part because most uninsured people will be required next year to carry health insurance or pay a fine.

The Department of Health and Human Services declined to send a representative to the hearing. However, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is scheduled to testify before the panel on Wednesday. Talking with reporters Thursday, Bataille ducked questions about whether Sebelius had been aware that tests in the two weeks before the online marketplace opened showed that the Web site wasn’t entirely working.

The Washington Post reported this week that as late as Sept. 26, there had been no ""end-to-end"" testing of the site mimicking the real-life experience of thousands of users simultaneously trying to get online and buy coverage. During the first such test, the system crashed at a few hundred users, according to people familiar with the project.

It is unclear why there is a discrepancy between that timing and the testimony Thursday from the contractors that complete tests began in the middle of September.

Committee members asked how early that sort of testing would be done in an ideal situation.

“Months would be nice,” said Andy Slavitt, executive vice president of Optum. The company owns Columbia, Md.-based Quality Software Services Inc. (QSSI), which built part of the Web site. It also built the “data hub,” a network connecting HealthCare.gov with many other state, federal and insurer databases.

Also present at the hearing were executives from Serco, the company processing paper applications, and Equifax Workforce Solutions, a subsidiary of the credit-reporting company that is providing income and employment information to help determine a person’s eligibility for Medicaid or subsidies.

But most of the attention fell on CGI and Optum, whose representatives admitted no culpability during the hearing despite grilling by committee members upset that some of the same executives testified at a Sept. 10 hearing that their parts of the project were going well.

“Either you didn’t know about these problems or you knew about them and chose not to disclose them. Which one is it?” Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.) asked CGI’s Campbell.

Campbell said the parts of the project under CGI’s purview were tested properly and working well, but faulted CMS for failing to complete overall testing sooner. The agency served as the systems integrator, or coordinator, of the project.

“End-to-end testing was the responsibility of CMS,” she said.

Slavitt said QSSI sent warnings. “All of the concerns that we had, which were mostly related to testing and the inability to get as much testing as we would’ve liked, we expressed all of those concerns and risks to CMS throughout the project,” he said.

For their part, Democrats raised pointed questions about the Web site’s flaws while defending the law as a whole.

“For the Affordable Care Act to work, these problems need to be fixed and these problems need to be fixed fast,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) said in her opening statement.

She also took a dig at her Republican counterparts for their somewhat awkward stance at the hearing — furious about problems in the implementation of a law they oppose and argue will fail.

“I’m so happy, and touched, really, today to hear the majority express these concerns about making the ACA work better,” she said. “And I really hope that they’re legitimate in it.”"

Oct 21 2013,HealthCare.gov's glitches prompt Obama to call in more computer experts,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/experts-working-to-fix-healthcaregov-insurance-marketplace-officials-say/2013/10/20/1e1a35ce-39b4-11e3-a94f-b58017bfee6c_story.html?hpid=z1,"The Obama administration said Sunday that it has enlisted additional computer experts from across the government and from private companies to help rewrite computer code and make other improvements to the online health insurance marketplace, which has been plagued by technical defects that have stymied many consumers since it opened nearly three weeks ago.

This expanded team has come up with new ways of monitoring which parts of the federal Web site, HealthCare.gov, are having problems and has been taking the site offline for rigorous overnight tests, according to a Department of Health and Human Services spokesman.

""Unfortunately, the experience on HealthCare.gov has been frustrating for many Americans,"" HHS officials said in a blog post Sunday afternoon, acknowledging what has been obvious to millions of insurance seekers who live in the three dozen states relying on the federal exchange. For the first time, the administration appealed to people to report their interactions, good or bad, with the exchange, a core element of the 2010 health-care law.

President Obama is expected to address the site's technical problems — ""troubles that he and his team find unacceptable"" — at a White House event Monday to highlight the law, according to an administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event has not yet taken place.

View Graphic Calculator: How much will you pay for insurance?

""I think that there's no one more frustrated than the president at the difficulty in the Web site,"" Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

The remarks Sunday, and Obama’s expected comments Monday, represent a slight strategic shift for an administration that has repeatedly refused to say publicly exactly what is wrong with the site or what is being done to fix it. The new tack offers a bit more information while allowing officials to strike a sympathetic tone toward consumers exasperated by their experiences.

Even now, administration officials are declining to disclose many details about the debugging effort. They will not say how many experts — whom they describe as “the best and the brightest” — are on the team, when the team began its work or how soon the site’s flaws might be corrected. Still, in talking about the repairs, administration officials for the first time conceded that the site’s problems extend beyond well-publicized front-end obstacles, such as with setting up a personal account.

Since the exchange opened, officials at the White House and HHS had until now insisted that the site’s problems were caused primarily by its popularity — that more people were trying to get on than could be accommodated at once. Even Sunday, the HHS spokesman said the “main driver of the problems is volume.”

Yet insurance companies, consumers and health policy experts have noticed problems that occur further along in the process of using the exchange. The Web site sometimes gives inaccurate information about the federal tax credits that will help most people pay for a health plan, they say. And it sometimes erroneously tells low-income people that they are not eligible for Medicaid.

The exchange also is having trouble handling applications from people who are offered coverage through their jobs but could find better or less-expensive health plans through the new marketplace. Although the exchange is designed primarily for Americans who lack access to coverage through their jobs, it also may be used by workers whose employer-sponsored insurance would be too skimpy or expensive for them. Reports have surfaced that the exchange is not able to process applications from such employees.

Separately, insurers have complained that they are getting confusing information about who has signed up, with the exchange generating data that suggest multiple enrollments and cancellations for the same person on the same day.

With such issues arising, the administration is facing intensifying pressure to be more forthcoming. Some of the pressure is practical. With HealthCare.gov’s problems lingering beyond the initial days, no one knows whether the Web site’s troubles might be deterring Americans who need insurance. That raises concerns that the frustrations may discourage healthy people, who may be less motivated to sign up in the first place. Because they need relatively little medical treatment, these healthy enrollees are crucial to ensuring the financial stability of the insurance marketplace.

There is political pressure as well. The administration is eager to rebuff fresh assaults by congressional Republicans, who have been trying to undermine Obama's signature health-care law since its enactment 31 / 2 years ago. The GOP's last major strategy — forcing the recent government shutdown in an effort to unravel the law — failed. With the government back open, Republicans are trying to make the case that the exchange's technical defects are evidence that the law is misguided.

On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to conduct a hearing on the exchange's rocky debut. Republicans are calling for the ouster of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who has indicated that she has a schedule conflict that prevents her from appearing at the hearing. HHS officials say they are trying to cooperate with the committee in other, unspecified ways.

The Republican naysaying has taken on new significance now that the exchange has been launched. The Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to carry health insurance, starting in January. And the new insurance marketplaces — the one run by the federal government and the 14 others operated by states — are intended as the primary way to make coverage more available and affordable for many of the nation’s uninsured. Federal estimates have suggested that 7 million Americans may sign up in the first period of open enrollment, which extends until March 31.

The administration has not released data on how many people have enrolled through the federal exchange; officials say they will disclose initial figures in November. The administration has said that nearly a half-million Americans have filed applications for insurance through the federal and state exchanges. Applying is an early step in the process, in which people submit, for instance, information needed to determine whether they qualify for federal subsidies. Only after their applications are accepted can they shop for health plans in their areas and go on to enroll in them."
Jun 28 2017,Senate Healthcare Debacle,Salon,left,,Text not found
Aug 08 2021,Progressives demand more for climate action and healthcare as infrastructure bill clears key Senate hurdle,AlterNet,left,https://alternet.org/2021/08/infrastructure-bill/,"As the United States Senate on Saturday voted to advance a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, progressive lawmakers warned that they will not vote for the proposed legislation if it does not adequately fund human needs such as healthcare, housing, and climate action.

Saturday's 67-27 Senate cloture vote on the 2,700-page Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (pdf) overcame a major barrier to the measure's passage, although it was unclear when the Senate would hold a final vote on the bill.

""We can get this done the easy way or the hard way,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor before the vote. ""In either case, the Senate will stay in session until we finish our work. It's up to my Republican colleagues how long it takes.""

The deal—which falls short of the $2.25 trillion originally proposed in President Joe Biden's American Jobs Plan, and is far less than the $10 trillion that progressives say should be spent—includes $550 billion in new infrastructure funding, including for roads and bridges, public transport, railways, broadband internet, port and airport upgrades, power and water system improvements, and environmental remediation.

Notably absent from the deal are progressive agenda items including a 7% corporate tax hike, Medicaid expansion, workforce development, and, critically, measures to address the climate crisis.

Biden took to Twitter Saturday to tout the deal:









Addressing the bill's climate shortcomings, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse tweeted Saturday that ""the plan is to get this bill passed and focus on the reconciliation package next. That's where the big climate provisions will be.""

Democrats plan to use the reconciliation process to thwart a Republican filibuster of $3.5 trillion in additional spending on progressive priorities including climate action, Medicare expansion, free community college, universal pre-K, and paid family leave, to be funded by tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy.

Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) last month called the more ambitious progressive proposal ""the most significant piece of legislation... since the Great Depression.""

Progressive lawmakers and advocates have lamented what they say are the bipartisan deal's many inadequacies, with the Congressional Progressive Caucus vowing Saturday to oppose any bill that does not include funding for climate and social agenda items.





As Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said earlier this week, ""If the bipartisan bill isn't passed with a reconciliation package that has our popular priorities, we're not voting for it.""

Appearing on Democracy Now! earlier this week, Jacobin staff writer Branko Marcetic said that ""the bipartisan bill, by virtue of having to negotiate with the Republicans, who, of course, are climate deniers and... are captured by corporate interests, including fossil fuels, of course, they do not want a whole host of climate measures in there that are going to compete with those industries or that will... eventually phase them out.""

""So, a lot of that stuff has been stripped down,"" Marcetic added. ""The clean energy standard, which was meant to be one of the cornerstones of transitioning the United States' electricity grid away from fossil fuels and to renewable energy, that's out of the bill.""

As The Interceptreported earlier this week, the bipartisan deal includes $25 billion in potential new fossil fuel subsidies.

According to the outlet:

The bill includes billions of dollars for carbon capture, utilization, and storage; hydrogen fuel made from natural gas; and ""low emissions buses"" that could run on fuels including hydrogen and natural gas. It also encourages subsidies that go unquantified in the legislation, for example urging states to waive property taxes for pipelines to transport captured carbon.



Progressives are also seething at a Republican amendment that would increase Pentagon funding by $50 billion.





Marcetic warned of the potential consequences facing Democrats ahead of the 2022 midterm elections if they do not fight for the provisions in the more ambitious $3.5 trillion proposal.

""It's going to be very difficult for Democrats to actually hold the House and the Senate,"" he told Democracy Now! ""If this doesn't get passed, it will be looked at as a massive missed opportunity that we will really regret, I think, in years to come."""
Mar 09 2017,Trump's backup plan for a healthcare bill loss: Destroy Obamacare and blame Democrats,Daily Kos,left,http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/3/9/1641776/-Trump-s-backup-plan-for-a-healthcare-bill-loss-Destroy-Obamacare-and-blame-Democrats,"A lot of Republicans hate Donald Trump’s healthcare plan, and he’s sending out mixed messages about how hard he plans to fight for it and how much he’s willing to change it. But it seems he’s prepared to lose—he just plans to turn his loss into a problem for people who need health care and for Democrats.

""This is going to be great. You're going to make it even greater,"" the President told the group, sources at the White House meeting told CNN. ""I'm going to work hard to get it done."" But should the bill eventually fail, Trump outlined a backup plan: Allow Obamcare to fail and let Democrats take the blame, sources said.

There’s a lot a president can do to undermine how well Obamacare works, so letting it fail is a very real threat. And letting it fail would hurt a lot of people. Some of those people just might notice that things started getting worse under Trump, but Democrats would need to be ready to fight to make sure people noticed, and didn’t get fooled by ads backed by an avalanche of Republican money.

But step one in making sure people know what’s going on is this: making sure they know Trump is telling Republicans he’s ready to lose … as long as he has a way to turn someone else into a loser along with him. His focus is on screwing up your health care, by whatever means he has available."

Speaking from Charlotte, North Carolina, President Trump outlined the “three pillars” of his new healthcare plan:

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2020

The president’s order criticizes the ACA, pointing to the law’s failure to expand coverage and reduce the price of premiums, despite promises from the previous administration.

“In an attempt to justify the ACA, the previous Administration claimed that, absent action by the Congress, up to 129 million (later updated to 133 million) non-elderly people with what it described as pre-existing conditions were in danger of being denied health-insurance coverage...The average insurance premium in the individual market more than doubled from 2013 to 2017, and those who have not received generous Federal subsidies have struggled to maintain coverage. For those who have managed to maintain coverage, many have experienced a substantial rise in deductibles, limited choice of insurers, and limited provider networks that exclude their doctors and the facilities best suited to care for them.”

President Trump also revealed that his administration will send pre-loaded cards, valuing $200, to over 33 million Medicare recipients, in order to alleviate the price of prescriptions."

Washington CNN —

Americans frustrated by attempts to purchase health insurance on www.HealthCare.gov will soon be able to determine their eligibility for tax subsidies and purchase insurance directly from insurance companies and private exchanges, a government spokeswoman announced Tuesday.

Julie Bataille of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that oversees the government’s online insurance exchange, told reporters on a conference call that as of Tuesday morning, the process called “direct enrollment” should be functioning.

“With the fixes that we’ve put in place as of this morning, we do believe that the majority of those high-priority fixes for direct enrollment to work have been addressed,” Bataille said. “We continue to work with issuers and work through some additional issues.”

Customers not eligible for tax subsidies have been able to use direct enrollment since October 1, but the fixes put in place Tuesday expand the process to all customers seeking insurance on the individual market.

Battaille added that she expects insurance companies and other issuers will need to test the government’s technical fixes within their own systems and then begin using the direct-enrollment process “in the coming days.”

Bad news for woman cited as Obamacare success story

If it’s functioning properly, customers should be able to go directly to an insurance company’s website to learn about plan offerings. They would then be referred to Healthcare.gov to determine their eligibility for a federal tax credit and then directed back to the company site to purchase a plan.

Direct enrollment can also be used by private insurance exchanges such as eHealth.com and GetInsured.com. A spokeswoman for GetInsured.com confirmed that the government had alerted her company about the new fixes.

“We’ve entered into agreements with more than 30 of those kinds of entities,” Bataille said, adding that CMS has issued guidance over the past several months to these partners regarding how they can interact with the federal marketplace and the fixes put in place Tuesday should address their problems.

“We believe that they are on track to begin their transactions as soon as possible,” she said. “This is something that obviously they will make a determination about individually as they see how their system is interacting with ours.”

Obamacare enrollments pick up steam but don’t include many young people

Earlier on Tuesday, CMS Deputy Chief Information Officer Henry Chao told members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the federal marketplace was just 70% completed, meaning 30% of the marketplace still needed to be developed.

“That 30% represents the payment aspects and the accounting aspects of making payments in the marketplaces, for all marketplaces, not just federally facilitated marketplaces,” Chao said. “And that functionality has to be in place for the January 1 effective date enrollments.”

Bataille confirmed that the unfinished part of the marketplace included the portion responsible for paying out consumers’ tax subsidies directly to insurance companies, but she said that the development of those portions is on track.

“We are on track for this functionality to be available in the time frame that it would be necessary to process those transactions so that people would be able to have their coverage in January,” Bataille said.

Many of the lawmakers who have been railing against the new health plan in their home districts may face questions back home once they sign up for the exchanges they have criticized.

In fact, President Obama got re-elected thanks to the argument, ""Don't let Republicans let the government get between you and your doctor.""

Advertisement

With the Obamacare rollout continuing to fail and as millions of women start to lose their health insurance plans, times have changed and it's now acceptable for Democratic men to lecture women about exactly how they should handle their healthcare needs. Last Friday night on Hannity, 29-year-old Natalie Willis told her personal story about losing a health insurance plan in the individual market place that she loved, despite President Obama promising she could keep it. Thanks to Obamacare, Willis will now pay more money for the same amount of coverage under a different plan.

""This is what I have to say: If I wanted a plan that covered more, I would have gotten a plan that covered more,"" Willis said. ""I love the insurer I had, I would be heart broken to leave them. People don't love their insurers, I love my insurance and I love my doctors.""

The patronizing response to her story from Democratic strategist Rick Ungar is telling. Ungar argues Willis simply didn't know what was in her plan and implied she hadn't done the proper research to realize she had a subpar insurance in the first place. Further, he argued healthcare plans on the Obamacare exchanges would provide better coverage at a better price, which isn't true.

""I would like to sit down with Natalie and get on the exchange,"" Unger said. ""You know what else Natalie didn't mention? You can buy a policy off the exchange, have you checked that out?""

""You don't know,"" Unger continued. ""Let me make the point. If you go to buy a car and you don't pick up the hood, right? You buy the car and then you get in the car and it doesn't start. You know why? There was no engine under the hood and you didn't know it.""

The entire video clip is worth your time. Jedidiah Bila summed it up best, ""It doesn't matter if you like her plan or if I like her plan or if President Obama likes her plan. What matters is that she liked her plan and she was promised she could keep her plan and it was taken away and now her costs are rising and she's facing the consequences for a promise unkept.""

Top White House and health officials were worried that healthcare.gov would not only malfunction, but also that it would set off a whole new wave of bad publicity for the president.

The emails dated September 25th, focused on problems that could come up if there was high traffic to the health care website. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Deputy Chief said, “When Todd Park and Marilyn [Tavenner] was here yesterday one of the things Todd conveyed was this fear the WH was about hc.gov being unavailable.”

According to POLITICO:

Later on in the email chain, which was sent to a few dozen CMS staff and outside contractor personnel, Chao wrote to two colleagues: “… can you think about a better way to convey to the public when the site is not available? I am picturing in my mind all the major print and online publications taking screenshots of what is below and just ramping up the hyperbole about hc.gov not functional.” Attached is picture of an error message which says, “The System is down at the moment.”

With so much warning about the problems with the website, why was it launched? If a company released a product before it was ready, no one would buy it and the company would go out of business. But instead, we have to hear press conference after press conference explaining how this was an unexpected problem and that we need to stick with them while they figure things out. How about they just fix the problem already and apologize for the disaster that is the healthcare.gov rollout."
Dec 02 2013,Ills of HealthCare.gov: Insurers say ObamaCare site producing flawed forms,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/02/insurers-say-healthcaregov-not-fixed-yet/,"So you think you've succeeded in making it through the ObamaCare website maze, and now you have health insurance? You might want to think again.

Despite the Obama administration's claim that HealthCare.gov is ""vastly improved,"" insurance companies are still grappling with error-riddled files fed to them from the flawed website. The lingering glitch could cause major problems weeks down the road, resulting in people thinking they've signed up when insurance companies have no record of them doing so.

These so-called ""back-end"" problems were largely glossed over when federal health officials confidently claimed over the weekend they had met their own goals for improving the website by Dec. 1.

Administration officials said early Sunday that they have fixed roughly 400 computer ""bugs"" and increased capacity so the site can now handle more than 800,000 users daily with an error rate of less than 1 percent. Jeff Zients, the official appointed to fix the ObamaCare site since its disastrous Oct. 1 rollout, said it is ""night and day from what it was.""

But insurers continue to deal with the same set of problems that have shaken their confidence for weeks in the system they have to rely on to enroll new customers.

More On This...

""Until the enrollment process is working from end-to-end, many consumers will not be able to enroll in coverage,"" Karen Ignagni, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, said in a statement.

She said ""significant 'back-end' issues'"" need to be addressed, and particularly the ""ongoing problems"" processing enrollment files known as ""834 files.""

These are forms that give insurance companies basic information about would-be customers.

But they've had problems for weeks. AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach told FoxNews.com that companies are receiving duplicative and inaccurate forms, and ""in some cases, plans are not getting the enrollment files at all.""

Getting that fixed, he said, is ""critical.""

The New York Times reports that companies are getting flooded with phone calls from people who think they've signed up -- though they're not on record as having done so.

The ongoing problems mean that people who believe they have a health plan could be in for a surprise on Jan. 1.

Though the administration has given people until the end of March to sign up for coverage if they want to avoid a fine, coverage for many is supposed to start on Jan. 1. That leaves just 30 days to fix the remaining glitches.

""This is not a functioning website yet,"" James Capretta, senior fellow with the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told Fox News.

Other problems persist:

-- Bloomberg reports that after the troubled Oct. 1 launch, the Obama administration boosted its enrollment numbers for November -- with roughly 100,000 people signing up through HealthCare.gov.

That figure, however, is far short of the original goal of enrolling 800,000 people in the first two months.

-- Fox News' own attempt to log in at HealthCare.gov on Sunday was spotty at best.

After the site allowed the user to fill in personal information like a Social Security number, a notice came up that said: ""Verification system temporarily unavailable.""

In addition, the site asked if a navigator or insurance broker was helping with the application. After ""none of these people"" was selected, a screen came back that said, incorrectly: ""You've told us another person is helping you complete the application."""

Sep 12 2013,AFL-CIO Realizes They Can't Keep Their Union Healthcare Plans Under Obamacare,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/09/12/aflcio-realizes-they-cant-keep-their-union-healthcare-plans-under-obamacare-n1698377,"Advertisement

The AFL-CIO approved a resolution saying that President Obama's health care overhaul will drive up the costs of union-sponsored health plans to the point that workers and employers are forced to abandon them.



In a strongly worded resolution released Wednesday, the federation said that labor unions still support the Affordable Care Act's overall goals of reducing health costs and bringing coverage to all Americans, but added that the law is being implemented in a way that is ""highly disruptive"" to union health care plans.



Some individual unions have complained about the law's impact for months, but the resolution marks the first time the nation's largest labor federation has gone on record embracing that view. Unions were among the most enthusiastic backers of the law when it passed in 2010.



“It still needs to be tweaked,” said Trumka, who pointed to the possibility that union members will lose their health insurance because of the inability of some union plans to qualify for federal tax subsidies.



When you and the President sought our support for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), you pledged that if we liked the health plans we have now, we could keep them. Sadly, that promise is under threat. Right now, unless you and the Obama Administration enact an equitable fix, the ACA will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits, but destroy the foundation of the 40 hour work week that is the backbone of the American middle class.



Like millions of other Americans, our members are front-line workers in the American economy. We have been strong supporters of the notion that all Americans should have access to quality, affordable health care. We have also been strong supporters of you. In campaign after campaign we have put boots on the ground, gone door-to-door to get out the vote, run phone banks and raised money to secure this vision.



Now this vision has come back to haunt us.



Since the ACA was enacted, we have been bringing our deep concerns to the Administration, seeking reasonable regulatory interpretations to the statute that would help prevent the destruction of non-profit health plans. As you both know first-hand, our persuasive arguments have been disregarded and met with a stone wall by the White House and the pertinent agencies. This is especially stinging because other stakeholders have repeatedly received successful interpretations for their respective grievances. Most disconcerting of course is last week’s huge accommodation for the employer community—extending the statutorily mandated “December 31, 2013” deadline for the employer mandate and penalties.



Time is running out: Congress wrote this law; we voted for you. We have a problem; you need to fix it. The unintended consequences of the ACA are severe. Perverse incentives are already creating nightmare scenarios.

The AFL-CIO is finally realizing one thing: When President Obama said ""if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it,"" he wasn't telling the truth. In the case of union worker healthcare plans, without a fix, Obamacare will make current coverage unaffordable and therefore unavailable. Late Wednesday, the AFL-CIO passed another scathing resolution criticizing President Obama's signature legislation.Back in August, AFL-CIO Nevada passed a resolution to openly criticize Obamacare. Two weeks ago, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who has been an honored guest of Obama's at many Washington events, openly admitted mistakes were made with Obamacare and that the legislation needs to be "" tweeked. demanding the legislation be fixed before it destroys the 40 hour work week.AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka blindly followed Obama's lead for political reasons and now he's dealing with the consequences of doing so. Instead of being concerned about AFL-CIO workers, Trumka was concerned about getting invited to cocktail parties and fancy events with Obama.As a reminder:

Quite the change in tune."
Dec 11 2018,"Blue on Blue: Democrats Already Fighting Each Other on Healthcare, Court-Packing Scheme",Townhall,right,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2018/12/11/crackup-democratic-fissures-already-start-to-emerge-n2537255,"As Republican Congressional leadership learned the hard way after their party's 2010 electoral romp, keeping a sprawling new majority on track and in check -- especially in an era of divided government -- is a serious political challenge. The hard-charging and newly-empowered Tea Party contingent had its priorities and perceived mandate, but so did more moderate members from swing districts, many of whom were wiped out last month. Then there was the base. Conservative voters were delighted to have relegated Nancy Pelosi to minority status, but they expected big, swift, and sometimes undeliverable results to halt and roll back the Obama agenda. Internal resentments simmered. Occasional legislative embarrassments ensued, with internecine partisan warfare bubbling into the open.

Democrats now find themselves in a similar position. Their newly-elected majority includes genuine radicals, mainline liberals, and self-described moderates. Their voters ranged from committed ideologues, to pragmatists, to people simply alienated from the other tribe. Their core supporters loathe Donald Trump, believe him to be an illegitimate president (conspiracy theories have a way of taking root among the faithful when their party is out of power), and expect full resistance. Reality will be more complicated. Some of the battles will be papered over, like when Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed Nancy Pelosi for Speaker shortly after leading a protest outside of her office. Others will be trickier, like the fight between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House progressives over wall funding and border security concessions. Then there's the question of ""Medicare for All,"" the shockingly unaffordable government healthcare scheme that is fast becoming a Democratic litmus test ahead of 2020. A struggle is brewing:

coalition/governing challenges, part 1 of many... pic.twitter.com/Kwbo7L00Tk — Guy Benson (@guypbenson) December 10, 2018

The united front that helped Democrats save Obamacare just a year ago is falling apart over single-payer health care. Deep-pocketed hospital, insurance and other lobbies are plotting to crush progressives’ hopes of expanding the government's role in health care once they take control of the House. The private-sector interests, backed in some cases by key Obama administration and Hillary Clinton campaign alumni, are now focused on beating back another prospective health care overhaul, including plans that would allow people under 65 to buy into Medicare. This sets up a potentially brutal battle between establishment Democrats who want to preserve Obamacare and a new wave of progressive House Democrats who ran on single-payer health care...The rift could come into full view in the opening weeks of the new Congress, as the party long bound by a need to defend the Affordable Care Act tries to embrace a new health care vision it can carry into the 2020 presidential campaign. House Democratic leaders already are emphasizing the need to align behind a more pragmatic agenda...But House progressives, buoyed by voter enthusiasm and a surge of single-payer support among the party's base, have other ideas.

As we've explored on multiple occasions, there is no way to pay for this single-payer experiment, absent gigantic tax increases. Democrats just won by campaigning on the idea that Republicans would uproot a healthcare status quo in damaging and disruptive ways, and by (inaccurately) claiming that the tax reform law doesn't help the middle class. Will they turn around and push a massively disruptive healthcare overhaul that would rip more than 150 million Americans off of their existing plans, hugely spiking taxes on all families, workers and businesses in the process? Even the DNC Chairman has conceded the point on tax increases. These are highly unpleasant realities that statists must acknowledge and deal with. Speaking of the leader of the Democratic National Committee, he's flirting with the truly radical idea of a court-packing maneuver -- via the Free Beacon:

DNC’s Perez Joins Liberal Activists Hoping to Pack Supreme Court https://t.co/TRtdIASwpZ via @BrentScher — Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) December 9, 2018

Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez delivered remarks during a Demand Justice event where liberal activists pushed radical proposals such as packing the Supreme Court with additional justices if Democrats regain power. Demand Justice, a group run by former Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon that took a leading role in the fight against Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, hosted a Wednesday night discussion on solutions to fix a ""court in crisis"" now that Donald Trump has gotten two justices confirmed in his first two years in office. Fallon introduced Perez with a speech on how proposals to ""meaningfully reform the Supreme Court"" need to be part of the Democratic presidential primary discussion. ""We must look at ideas like expanding the number of justices on the Court, to ensure that a future Democratic president might have the chance to fill two or more seats,"" Fallon said...Perez did not specifically argue for the proposal to pack the court or other recommendations such as impeaching Kavanaugh or installing term limits for justices, but he did characterize the ""reform proposals"" that were being offered during the event as ""practical suggestions.""

Advertisement

That hedging sounds like a party boss not wanting to inflame a motivated constituency by rejecting or even challenging their dangerous ideas. Perez basically dodged the core question, but expanded the Left's 'Overton Window' by winking at a wild-eyed scheme to pack the Court by adding seats as a ""practical suggestion."" It's not. Meanwhile, Senate Democrats are still licking their wounds after their previous (comparatively less extreme) power grabs backfired spectacularly. Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans have forced Democrats to lie in the bed they've made, and it has not been a pleasant experience. Indeed, the current unpleasantness will continue for at least two more years, thanks to the 2018 election results.

Democrats have expressed regret for their prior short-sightedness as they've been stung repeatedly by their own tactics, so I'm not at all confident that there's a critical mass of members who would sign on for such a shocking new escalation. But hardcore elements of the base will demand it, and it could become a lightning rod or threshold question in the already-hopping presidential primary. It's time for reporters to start getting every Democratic Senator on the record: Will they categorically rule out adding more seats to the Supreme Court? Mitch McConnell will be watching closely.

UPDATE - On the subject of judges...

With @VP breaking a 50-50 tie, Jonathan A. Kobes has been confirmed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

Nov 14 2013,"Administration: 106,000 enrolled in health insurance in first month of HealthCare.gov",Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-committee-hears-from-technology-officials-on-health-care-exchanges/2013/11/13/91d0bc5a-4c6e-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html,"Slightly more than 106,000 Americans signed up for health plans in the first month of new state and federal insurance marketplaces, the Obama administration reported Wednesday. The figure, which was far lower than the administration predicted, points to the steep challenge ahead as the White House tries to overcome public and congressional frustration with the program’s problem-plagued rollout.

The tally showed that just a quarter of the enrollments were in the federally run marketplace, while the rest were in the state exchanges.

Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius described the numbers in upbeat terms. “At the end of the day, the promise of quality affordable coverage is increasingly becoming a reality for more and more Americans,” she said.

The enrollment picture emerged as the White House tried to quell growing upset in Congress, including among many Democrats, about a related issue: complaints from people whose individual policies are being canceled because they do not comply with new coverage rules. White House press secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday that “sooner rather than later” President Obama will announce a strategy to deal with such cancellations.

In the meantime, lawmakers from both parties are gathering support for legislation that would make it easier for people to be able to keep their policies if they wish.

The enrollment tally is the first official indication of the desire and ability of uninsured Americans to get coverage under the 2010 law. Slightly fewer than 27,000 enrollments, or one-fourth of the total, occurred in the 36 states that rely on HealthCare.gov, the troubled federal Web site. The rest were in 11 of the 14 states that have created their own marketplaces, which are generally working better than the federal one. A few states are not yet reporting.

The figures, which cover Oct. 1 to Nov. 2, are significantly lower than the administration’s only known forecast, which suggested that nearly half a million people would sign up for private health plans during the first month of the initial six-month enrollment period for the exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office has predicted that 7 million people will buy coverage through the exchanges by spring.

HHS officials took pains to put the low numbers in the context of other recent expansions of government insurance, which also began slowly.

The health plans available through the federal and state marketplaces are a central feature of the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature domestic accomplishment — one that has become a source of embarrassment because of the marred launch of HealthCare.gov. The president’s friends and foes alike had eagerly awaited the first enrollment “snapshot,” as HHS officials termed it.

Republicans used the figures as fresh ammunition to disparage the law. Calling the numbers ""abysmal,"" Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) said they are ""another early warning sign that this legislation . . . ultimately cannot be fixed.""

Democrats lavished praise. “Even with the difficulties of the Web site, we have seen tremendous demand for what the Affordable Care Act has to offer,” said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.).

The administration report counted people as having enrolled in a plan if they selected one, even if they have not begun to pay for it. The marketplaces are intended mainly for those who cannot get insurance through a job.

In Virginia, a state that relies on the federal marketplace, the figures show, 1,023 people — out of about 32,000 who are eligible — chose a health plan last month. In Maryland, which is running its own exchange, 1,284 out of about 3,500 have signed up. The report did not include enrollment figures for the District, which also is operating a separate exchange.

Richard Sorian, a spokesman for DC Health Link, said that, unlike the federal figures, the District’s exchange does not track individuals but that people in 1,115 households had signed up for coverage.

Nationwide, in addition to the people who have signed up for a private health plan, about 396,000 lower-income people have been told they are eligible for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program.

The figures show that many more people began to shop for a health plan than have signed up so far — especially in the states using the federal marketplace. Federal health officials told reporters that they could not tell how many of those people stopped partway through and how many were unable to finish because of HealthCare.gov’s problems.

The numbers came out as the politics surrounding the health-care law has become more heated.

On Capitol Hill, House Democrats from across the ideological spectrum criticized the administration’s handling of the issue at a closed-door meeting Wednesday attended by David Simas, the White House deputy senior adviser for communications and strategy, and other administration aides.

Pelosi said that the more than 200 Democrats in her caucus have grown restless and are firing off their ideas to administration officials about what to do next. “We’ve all been making suggestions. We know what the possibilities are, but I don’t know what they will choose. It’s a long list — how many members do I have?” she told reporters.

On Thursday, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough is scheduled to meet privately with Senate Democrats to discuss the law’s implementation.

Democratic irritation with the White House is mounting as the House prepares to vote Friday on a bill sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) that would permit insurers to continue to sell health plans after this year even if they don’t meet new federal standards. Democratic leadership aides predicted that at least some Democrats will support the measure.

In the Senate, Democrats have offered proposals to calm consumers who are angry about canceled plans. Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) introduced a bill Wednesday that would require insurers to give customers the chance to renew enrollment on certain health plans through the end of 2015. A measure sponsored by Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) would require insurers to allow Americans to renew their plans indefinitely.

At the White House, Carney said that “we welcome sincere efforts” in Congress. He did not specify when Obama plans to announce his approach but said, “When the president says or asks his team to work quickly to come up with policy options, people respond quickly to that request.”

The jockeying came as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Wednesday grilled several administration officials overseeing the technical work on the federal exchange. One of them, U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, an adviser to the president, turned up only after the committee’s chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), issued a subpoena demanding his presence. Park re­iterated the administration’s assertion that the Web site will be working smoothly for the “vast majority” of Americans by the end of the month, but he sidestepped repeated requests to be more precise.

The spotlight at the hearing was trained, in part, on an official with direct oversight of the technical aspects of the Web site: Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Republicans on the panel accused Chao and Park of not including adequate protections for consumers' privacy. They suggested that political considerations came into play when officials were deciding which features would be available on Day One. At times, they referenced testimony Chao gave during a recent closed-door session that lasted nine hours.

Chao, who has worked at CMS for two decades, repeatedly said that his comments were taken out of context and that he was not worried about the privacy of consumers' personal information. ""There was some rearrangement of the words that I used,"" he said."

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Obama administration's broader cooperation with insurers is a tacit acknowledgment that the federal insurance exchange — fraught with software and hardware flaws that have frustrated many Americans trying to buy coverage — might not be working smoothly by the target date of Nov. 30, according to several health experts familiar with the administration's thinking.

White House officials reject the idea that the strategy represents a contingency plan in the event that the online system continues to falter.

“We are working 24-7 to ensure that the site is working smoothly for the vast majority of users by the end of November,” said Chris Jennings, deputy assistant to the president for health policy. He said the administration remains confident that the site, HealthCare.gov, will be ready by the end of the month and that the White House always envisioned insurers’ direct enrollment of customers would be important to the law’s success.

The government has said for months that consumers would be able to go directly to insurance companies to buy the health plans offered on the exchange. But this was always imagined as a secondary route, along with call centers and in-person enrollment assistants.

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

If insurers’ sites became a main way to buy coverage, it would undermine the side-by-side comparison shopping — as is used on travel Web sites such Kayak — that HealthCare.gov is meant to promote. That’s because individual insurers are not obligated to tell their customers about competing health plans available. They are required only to advise consumers that other plans exist and can be found on HealthCare.gov.

Insurers are eager to take on a larger role. But they, like consumers, have been stymied by the online system’s technical problems. During one step in enrolling customers — determining whether their income qualifies them for government help with paying for health plans — insurers must connect to part of the federal online system, and that part does not work. White House officials and insurance industry leaders have been talking about how to solve this problem, perhaps on a temporary basis, and insurers are insisting that they be allowed to keep any extra subsidy money they might accidentally be paid, said people familiar with these discussions who, like others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the topic’s sensitive nature.

The 2010 Affordable Care Act requires most Americans to have health insurance, and December is a vital period. Those who are uninsured must buy plans by Dec. 15 to be covered by Jan. 1, the date the requirement begins. Those who do not buy coverage by March 31 will face financial penalties. The question is whether everyone will be able to meet those requirements if the Web site's problems persist.

The possibility of using health plans to directly sign up large numbers of uninsured Americans is a strategy by the administration and the insurance industry to try to deflect growing pressure from Capitol Hill. Even some Democratic lawmakers want to give people more time to buy coverage. And Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) introduced legislation late last week that would eliminate the tax penalty for next year, imposing a higher fine in 2015.

Such delays are anathema to the insurance industry, whose leaders have warned that companies would end up with mainly sicker people signing up early on.

Advertisement

Although potentially enabling more people to buy health plans promptly, a greater reliance on the industry to sign up new customers could have other ripple effects, such as prompting ads that might run counter to the administration’s messaging.

""One key question is whether insurance company advertising will accurately reflect the benefits people can get from the Affordable Care Act or if they will attempt to use fear and uncertainty to push people into a particular plan to increase their profits at customers' expense,"" said Eddie Vale, a strategist with Protect Your Care, an advocacy group that promotes the law.

In recent days, several people familiar with work on the Web site — all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly — said that the system is improving but that they cannot say definitively that all of the problems will be fixed by the target date.

“We’re working to make as much progress as possible by November 30, and quite frankly, beyond November 30,” one said, adding, “It’s a critical date, without question, but don’t think of it as an unveiling date. The goal is to make significant improvements by that day.”

Jeffrey Zients, whom the White House assigned to oversee the Web site's repairs, told reporters on Oct. 25 that by the end of November, HealthCare.gov ""will operate smoothly for the vast majority of consumers."" On Friday, he told reporters that an increased volume of visitors had exposed additional problems with the site and that it was ""a long way from where it needs to be.""

Some supporters of the health-care law think a back-up plan makes sense. The promised timeline for getting the Web site to work smoothly ""is really tough, given the depth of the problems that have been uncovered,"" said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of Avalere Health, a health-care consultant. ""What is becoming evident is, even if it is largely fixed by the end of November, it is unlikely to be seamless. . . . The administration needs to shift to other, assisted methods [for buying health plans], so they can get this thing back on track, and de-escalate focus on the Web site.""

Last Tuesday, Jennings and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough attended the board meeting of the insurance industry's main trade group, America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), according to several people familiar with the private meeting who said that they talked, in part, about how to fix the technical problems enough so that health plans could play a larger role.

Insurers, some of whom have circulated memos recently laying out possible contingency plans, are reluctant to talk publicly about details of their conversations with White House officials. “We are continuing to work with the administration to get direct enrollment up and running,” said AHIP spokesman Robert Zirkelbach, declining to discuss specifics.

Officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and federal contractors are furiously working to tackle the site's problems, said an administration official with knowledge of the project who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss operational details.

Hundreds of people are working at several sites in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs, the official added, with “people coming in and out as a result of niche expertise.” The goal, the official said, is to ensure that by the end the month a consumer could complete the enrollment process in “one continuous process, at any time of their choosing.”

As part of the effort, the official said, several insurance companies have recently dispatched technical experts to the Washington area at the federal government’s request, to sit with government workers and contractors. Their focus, the official said, is on improving the parts of the Web site needed for insurers to enroll customers directly, as well as error-ridden daily reports meant to tell each insurer who has just enrolled.

Starting this week, another administration official said, experts who write code for insurers will work directly with those writing code for HealthCare.gov, to address these problems on the back end of the system.

Dignity Health chief executive Lloyd Dean, who runs one of the nation's largest hospital systems and is a close ally of President Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, said he is confident that the administration has sufficient political and technological firepower focused on the enrollment system.

“The president is asking the right questions about the process, the strategy, the importance of bringing the resources to bear on the problem. He does not need to be a technical expert who can go to the data level. He now has those resources in place,” Dean said in an interview. “There is a master plan on how to address this issue. And that’s being tested every day.”

Quality Software Services, which the Health and Humans Services Department installed a few weeks ago as the general contractor overseeing the project, has put teams of people on several of the system's biggest defects, one person said. These groups — which include contractors, administration officials and a handful of experts from firms such as Google, Red Hat and Oracle — focus on specific targets while larger teams keep an eye out for major problems that require additional help or span different elements of the site.

On their own, insurers can help consumers through almost the entire enrollment process, but they need to rely on the federal online system for people to enter their incomes and find out whether the government will pay for part of their health plan. Since the enrollment period began Oct. 1, insurers have not had access to that feature — and, as a result, some have a lineup of potential customers unable to choose a plan and complete their purchase.

Part of the discussions lately between insurers and administration officials has been about what to do if that function is not fixed soon. One idea circulated within the insurance industry would be for HHS to approve a method to estimate subsidies and give preliminary tax credits based on those estimates — with the accurate amount determined later, once the system works better."

Nov 05 2018,"Pro-Life, Healthcare Agendas Hang in the Balance in Razor-Thin Nevada Senate Race",CBN,right,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2018/november/pro-life-healthcare-agendas-hang-in-the-balance-in-razor-thin-nevada-senate-race,"LAS VEGAS – The Senate race in Nevada is razor-thin, with Democratic candidate Jacky Rosen hoping to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Dean Heller in a state Hillary Clinton narrowly won in 2016.

""I would say it's a close race with some wind in our back,"" Heller told CBN News.

Both candidates are campaigning with big names from their parties, like President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama. Heller was an open critic of Trump during his 2016 campaign and says while he and the president may have had their differences and arguments in the past, things are different now.

""It's no secret. I probably wasn't one of his biggest fans when we were going through his campaign,"" acknowledged Heller. ""But then something happened, and that is we started to have some successes together – successes when it came to taxes; successes on bills for our veterans.""

""All the sudden these successes developed into trust and once you develop trust you develop friendship, and that's where we are today,"" he said.

The president nudged Sen. Heller to change his stance and support GOP efforts to repeal parts of the Affordable Healthcare Act. Rosen is making that vote a centerpiece for her campaign since Nevada majorly benefited from Obamacare's Medicaid expansion provision.

""Sen. Heller caved on protecting healthcare,"" Rosen said recently at a rally. ""Sen. Heller is guilty of the biggest broken promise in Nevada history.""

And while campaigning with former Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, Rosen also accused Heller of breaking a promise to protect federal funding for the abortion giant – a promise Heller denies ever making.

""The National Right to Life has supported me for 12 years since I've been in Congress,"" Heller said. ""So whatever this Planned Parenthood thing that they're making up – and let me assure you, they make it up – they're not just blaming me for Planned Parenthood or breaking promises with healthcare, they're doing this with every Republican across the nation because it was poll-tested out of Washington, DC, whether it was true or not.""

Rosen and Heller both agree, however, the future of the president's agenda hinges on the Nevada race.

""The future of our Supreme Court, the future of the Affordable Care Act – all of it, every single bit of it is on the line in this election,"" Rosen told supporters.

""The key to controlling the Senate is obviously to make sure we have good conservative judges, good conservative judges that believe in the Constitution,"" explained Heller.

Heller, who has won nine previous elections, tells CBN News that while this race is close, he feels confident of another victory"

Obamacare’s second open enrollment period began over the weekend, and thus far officials say the website hasn’t been plagued by the same troubles that turned it into a punch line last year.

“I think the vast majority of people coming to the site were able to get on and do what they intended to do,” Ms. Burwell said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

She added that about 500,000 people who already have health insurance were able to successfully log on and view their accounts. Ms. Burwell’s comments underscore the administration’s desire to paint a much different narrative around the website than the one that emerged last year, when HealthCare.gov was overrun by glitches and essentially was unusable for the first few weeks of the Obamacare rollout.

President Obama also has made a personal pitch in recent days, telling Americans the site has been improved and Obamacare coverage is worth seeking out.

“You might be able to save more money,” the president said Saturday in his weekly address.

Dec 29 2013,Obama administration: HealthCare.gov did its job during crucial week of sign-ups,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/27/white-house-website-did-job-crucial-week-sign-ups/,"The Obama administration said Friday that HealthCare.gov, the main website tied to Obamacare, did “what it was supposed to do” in handling a rush of users this past week.

Officials are touting the federal portal’s performance after a rocky debut in October bled into November, hurting consumers’ chances of enrolling in private plans on the new marketplace.

Users flooded the website on Monday and Tuesday, hoping to beat the deadline for signing up and holding coverage by the start of the new year. People have until March 31 to enroll under Obamacare, but some Americans faced a coverage gap in January because they lost existing health plans that did not meet the law’s coverage requirements.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Monday was its peak day — with more than 2 million site visits to HealthCare.gov — although some people had to wait in line to use the site.

“For those queued, wait times were generally less than five to ten minutes and users were given the option of receiving an email telling them when they could come back and get right in,” CMS spokeswoman Julie Bataille said Friday in a blog post. “There were 129,000 people who took advantage of this opportunity and were invited back the same day to finish their applications.”

The site had 880,000 total visits on Christmas Eve, with no queuing, according to the blog.

SPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care Reform

“There’s no question that, over this past weekend, Monday, and Tuesday, HealthCare.gov met the mark and did exactly what it was supposed to do — helping Americans from across the country find secure, quality health insurance coverage at an affordable price,” Ms. Bataille wrote.

Apr 10 2020,Black women have long faced racism in healthcare. COVID-19 is only amplifying it.,The Appeal,center,https://theappeal.org/black-women-coronavirus-healthcare/,"A Brooklyn teacher tried three times to get treatment for the coronavirus. Now she’s fighting for her life.

Update: Rana Zoe Mungin died on April 27 due to complications stemming from COVID-19.

By the time Rana Zoe Mungin called 911 on March 19, she could hardly breathe. The 30-year-old social studies teacher had been at home in Brooklyn, sick with a fever, cough, and shortness of breath for nearly a week. Days earlier, she had gone to urgent care, worried she had signs of COVID-19, but the clinic was short on tests and treated her for an asthma attack instead.

Mungin’s condition worsened, and because she was too weak to take the subway to the nearest hospital, she called 911. When the ambulance arrived, the EMTs were convinced it was a panic attack, not COVID-19. One of them sat with Mungin, who is Black, asking her questions to help her calm down. When he asked her about her long-term dreams and goals, she replied through labored breath, “My goal is not to die today.”

The EMTs left her to head to their next call. Still determined to get help, Mungin found her own way to the emergency room at Brookdale Hospital. There, she was placed in an area with people who had tested positive for COVID-19 but was not tested herself. Doctors said her lungs sounded clear. Terrified she would contract the virus if she hadn’t already, she went home.

Less than 24 hours later, she was on a ventilator, fighting for her life in that same hospital. Mia Mungin said the attending physician told her that her sister “was the sickest patient they had.”

Across the United States, Black women like Mungin have long faced significant social, economic, and racial barriers to receiving healthcare. Wage disparities, lack of access to hospitals and doctors’ offices, and the chronic stress of racism and implicit biases from providers all contribute to worse healthcare outcomes for Black women versus their white peers. Now, doctors and policymakers are concerned that those factors are compounding in the COVID-19 pandemic, creating greater gaps in care, and potentially increasing the virus’s spread.

My goal is not to die today. Zoe Mungin Brooklyn teacher



Few places are tracking COVID-19 cases by race, but those that are show startling numbers of cases among Black people. In Milwaukee, where just over a quarter of the population is Black, data released on April 9 shows that Black people made up at least 45 percent of COVID-19 cases and accounted for 61 percent of fatalities. Other predominantly Black communities, like in New Orleans and Detroit, have become hot spots for the disease.

For many Black women, the trio of an elevated risk of exposure, lack of access to testing, and a higher likelihood of underlying health conditions make COVID-19 particularly threatening.

The disease “spreads in places where folks are in contact with other people,” says Cicily Hampton, chief policy and programs officer at the Society for Public Health Education. “Who relies on public transport? Who are essential workers? Those women and men on the front line in grocery stores, or at the pickup counter in restaurants are Black and brown people.”

Those low-wage, frontline jobs also tend to lack the kind of benefits that can help stop the spread of the virus, like health insurance or paid sick leave, Hampton explained. “If someone has a fever and a cough, but they have rent to pay and children to feed, they’re going to get up and go to work. They don’t have the luxury of a sick day.”

She says fears about the cost of treatment also keep people away. “If you don’t know if your bill is going to be $100 or $1,000, and you don’t have that money to spare, you’re going to stay away.”

Even if someone who thinks they’ve been exposed can take time off to seek care, Black populations are more likely to live in areas where residential segregation has led to healthcare shortages, or lower-quality clinics and hospitals. Public institutions have been critically short on supplies in the pandemic—including test kits for the coronavirus.

After her sister was admitted to the hospital, Mia tried to get tested, but the hospital told her they were short on kits. “Stars on TV with no symptoms get tested, no problem,” she said. “But if you’re poor, you can’t get tested unless you’re nearly on death’s door.”

The major risk factor that makes coronavirus more deadly for those who catch it is underlying illness, and Black Americans are at higher risk for chronic conditions, like asthma, cardiovascular disease and diabetes than their white counterparts.

Those chronic illnesses can be caused or exacerbated by the toxic stress of racism, explained Jamila Taylor, director of healthcare reform and senior fellow at the Century Foundation. “We can’t have these conversations about racial disparities without centering them in racism, in both the healthcare system and broader society. The cumulative effects of racism cause wear and tear on our bodies, and make us more susceptible to chronic illness,” she said, pointing to a seminal research study on racism and inflammation.

A quality healthcare experience means a patient is listened to. Jamila Taylor director of healthcare reform and senior fellow at the Century Foundation



Often the most pernicious obstacle, the one that affects Black women regardless of their income, education, or baseline health, is what Mungin faced in her attempts to get treatment: simply not being believed or deemed worthy of treatment.

“A quality healthcare experience means a patient is listened to,” said Taylor. But for Black people, “their pain and discomfort are often ignored” by physicians, or assumed to be less severe than they describe. And providers often equate being Black with being poor, uneducated, drug seeking, pushy, or noncompliant.

This implicit bias affects Black women across socioeconomic strata, often with dire consequences. Donna A. Patterson, director of Africana studies at Delaware State University pointed to the pro tennis player Serena Williams, who tried to alert nurses to potential blood clots in her lungs after giving birth. “Serena Williams knew she had a blood clot and they brushed her off. She’s famous, she’s educated, she’s a multimillionaire, but she’s a Black woman, so they didn’t listen to her.”

Lawmakers are concerned that the number of COVID-19 cases in Black communities are being underreported and undertreated, leaving everyone more vulnerable. On March 27, five members of Congress, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Ayanna Pressley, both from Massachusetts, sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, calling on them to monitor and address racial disparities in the nation’s response to the outbreak.

“Any attempt to contain COVID-19 in the United States will have to address its potential spread in low-income communities of color,” the letter states, “first and foremost to protect the lives of people in those communities, but also to slow the spread of the virus in the country as a whole.”

But Hampton fears for the worst. “I think we’re going to see huge losses in low-income communities of color who are impacted by this,” she said. “People are losing their health insurance; public clinics aren’t getting tests. We are going to see huge inequalities when all the numbers are crunched on this.”

After a concerted effort by family, friends and alumnae from Wellesley College, where Mungin received her undergraduate degree, she was transferred to Mount Sinai to receive ECMO therapy, an advanced form of life support that can give her lungs time to heal. Nearly three weeks later, she is still on a ventilator in the ICU.

Mia, who is a registered nurse, tweets daily updates about her sister’s condition intermixed with requests for prayers. “At this moment, we are all just praying for her survival. That’s all we can do,” she said."
Jul 18 2017,"Senate will vote to repeal Obamacare without replacement, after new healthcare bill stumbles",The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/17/republican-health-bill-senators-oppose-vote,"Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has announced that the Senate will vote on a clean repeal of Obamacare without any replacement, after two Republican senators broke ranks to torpedo the current Senate healthcare bill.

Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran of Kansas came out on Monday night in opposition to McConnell’s Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), the Senate version of the controversial healthcare reform bill that passed the House in May.

Republicans hold a bare 52-48 majority in the upper chamber and two members of the GOP caucus, the moderate Susan Collins of Maine and the libertarian Rand Paul of Kentucky, already opposed the bill, along with all 48 Democrats. The announcement from Moran and Lee made it impossible for Republicans to muster the 50 votes needed to bring the BCRA to the floor.

Instead, McConnell announced late on Monday night that the Senate would vote on a bill to simply repeal Obamacare without any replacement in the coming days.

The Kentucky Republican said in a statement: “Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful.”

He added that “in the coming days” the Senate would vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act with a two-year-delay. The Senate passed a similar bill in 2015, which was promptly vetoed by Barack Obama.

McConnell’s plan echoes a statement made by Donald Trump in a tweet on Monday night, in which the president urged a repeal of Obamacare with any replacement to come in the future.

“Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!” Trump wrote.

In January, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that repealing Obamacare without a replacement would result in 32 million people losing insurance by 2026, including 19 million who would lose Medicaid coverage.

It would also cause premiums to rise by as much as 50% in the year following the elimination of key planks of the healthcare law, including the repeal of Medicaid expansion and cost-sharing subsidies. Premiums would nearly double over a decade.

The CBO said this would happen in large part because the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to have health insurance, would be repealed, while some insurers are likely to pull out of the market. As a result of the changes, many of those remaining enrolled would likely be older and sicker, which the CBO expected would cause insurers to raise rates dramatically.

Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2017

The announcement from Lee and Moran came as Trump was having dinner at the White House with a number of senators who support the bill. Trump talked to several conservatives on the phone over the weekend, including Lee, in an attempt to win their support.

In a tweet, Lee noted that he could not support “this version” of the bill. Moran used the same language on Twitter. Both voted for a clean repeal of the Affordable Care Act in 2015, albeit with the expectation that it would be vetoed by Obama and not become law.

In an op-ed for the Resurgent, a conservative online publication, Lee cited the fact that the current bill did not incorporate an amendment that he introduced with Ted Cruz to allow insurance companies to offer bare-bones insurance plans. In Lee’s argument, the mandate that insurance companies cover pre-existing conditions resulted in “a hidden tax” which meant that “middle-class families are being forced to pay billions in higher health insurance premiums to help those with pre-existing conditions”.

In a statement, Moran took a slightly different tack. He said: “There are serious problems with Obamacare, and my goal remains what it has been for a long time: to repeal and replace it. This closed-door process has yielded the BCRA, which fails to repeal the Affordable Care Act or address healthcare’s rising costs.” The Kansas Republican also warned that the current legislation “leave[s] the federal government in control of everyday healthcare decisions”, which he said made it “more likely that our healthcare system will devolve into a single-payer system, which would require a massive federal spending increase”.

The announcement came shortly after a Senate vote on the healthcare bill was delayed due to the hospitalization of John McCain. The Arizona senator had a blood clot removed from above his left eye on Friday night and was unable to fly to Washington as a result. On Saturday, McConnell said the Senate would “defer consideration” of the bill while McCain recovered. A number of other moderate Republican senators have yet to take positions on the bill, most notably Dean Heller of Nevada.

Although a repeal of Obamacare without providing for a immediate replacement has long been popular with conservatives, many other Republicans have been skeptical of this approach because of the potential political cost.

In contrast, McCain said in a statement that Republicans should start the process of passing a healthcare bill over. “Congress must now return to regular order [and] hold hearings,” said the Arizona Republican.

In a statement, the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, said: “This second failure of Trumpcare is proof positive that the core of this bill is unworkable.”

He added: “Rather than repeating the same failed, partisan process yet again, Republicans should start from scratch and work with Democrats on a bill that lowers premiums, provides long-term stability to the markets and improves our healthcare system.”

On Tuesday morning, Trump returned to the subject, writing: “We were let down by all of the Democrats and a few Republicans. Most Republicans were loyal, terrific & worked really hard. We will return!

“As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!”

Sep 23 2021,‘We Will Be Replacing People’: NY Gov. Says Healthcare Workers Who Won’t Take The Vaccine Will Get The Boot,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2021/09/23/kathy-hochul-new-york-healthcare-workers-replacing-people-vaccine-mandate/,"Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned Wednesday while visiting a Rochester hospital that healthcare workers who do not get vaccinated by the Sept. 27 deadline are replaceable.

“To all the healthcare providers, doctors and nurses in particular who are vaccinated, I say thank you. Because you are keeping true to your oath.”

“To those who won’t, we will be replacing people,” she added, according to CBS 6 Albany.

Hochul said the state is working on replacing unvaccinated health care workers and would be working with hospitals that do not have a shortage of staff, according to the report. She also noted the possibility of getting more work visas available for foreign healthcare workers.

“We are sending out a call statewide. There are facilities, for example in New York City, that 98% of their staff are vaccinated, they don’t have a worker shortage. We are working closely with these hospitals to find out where we can get other individuals to come in and supplement nursing homes and other facilities.”

Hochul made a similar statement Tuesday while visiting the Niagara Power Project, according to WGRZ.

“To those who refuse we will find replacements,” she reportedly said.

Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the mandate in mid-August just days before he resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. Hochul has maintained the mandate remain in place, with it set to go into effect Sept. 27. There is no testing alternative.

Some hospitals expect to face worker shortages once the mandate goes into effect.

The Erie County Medical Center paused impatient elective surgeries and ICU transfers, telling WGRZ they anticipate 400 staff members who are choosing to not take the vaccine to leave the hospital. (RELATED: Vaccine Mandate Protests Explode Across New York City, With Some Chanting ‘F*ck Joe Biden’)

The hospital is also advising patients seek treatment at urgent care centers or other medical facilities due to the shortages.

“It’s hard to discharge people out of the facility since the nursing homes and groups homes also have shortages,” Chief Operating Officer Andy Davis told Business First. “We have about 30 patients (requiring) alternative levels of care. They shouldn’t be in our setting, but we have placement issues and can’t go other places, so that’s causing this backlog, as well as the mandate coming up.”

Federal Judge David Hurd issued an order Sept. 14 temporarily blocking the mandate for healthcare workers after a group sued arguing their the mandate was unconstitutional, since it doesn’t allow for religious exemptions. The judge gave the state until Sept. 22 to respond to the suit in federal court."
Nov 13 2013,"Fox News Continues To Falsely Label Healthcare Law ""Government-Run Health Insurance""",Media Matters,left,http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/11/13/fox-news-continues-to-falsely-label-aca-governm/196881,"Fox News' Chris Stirewalt adopted the false, GOP-inspired label of “government run health insurance” during Fox's coverage of House hearings on the Affordable Care Act health reform rollout.

On the November 13 edition of America's Newsroom, host Martha MacCallum used a House hearing on the health exchange website to ask Stirewalt to comment on problems in the rollout of Obamacare's exchanges. Stirewalt claimed that problems accessing the website are a major problem because people have been “compelled against their wishes to purchase government run health insurance.”

But the ACA is not “government-run” health insurance. The Affordable Care Act creates exchanges in which consumers can purchase health insurance that will be managed and operated by private health insurers. The Washington Post's Fact Checker blog pointed out that the ACA “builds on the existing private insurance” much like Massachusetts health insurance reform of 2006. Politfact called the claim that the ACA is a “government takeover of health care” the 2010 “Lie of the Year,” explaining that the law “relies largely on the free market”:

Employers will continue to provide health insurance to the majority of Americans through private insurance companies. Contrary to the claim, more people will get private health coverage. The law sets up “exchanges” where private insurers will compete to provide coverage to people who don't have it. The government will not seize control of hospitals or nationalize doctors. The law does not include the public option, a government-run insurance plan that would have competed with private insurers. The law gives tax credits to people who have difficulty affording insurance, so they can buy their coverage from private providers on the exchange. But here too, the approach relies on a free market with regulations, not socialized medicine.

A Media Mattersstudy found that this misleading description of health care reform came from a memo released by conservative pollster Frank Luntz. Internal memos in 2010 from Fox executives showed that Fox pushed reporters to use the biased phrase “government-run health insurance” in place of official terms."
Nov 12 2013,"About 40,000 Americans are said to have signed up for plans on HealthCare.gov",Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/about-40000-americans-are-said-to-have-signed-up-for-plans-on-healthcaregov/2013/11/11/622ec9dc-4b1b-11e3-9890-a1e0997fb0c0_story.html?hpid=z1,"An earlier version of this article identified Rep. Dave Camp as a Wisconsin Republican. He is from Michigan. This version has been corrected.

Roughly 40,000 Americans have signed up for private insurance through the flawed federal online insurance marketplace since it opened six weeks ago, according to two people with access to the figures. That amount is a tiny fraction of the total projected enrollment for the 36 states where the federal government is running the online health-care exchange, indicating the slow start to the president's initiative. The first concrete evidence of the popularity — and accessibility — of the new federal insurance exchange emerged as the White House has been preparing to release this week the first official tally of how many people have chosen coverage using the Web site, HealthCare.gov.

One administration official said Monday that the official figure will include people who have paid for a health plan and those who simply picked a plan and put it in their online shopping cart.

The administration's only known previous projections come from internal memos, released on Capitol Hill, that predicted that about a half-million Americans would have selected insurance by the end of October. It was unclear whether that figure, cited in a letter last month by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.), included only people who enrolled in private health plans or also low-income people who joined Medicaid.

The figure of 40,000 disclosed Monday did not include Medicaid sign-ups. At least 440,000 people have signed up for Medicaid through the health-care initiative, according to Avalere Health, a consulting firm that has been tracking sign-ups. Budget forecasters have projected that in 2014 there will be a much more even balance between private insurance and Medicaid participants.

In recent days, officials inside the White House and at the Department of Health and Human Services have been working to dampen public expectations for enrollment, in light of a rollout of the online marketplace that they have acknowledged has been disastrous. HealthCare.gov has been riddled with hardware and software problems that have stymied many Americans trying to shop for or purchase a health plan.

""I can tell you our early enrollment numbers are going to be very low,"" HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified last week before a Senate committee.

According to one person with knowledge of the figures, slightly fewer than 40,000 people had selected a health plan as of last week. The figures are derived from reports that the government sends to each participating insurer early every evening, letting them know which customers have signed up that day. The figure was first reported Monday by the Wall Street Journal.

White House and HHS officials declined to confirm the 40,000 figure. HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields Britt reiterated what has become the administration’s talking points in recent days. She noted that the exchange’s technical problems have hindered enrollment — and that sign-ups also were slow when Massachusetts several years ago became the first state to run a similar insurance exchange.

In comparison, 14 states and the District are operating separate exchanges, and an analysis released Monday by Avalere shows that about 49,000 people have signed up for coverage in those exchanges — representing about 3 percent of the eventual expected enrollment in those states. Although the state exchanges have varied in how easy they are to use, few have been marred by technical problems as severe as the federal HealthCare.gov. Of those exchanges, the District has had the smallest proportion of anticipated insurance-seekers sign up, with 300 people — or 1 percent — enrolled as of the end of last week. Richard Sorian, a spokesman for DC Health Link, said that ""most people do not have the luxury of paying for coverage in October, months before a bill is due."" The analysis, however, includes people who have picked a plan but not yet paid for it.

The federal figures reflect the earliest — and in some cases, most persistent — of the Americans who have a six-month open-enrollment period, ending March 31, to buy insurance through the online federal marketplace. This exchange is intended primarily for people who do not have access to health coverage through a job, many of whom will be able for the first time to get government help in paying for insurance.

Under the health-care law, most Americans will be required to have insurance, and people who have not purchased any by the end of March will face financial penalties. The new insurance will take effect Jan. 1 for those who sign up by mid-December.

The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 7 million Americans will gain private coverage through the federal exchange and state exchanges by spring — and 22 million within a few years.

A spokesman for the insurance industry's main trade group said the slow early enrollment does not matter as much as how many sign up by the spring. ""That's what will determine how well these reforms are going to work,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the group America's Health Insurance Plans.

The insurance industry has a substantial stake in who enrolls, as well as how many do so. Unless enough young, healthy Americans sign up, the cost of coverage is likely to escalate — in turn, discouraging people from getting or keeping coverage."
Nov 04 2013,"One month of HealthCare.gov horrors -- time for Obama to apologize, meet with Republicans",Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/11/01/one-month-healthcaregov-horrors-time-for-obama-apologize-meet-with-republicans/,"It’s now been officially one month since President Obama launched his health insurance exchange and broken website. Over the past few weeks, it’s become clear that the problems with the health care law go well beyond a failed website. The technical problems are just the tip of the iceberg.

Nearly every promise made by the Obama administration has been broken.

The president’s latest speeches and the testimony of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have just amounted to more spin.

[pullquote]

The health exchange has not been as easy to use as Amazon.com.

People are finding their plans are not as cheap as a cell phone bill.

Their family’s doctors may not even be covered by their new insurance.

President Obama should admit to the American people that his law doesn’t provide the affordable, accessible health care coverage that they wanted all along. Then he should come to the table with Republicans to give people the real health care reform that they need, that they want, and that they deserve.

As we all remember, President Obama also promised repeatedly that if you liked the insurance you had, you could keep it. It turns out that only if the White House likes your plan can you keep it – if not, you’re out of luck. In fact, the Administration knew for years that up to 16 million people across the country could lose their insurance. Rather than being honest with the American people, they chose to hide the problem.

Now millions of people who are getting cancellation letters from their insurance company know the truth. In New Jersey alone, 800,000 cancellation letters have gone out.

When these people and others start shopping for new insurance, many will find the premiums are much higher. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina told one customer that his current plan doesn’t meet benefit requirements of the President’s health care law. It suggested a comparable plan for $1,208 a month – $980 more than he pays now.

A woman in California faced a 50 percent rate hike. She wrote to her insurance company, “I was all for Obamacare until I found out I was paying for it.”

For a lot of people, the law means more than skyrocketing premiums. Their new policies will come with higher co-pays and bigger deductibles – triple what they have now in some cases.

After people recover from the sticker shock of their new Washington-approved and mandated insurance, there will be more negative consequences. Many will find that their own doctor is no longer eligible to treat them under their plan. A recent survey of physician practices found that only 29 percent say they’ll take insurance sold through the government exchange. The rest have either decided not to participate or are still making up their minds.

Finally, if all that weren’t bad enough, people trying to buy insurance through the exchange face increased risk of fraud and identity theft. Con artists are taking advantage of the Obama Administration’s bungling by setting up fake websites and phishing scams.

The Democrats’ whole law was based on the idea that government is capable of running America’s health care system competently. It turns out that the government can’t even set up a website competently – and they knew it.

The Obama administration also knows that it will have to delay implementation of the individual mandate by at least a year. The failure has been too widespread to fix quickly. This delay needs to be approved by Congress through the regular legislative process. It should not be another case where the President waves his magic wand to change the law how he wants, when he wants.

Democrats got the American people into this mess unilaterally. It’s time for a bipartisan solution to get us out."

Schumer responded, saying he was willing to work with Trump to ""improve the existing health care system"" but not to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act, former president Barack Obama's signature 2010 health-care law.

Trump's outreach to Schumer comes after the president infuriated fellow Republicans by negotiating a deal last month with Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to raise the debt ceiling and fund the government.

Trump's dealings with “Chuck and Nancy,” as he affectionately called them, was seen by some congressional Republicans as an act of betrayal but have earned the president plaudits and framed him as the bipartisan dealmaker he said he would be.

Republicans control the House and Senate but have repeatedly failed to pass their health-care bill through the upper chamber. Their efforts to “repeal and replace Obamacare,” which for years has been the GOP's campaign mantra, so far have garnered no Democratic support.

But Schumer and other Democrats have said they would be open to discussions with Trump and other Republicans to consider selective changes to the ACA. This summer, Schumer publicly offered to negotiate with Trump if Republicans were willing to drop what he called a “fundamentally flawed approach.”

“Let's start over,” the Democratic leader said in June, challenging the president to invite Senate Democrats to Blair House for a meeting. “You think we're not serious? Try us. Democrats are ready to turn the page on health care.”"

Dec 03 2014,Kathleen Sebelius: Healthcare.gov was ‘like buying an airline ticket using your fax machine’,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/12/03/kathleen-sebelius-healthcare-gov-was-like-buying-an-airline-ticket-using-your-fax-machine/,"More than a year after the enormous uproar caused by the botched rollout of Healthcare.gov, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is weighing in on her rocky tenure — and on the controversial comments by Obamacare consultant Jonathan Gruber that have grabbed recent headlines. The whole USA Today interview is worth watching, but here’s a quick highlight reel:

On whether she felt like a scapegoat for the failures of Healthcare.gov:

Kathleen Sebelius: No. I think that I was the CEO of a big company with an important rollout and health care.gov was something that had been promised to work smoothly, to work like you were buying an airline ticket using your app on your computer. Instead it worked like buying an airline ticket using your fax machine.

On the description of Jonathan Gruber as an architect of the health care law:

KS: Dr. Gruber could be regarded as the architect of Romneycare, but he was a consultant, one of many, on the issues around how to frame the subsidies ... I know our staff did [meet with him] and I think he met with various advisers, but I did not meet with Jonathan Gruber. … Maybe he was in a large room, he could have been on a phone call. But in terms of small meetings, discussing policy, that never happened.”

On whether she's concerned about what Gruber might say when he testifies next week before a House committee:

KS: Well, clearly he is not a very articulate with the phrasing he uses. I have no idea what Dr. Gruber is going to say. But frankly I don’t think that it’s relevant in terms of his personal opinions of what happened. He was not author of the bill itself. He didn’t influence the members of Congress who actually wrote the legislation. He is making some headlines, which is unfortunate because I think he’s harming the very product that he helped to push forward.

...Every sentence, every syllable, every misstep, every opportunity to have adversaries of this law say, ""See we told you,"" is leapt upon. What I have found frustrating is there has never been a time in which those same individuals acknowledge the successes.

On whether ACA supporter Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) was right to say it had been a mistake to focus on the health care law for the first two years of President Obama's tenure:

KS: Chuck Schumer may not be the only one who said this was a mistake. There were certainly people very close to the president who said, Go small. Do a handful of children and get out. Do some 55-year-olds and get out. Move this along. And at every point along the way the president would ask the assembled group, is there a chance to get a comprehensive bill passed? And if so we have to take that chance. This is a moment I don’t want to miss."
Oct 15 2014,Texas health officials say second healthcare worker at Dallas hospital tests positive for Ebola,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/10/15/texas-health-officials-say-second-healthcare-worker-at-dallas-hospital-tests/,"A second female health care worker at the Dallas hospital where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was treated has tested positive for the virus, Texas health officials confirmed Wednesday, as the state prepares for the possibility of more cases.



“We are preparing contingencies for more and that is a very real possibility,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said during a press conference Wednesday morning.



""It may get worse before it gets better,"" said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings.



Officials did not specify what position the worker held at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, but they did say she was among those who provided care for Duncan, who died from the virus Oct. 8.

One of the health care worker's relatives identified her as Amber Vinson, a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital.

A check of public records by Reuters showed that Vinson lived at the apartment complex identified as the home of the latest patient. Public records indicate that she is 29 years old. Officials confirmed the second patient lived alone on the 6000th block of Village Bin Drive and without pets.

“Like Nina Pham [a nurse, and the first health care worker at the hospital to test positive for Ebola], this is a heroic person, a person who is dedicating her life to helping others and is a servant leader,” said Jenkins.



Officials confirmed that within 90 minutes of reporting a fever, the health care worker’s temperature was taken and she was placed in isolation.



Preliminary tests were run at the state public health lab in Austin and results came back at approximately midnight Wednesday. A separate test will be done this morning at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.



Officials have said the health care worker was interviewed quickly to identify any contacts or potential exposures, and that others will be monitored. The type of monitoring will depend on the nature of their interactions with the health care worker, and the potential of exposure to the virus.

Jenkins said health officials are currently monitoring more than 70 others who treated Duncan. These workers are employed but not working.



“You can imagine the anxiety of the families of these 77 people,” said Jenkins. “You can imagine the gut shot that this is to the family that is Presbyterian hospital has done a great job taking care of this community in many, many years.”



During the press conference, officials did not confirm the number of possible contacts with the worker.



Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the city has sent a team to her apartment to disinfect the patient’s home and the inside of her car, which will be removed this afternoon.



On Sunday, officials confirmed that Pham, 26, had tested positive for the virus. Pham received a blood transfusion from a recovered Ebola patient and has moved from “stable” to “good” condition, Jenkins said. Pham’s dog has also been isolated.



More than 70 people who may have had contact with Duncan at the hospital are currently being monitored. The 48 contacts outside of the hospital who may have had contact with Duncan are asymptomatic, and Sunday marks the end of the 21-day incubation period, during which Ebola symptoms can arise after direct contact.



Officials have not said when or how the second health care worker or Pham may have had contact with Duncan. But the second case pointed to lapses beyond how one individual may have donned and removed personal protective garb.



“There’s clear there was an exposure somewhere, sometime in the treatment of Mr. Duncan,” Dr. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer for Texas Health Presbyterian, said during the conference. “Let’s be clear, we’re a hospital that may have done some things different with the benefit of what we know today. But make no mistake, no one wants to get this right more than our hospital first to diagnose and treat this insidious disease that’s now attacked two of our own.”

The Ebola virus is transmitted when a person comes in direct contact with an infected, symptomatic Ebola patient’s bodily fluids, such as blood, sweat, saliva and tears.



News of the latest positive test comes one day after the largest U.S. nurses' union charged that Duncan's caregivers worked for days without proper protective gear and faced constantly changing protocols.



A statement from National Nurses United also says Duncan was left in an open area of an emergency room for hours.



A spokesman for the group says nurses were forced to use medical tape to secure openings in their flimsy garments. It's said that the patient had explosive diarrhea and projectile vomiting.

In a conference call with reporters executive director RoseAnn DeMoro says the allegations are based on revelations from ""a few"" nurses and that the claims were vetted.



The nurses also said that Duncan's lab samples were allowed to travel through the hospital's pneumatic tubes, opening the possibility of contaminating the specimen delivery system. The nurses also alleged that hazardous waste was allowed to pile up to the ceiling.



A hospital spokesman told the Associated Press that the facility had not received similar complaints.

Dec 03 2013,White House to launch new push to sell ObamaCare after HealthCare.gov re-do,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/03/white-house-to-pitch-obamacare-after-healthcaregov-re-do/,"His party's political fortunes and his own legacy on the line, President Obama launched a campaign on Tuesday to once again sell the benefits of ObamaCare to the public, and try to head off a backlash in 2014.

[audio-clip]

The president, speaking at a White House event flanked by supporters of the law, declared that the Affordable Care Act ""is working"" and that the flawed website will improve ""over time.""

""Tell your friends, tell your family -- do not let the initial problems with the website discourage you,"" Obama said.

But Republican leaders blasted the ""campaign-style"" push as doing little to address the widespread problems facing consumers.

More On This...

""It's not just a broken website, this bill is fundamentally flawed -- causing people to lose the doctor of their choice, causing them to lose their health plan. And if that isn't enough, they're having to pay much higher prices at the same time,"" House Speaker John Boehner said.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the law is ""broken beyond repair,"" and said repeal, followed by a new bill, is the best ""fix.""

Obama vowed that the law would not be repealed ""as long as I'm president.""

Republicans already are threatening to tar the Democratic Party with the health care law's troubled rollout. Obama, meanwhile, is in danger of becoming what Nancy Pelosi was in 2010 -- a party leader whom endangered Democrats in state and congressional races will run from, not with, in the midterms.

As former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell told Politico: ""If it were right now, I don't know that any Democrat running for governor would like the president involved."" A host of recent polls have shown Obama's approval ratings hitting record lows.

But the White House is trying to turn the debate around, after weeks of withering and widespread criticism over HealthCare.gov's technical problems and insurance policy cancellations.

After the White House event on Tuesday, the administration plans to spend the next several weeks drawing attention to the benefits of the law.

The president will also take aim at Republican-led efforts to repeal ObamaCare, arguing the GOP is trying to strip away benefits provided under the law without presenting an alternative proposal, one official said.

""Healthcare.gov met our self-imposed November 30th deadline and even as we continue to make improvements to the website, we'll also remind the public about how the Affordable Care Act is already making a positive difference in the lives of millions of Americans today,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement.

The campaign is aimed at making sure Americans don't shy away from the massive health care program which needs their support in order to thrive.

But the president also needs to change the dynamic in order to assure skittish Democrats that the law is something they can run on in 2014.

Some of the most heated criticism over the past two months has come from Democrats, who lambasted the HealthCare.gov problems and in some cases pushed legislation to delay key elements of the law.

Obama administration officials acknowledged HealthCare.gov is still a work in progress after a key deadline to fix the problems with the online health exchange. The administration had promised a vastly improved shopping experience on the website by the end of November.

The site appeared to generally run smoothly early Monday morning before glitches began slowing people down. By 10 a.m., federal health officials deployed a new queue system that stalls new visitors on a waiting page so that those further along in the process can finish their application with fewer problems.

About 750,000 had visited the site by Monday night - about double the traffic for a typical Monday, according to figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The first big test of the repaired website probably won't come for another couple of weeks, when an enrollment surge is expected as consumers rush to meet a Dec. 23 deadline so their coverage can kick in on the first of the year.

Avoiding a break in coverage is particularly important for millions of people whose current individual policies were canceled because they don't meet the standards of the health care law, as well as for a group of about 100,000 in an expiring federal program for high-risk patients.

With the midterm elections less than a year away, it's vital to Democrats that the site lives up to expectations the president set. Republicans have already suggested they'll launch coordinated attacks linking every congressional Democrat up for re-election to the Affordable Care Act.

""President Obama and his administration repeatedly claimed the ObamaCare website would be fully functioning by the end of November, but this has proven to be just another broken promise,"" RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Monday. ""The Obama administration had over three years to build Healthcare.gov, and all they've produced is a non-functioning website, wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars.""

Federal health officials have acknowledged the importance of fixing back-end problems as insurers struggle to process applications because of incomplete or inaccurate data. Even when consumers think they've gone through the whole process, their information may not get to the insurer without problems.

""We do know that things are not perfect with the site. We will continue to make improvements and upgrades,"" said Julie Bataille, communications director for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Fox News' Ed Henry and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
Nov 14 2013,"Obama Offers One Year Healthcare ""Fix,"" Says Buying Health Insurance Online is ""Complicated""",Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/11/14/obama-tries-to-regain-americas-trust-by-declaring-insurance-is-complicated-to-buy-n1746635,"Speaking today from the White House, President Obama touted dismal Obamacare enrollment numbers as proof people are interested in the healthcare law and assured millions Americans they can keep their cancelled insurance plans if insurance companies continue to offer and provide them.



“I said we would do everything we can to fix this problem and today I’m offering an idea that would help do it. Already people who pre-date the Affordable Care Act can keep those plans if they haven’t changed, that was already in the law. That’s what’s called a grandfather clause that was included in the law,” Obama said. “Today we’re going to extend that principle both people whose plans have changed since the law took effect so state insurance commissioners still have the power to decide what plans can and can’t be sold in their states but the bottom line is insurers can extend current plans that would otherwise be cancelled into 2014 and Americans whose plans have been cancelled can choose to re-enroll in the same kind of plan. We’re also requiring insurers to extend current plans to inform their customers about two things. One, that protections, what protections these renewed plans don’t include. Number two, that the [Obamacare] marketplace offers new options with better coverage and tax credits that might help you bring down the costs. So, if you received one of these letters, I encourage you to take a look at the marketplace, even if the website isn’t working as smoothly as it should be for everybody yet. The plan comparison tool that lets you browse costs for new plans near you is working just fine. Now this fix won’t solve every problem for every person but it’s going to help a lot of people. Doing more will require work with Congress.”



This fix is only for one year and expires in 2015, just in time for the 2014 midterm elections.

In short, President Obama will allow insurers to offer old plans (which are impossible to get back) so long as they push propaganda about the government run exchanges. Also, President Obama seems to think that because the government can force people buy health insurance, it can force insurance companies to sell it, which isn’t the case.



Obama's original and repeated promise before October 1, 2013 was, “If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.” Obama didn’t offer the “if” until millions of Americans started losing their healthcare plans.



The president quickly shifted blame and responsibility for reinstating cancelled plans to insurance companies and repeatedly dumped on the private individual health insurance marketplace that Obamacare is destroying.



“It is important to understand though that the old individual market as not working well and it’s important that we don’t pretend that that’s somehow a place worth going back to,” Obama said. ""It [the fix] allows us to be able to say to the folks who received these notices that I as the United States [and Obamacare] are not going to get in the way of you shopping for the insurance you used to have.”



When asked about the ongoing chaos of healthcare.gov, President Obama lamented that the issue isn’t simply about the website but about purchasing insurance online being “complicated.”



“Even if we get the site fixed, insurance in complicated to buy,"" Obama said. ""It is not possible for me to guarantee that hundreds of people going on the website will have a seamless process.”



Leading up to the launch of the Obamacare exchanges on October 1, the Obama administration argued buying healthcare on those exchanges would be as easy as buying a plane ticket on sites like Kayak or products on Amazon. Now they’re arguing it will never be that easy.



“It has now been six weeks since the Affordable Care Act’s new marketplace opened for business. I think it’s fair to say that the rollout has been rough so far and I think everybody understands that I am not happy about the fact that the rollout has been rout with a whole range of problems,” Obama said. “THe problems of the website have prevented too many people from completing the enrollment process but there’s no questions there’s a demand for quality affordable healthcare.”



Yesterday the White House released official Obamacare enrollment numbers showing just 27,000 people signed up through the federal healthcare exchange. A recent Gallup poll shows 78 percent of uninsured Americans aren’t interested in signing up for Obamacare.



President Obama admitted the administration “fumbled the rollout” but that many didn’t notice a number of things under Obamacare that are “working really well,” because those things aren’t controversial enough, citing prescription drug benefits and young adults staying on parental health insurance plans until they’re 26-years-old.



In response to a question about his plummeting approval numbers, President Obama said, ""In terms of impact on me, there are going to be ups and downs during the course of my presidency.""

UPDATE: Insurance companies are ticked."
Dec 12 2013,Issa to Sebelius on Healthcare.gov Probe: Failing to Turn Over Info is Criminal Obstruction of Justice,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2013/12/12/issa-to-sebelius-on-obamacare-probe-this-is-criminal-obstruction-of-justice-n1761577,"In a letter sent late Wednesday, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee Darrell Issa reminded Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that obstructing a congressional investigation is a crime.

Issa's Committee has been looking into the details of how Obamacare was implemented, along with the major problems with Healthcare.gov and has requested a number of documents from HHS, none of which he's received. The documents requested pertain to companies hired by HHS to build and operate Healthcare.gov.

""The Department [HHS] subsequently instructed those companies not to comply with the Committee's request. The Department's hostility toward questions from Congress and the media about the implementation of Obamcare is well known. The Department's most recent effort to stonewall, however, has morphed from mere obstinacy into criminal obstruction of a congressional investigation,"" Issa wrote.

The letter details a contract between HHS and Creative Computing Solutions, Inc. (CCSI) forcing the company to get approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services before cooperating with Congress, making it nearly impossible for lawmakers to get documents from the company directly. CCSI has been citing the contract as the reason why they cannot turn over requested documents to Congress. In the letter, Issa indicated this refusal by CCSI under the thumb of HHS could be criminal obstruction of a congressional investigation.

""The Departmen't instruction not to cooperate with congressional investigations relies on language in the contract with CCSI which precludes contractors from sharing certain data with third parties. Moreover, the Department explicitly forbids the release of documents without authorization from CMS. That argument -- that the language in the contract between the Department and a private company supersedes Congress' constitutional prerogative to conduct oversight -- is without merit,"" Issa wrote. ""In fact, it strains credulity to such an extent that it creates the appearance that the Department is using the threat of litigation to deter private companies from cooperating with Congress. The Department's attempt to threaten CCSI for the purpose of deterring the company from providing documents to Congress places the officials responsible for drafting and sending the letter on the wrong side of federal statues that prohibit obstruction of a congressional investigation. Obstructing a Congressional investigation is a crime.""

Issa instructed Sebelius to inform HHS officials to immediately stop directing employees and contractors not to turn over Healthcare.gov documents to Congress. He also reminded Sebelius that a subpoena was issued to her on October 30, 2013 and requires a response.

""Private citizens and companies cannot contract away their duty to comply with a congressional request for documents,"" Issa said. ""Furthermore, the Department's instruction to CCSI and other contractors not to respond to congressional document requests runs afoul of a federal statute that prohibits interfering with an employees' right to furnish information to Congress. Under that statute, any effort to enforce a contract that prevents a federal employee -- or in this case, a contractor -- from communicating with Congress is unlawful.""

Thursday, the Oversight Committee will hold a hearing about Obamacare's impact on premiums and provider networks as millions continue to see skyrocketing insurance rates, loss of health insurance and a loss of preferred doctors."

Jul 16 2017,Susan Collins breaks with Mike Pence: Senate GOP's healthcare bill 'would affect the most vulnerable',Washington Examiner,right,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/susan-collins-breaks-with-mike-pence-senate-gops-healthcare-bill-would-affect-the-most-vulnerable/article/2628791,"Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee would be damned if they asked questions, and they are being damned now for not asking questions. As clever as it is duplicitous, Democrats have forced a lose-lose scenario on the GOP ahead of the Brett Kavanaugh-Christine Blasey Ford hearing.

When Ford agreed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about allegations that Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her, the Left cried foul. Politicos and journalists and politicians all made different versions of the same complaint. The eleven Republicans who would be doing the questioning were A: old, B: white, and C: male.

Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., predicted that “hostile GOP men” would attack Ford.

[Read: Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford testifies: ‘Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes’]

Why did Dr. Ford just agree to testify even though 1) #GOP Senate Leader doesn’t care what she would say, 2) She will get more death threats, and 3) She will be subject to questioning by hostile GOP men about her traumatic & humiliating sexual assault? Because her story is true. https://t.co/snwm6i25Pp — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) September 22, 2018

Alexander Nazaryan, a national correspondent with Yahoo News, wondered just “how hard 11 men will work to discredit a single woman.”

The Associated Press reported that the questioning placed “the Republican Party’s woman problem is in the spotlight.”

Some Republicans are warning that their party’s strained relationship with women could suffer permanent damage if Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed. https://t.co/ldf5SlpWrR — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) September 27, 2018



By all accounts, it seemed that Republicans listened. They decided to turn over the questioning to a female lawyer experienced in dealing with such cases. They called on Rachel Mitchell, a sex crimes prosecutor from Maricopa County attorney’s office in Arizona.

The casual political observer would assume that this would satisfy the Left. After all, Mitchell knows infinitely more about the issue, and how to approach the issue with empathy, than any of the eleven Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee. The casual political observer would be wrong.

But Senate Democrats immediately panned the decision, and one can only suspect it is because they want to use Republicans’ performance in asking questions to suggest that they are somehow insensitive.

Mazie Hirono on CNN this morning: “Republicans do not want to question Dr. Ford directly because it will reveal who they are and I think they’re afraid of that.” — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 25, 2018

Republicans have hired an outside attorney to grill Dr. Ford, they’ve scheduled a vote on Judge Kavanaugh for Friday AM (the day after this hearing), and they’re limiting questions to 1 round of 5 min Qs Does that sound like they’re taking this seriously to you? Me neither. — Senator Chris Coons (@ChrisCoons) September 25, 2018

Republicans apparently decided it’s bad optics for 11 male senators—many of whom already judged Dr. Ford a liar—to question a survivor on live TV. Instead of personally facing her to ask questions, they are hiding behind a private lawyer whom they hired to do their jobs for them. https://t.co/EsIGF6umOD — Richard Blumenthal (@SenBlumenthal) September 21, 2018

Press and pundits followed up, suddenly incensed that Republicans had listened to their earlier complaints.

Symone Sanders, former spokesman for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, called them cowards.

The Republicans of the Senate Judiciary Committee are a bunch of internet bullies. They are cowards. It’s preposterous that they have to bring in outside counsel to ask Dr. Ford questions tomorrow. DR FORD IS NOT ON TRIAL!… — Symone D. Sanders (@SymoneDSanders) September 26, 2018



Lara Bazelon, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law, taunted Grassley and called on him to “man up” and “question Blasey Ford yourself.”

Handing off the questioning of Dr. Ford to female staff members would be based on the risible idea that the questioning of sexual assault survivors is “women’s work.” https://t.co/dr1q05HO2F — NYT Opinion (@nytopinion) September 25, 2018



By now it should be clear that there is nothing that Republicans can do to satisfy the complaints and answer the criticisms of the Left. Whatver the truth value of Ford’s allegations, this criticism reveals bad faith."

Vice President Mike Pence is working to reassure voters that last month's health care defeat is not the end of the fight to overhaul Obamacare. And President Donald Trump is doing his part too, meeting with one of the top GOP opponents of that defeated bill.

Pence primarily focused on jobs and building the economy during a weekend roundtable discussion in Reynoldsburg, Ohio. However, he said that the president will make good on his campaign promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

""It ain't over yet,"" Pence said. ""You can take that to the bank.""

Fox News reports the president will resort to more hardball tactics to get it replaced, including negotiating with Democrats and backing the congressional opponents of the members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who led the opposition to House leadership's overhaul bill.

Texas Republican Rep. Black Farenthold told Fox this tactic could further damage and alienate GOP conservatives in Congress. He fears that working with Democrats will only result in a more liberal-leaning bill.

""If you move further to the left, you're not just going to lose the Freedom Caucus,"" he said. ""You'll lose people like me.""

David Winston, a GOP strategist who advises congressional leaders, said it will be a long time before Republicans have to defend their congressional majorities. He says now is the time make strides in the right direction.

""We have the House, the Senate, the White House,"" he said. ""People are going to expect points on the board.""

Meanwhile, President Trump took to his Virginia golf course with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on Sunday to talk health care.

The outing came hours after he tweeted that talks about replacing the law ""will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.""

Trump added that anyone, especially ""the fake media,"" who thinks the effort is dead, ""does not know the love and strength in r party!""

Paul came out against the House GOP legislation but ended the day on a good note saying he his optimistic on the replacement of Obamacare."

Jun 25 2015,Fox News has a conspiracy theory for the ages: Obama secretly wants his healthcare law destroyed!,Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2015/06/25/fox_news_has_a_conspiracy_theory_for_the_ages_obama_secretly_wants_his_healthcare_law_destroyed/,"Today could very well be the day we get a Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell. Or it might not be. The ruling could come tomorrow, or Monday. Either way, there isn’t much time left before we transition to the next phase of Affordable Care Act’s life, with or without health insurance subsidies in the majority of states. And given that time is short, I wanted to seize this moment to share with you, my beloved reader(s), one of the hottest King v. Burwell takes that has yet been cooked up.

To recap, the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell seize on four words in the text of the Affordable Care Act to argue that the law is written in such a way that the federal government cannot legally dole out health insurance subsidies to residents of states that use the federal insurance marketplace. The legal minds who dreamed up the case contend that Congress intentionally drafted the bill this way in order to effectively coerce the states into setting up their own marketplaces – build your own exchange, or your residents won’t get money to help pay for health insurance. According to this mythology, the administration didn’t anticipate that so many states would refuse this deal, and so it ordered the IRS to dole out the subsidies in direct violation of the law.

Making this argument requires one to ignore everything one knows about the drafting and passage of the ACA, embrace some fantastical leaps of logic, and deny obvious truths in a spirit of deliberate and pernicious bad faith. And conservatives happily embraced this warped history of the ACA because King v. Burwell carries the potential to do real damage to Obamacare.

That brings us to Matt Kibbe, the outgoing CEO of the Tea Party astroturf group FreedomWorks. Kibbe sees something else happening in the administration’s implementation of Obamacare – something far more sinister than the pedestrian illegality that the rest of the conservative movement has convinced itself of. He wrote an Op-Ed for Fox News a couple of days ago confidently predicting that the Supreme Court will rule for the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell and cripple the Affordable Care Act, and Obama wants it that way.

Read, and be scandalized:

Obama is not worried about the Supreme Court ruling against him, he’s banking on it. It gives him an opportunity to blame Republicans for robbing people of their health care. By taking no action, he can point fingers at everyone else for spoiling his vision of government-run health care. It’s the ultimate insider play: pass a broken law in a one-sided, partisan way, lie to people about what the law does, allow the IRS to implement the law illegally, and then, when it all falls apart, fiddle while America burns in the interest of scoring political points. No wonder people hate Washington.

I’m not entirely sure where to start with this, but here goes. I don’t know the president and I haven’t had the opportunity to ask his opinion of the case (though if he’s reading and he wants to sit down for an interview I can probably move some things around). However, I feel pretty confident in asserting that he’d rather the court not blow a giant hole in his legacy-defining healthcare law, even if doing so would provide him with the rare and precious gift of “an opportunity to blame Republicans.” Seems like he’d rather have a functional healthcare law and not put millions of people at risk of losing their insurance. But I only assume that’s the case because I don’t view the president as an absurdly misguided Machiavellian sociopath.

To that point, Kibbe seems to be suffering from the same strain of cognitive dissonance that is afflicting most conservatives and Republicans who are backing the plaintiffs in King. On the one hand, he thinks Obamacare is an obvious failure – a “broken law” that isn’t living up to the promises that attended its passage. On the other hand, he acknowledges that stripping away the subsidies that are at the heart of Obamacare’s success would be disastrous – America will “burn,” he writes, when they’re taken away. And, of course, Kibbe is very much of the opinion that the subsidies should be stripped away by the Supreme Court. He just thinks Obama should shoulder the blame for it instead of the conservatives and Republicans who are actively pushing to achieve that end.

It’s utter gibberish, and I highlight it because it stands out as one of the more extreme examples of the contorted nonsense that conservatives have eagerly espoused as part of the war on Obama’s healthcare reform law. Hopefully by the end of the day, or by the end of next week, we won’t have to deal with this garbage anymore."

As usual, whenever Medicare is invoked in this context, it is imperative to note the mathematical reality that the existing program is currently on an express train to insolvency, according to government accountants. Undaunted, an increasing number of Democrats are determined to take the financially-doomed program for seniors and massively expand it to the entire population. And look, they say, it's popular:

When people are told that Medicare for All would “guarantee health insurance as a right for all Americans,” support shoots up to 71 percent. https://t.co/cVOvakOZpO — Keith Ellison (@keithellison) January 23, 2019



Overall, a majority of Americans (56/42) initially favor ""Medicare for All."" But as I've argued repeatedly, and will continue to argue, this is a disastrous policy. It would (1) uproot well over 150,000,000 Americans from their existing healthcare arrangements, (2) hand much more unaccountable power over to an unresponsive and often incompetent federal bureaucracy, (3) inevitably increase wait times for care through rationing, (4) deeply hamper America's world-leading innovation in the critical field of medical technology, and (5) require truly enormous tax increases on every single American worker and family. How might those, shall we say, ""policy tradeoffs"" sit with voters? Not well:

Survey shows support for 'Medicare for all’ plunges when people are asked if they’d pay higher taxes or put up with treatment delays to get it. https://t.co/DgIKAQYOsG — AP Politics (@AP_Politics) January 23, 2019

The poll found that Americans initially support “Medicare-for-all,” 56 percent to 42 percent. However, those numbers shifted dramatically when people were asked about the potential impact, pro and con. Support increased when people learned “Medicare-for-all” would guarantee health insurance as a right (71 percent) and eliminate premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs (67 percent). But if they were told that a government-run system could lead to delays in getting care or higher taxes, support plunged to 26 percent and 37 percent, respectively. “The issue that will really be fundamental would be the tax issue,” said Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who reviewed the poll. He pointed out that state single-payer efforts in Vermont and Colorado failed because of concerns about the tax increases needed to put them in place.

Democrats inveighed against the GOP-passed tax reform law of 2017 by warning -- falsely -- that it was a tax increase on the middle class, eventually shifting to complain that the middle class tax cuts weren't permanent (before voting en masse against making them permanent). In light of the political anathema that is hiking taxes on the non-""rich,"" let there be no mistake: Single-payer health care would absolutely, positively force tax rates much higher on middle income and working class Americans. Please recall this menu of ugly options to cover the annual (!) $3.2 to $3.8 trillion price tag (for context, the entire federal budget in 2017 was $4 trillion) of ""Medicare for All,"" which would bend the total American healthcare cost curve upward by four-to-six trillion dollars over its first decade alone:

The Mercatus Study -- like others -- shows that ""Medicare for All"" would require a federal tax hike of roughly 10% of GDP even after capturing state govt. savings.



But capturing the savings to families into a ""single-payer tax"" is not easy -- which is why Sanders comes up short pic.twitter.com/Etfjk22sQc — Brian Riedl (@Brian_Riedl) July 30, 2018

Perhaps the most efficient way to achieve that would be to combine the top three revenue generators listed: Raise the payroll tax (paid for by workers and employers) by ten percentage points for everyone, impose a brand new 20 percent national VAT/sales tax, and hike income tax rates across the board by ten percentage points. Not one of those three; all of those three. That is an extraordinary, radical, humongous package of tax increases on virtually all Americans. Please notice that cobbling together a string of more populist ""fair share"" nibblings that tend to poll better would result in woefully insufficient revenues.

If the general concept of tax increases to pay for single-payer drags public support down into the 30's, how would the bruising blend of hikes mentioned above go over with Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer? As for delays in treatment, that consequence is an unavoidable side effect of government-run systems, as we've seen at the VA, and in places like Great Britain (where entire types of surgeries are sometimes postponed nationwide for months, with even more drastic measures being debated), and Canada. Americans would have their existing plans canceled, be given far fewer options, wait longer (already polling at 26 percent) for care, and relinquish decision-making power to a centralized government machine under ""Medicare for All."" And that's even if we somehow had a realistic or palatable way to pay for it, which we don't.

There's a reason why this idea crashed and burned in Colorado, was abandoned in uber-liberal Vermont, and would shatter California's broken budget. The failed state-level experiments are already speaking for themselves -- loudly. I'll leave you with a useful refutation of the deeply misleading statistics that are often invoked to justify demolishing America's world-class healthcare status quo in favor of a government supremacist regime."

Jan 14 2016,Hillary Clinton's absurd Bernie smear: Why attacking him from the right on healthcare makes literally no sense at all,Salon,left,http://www.salon.com/2016/01/14/hillary_clintons_absurd_bernie_smear_why_attacking_him_from_the_right_on_healthcare_makes_literally_no_sense_at_all/,"After years of the right wing trying one scheme after another to take away Obamacare, it jars the senses to watch Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton accuse her primary rival, Bernie Sanders, of wanting to take away Obamacare.

Sanders, she now insists, would do so from the left by instituting a program — single-payer healthcare — that would be more progressive than the Affordable Care Act. Yet this possibility is portrayed in the starkest of terms. It’s as if the Clinton campaign saw a house burning down and told the fire department to put it out by setting the house next door on fire to suck up all the oxygen feeding the flames.

The attack is predicated on a bill that Sanders introduced in the Senate in 2013 that would have set up national single-payer. The bill would have required each state to set up its own single-payer program. A federal board would oversee these state programs and take charge of any that don’t meet whatever requirements it lays out. All federal programs – Medicare, Medicaid, SCHIP – would have been folded into these state-run ones.

In a way, Sanders’ bill was structured a little like Obamacare, with each state having the option of setting up a marketplace exchange to sell insurance plans, and the federal government operating one large exchange for consumers in states that don’t want to run their own. Since it would have moved even further to the left than the ACA, obviously it was dead on arrival in Congress.

What’s particularly weird is Clinton’s specific accusation that Sanders’ single-payer plan would allow states to opt out altogether. As if Bernie Sanders, the self-described national democratic socialist, would design a health insurance plan with a giant sop to conservatives. It is, simply put, divorced from reality.

The Clinton campaign has pressed this attack hard all week, even going so far as to have Chelsea Clinton, who has never been much of an attack dog, go on the trail to slam Sanders for a proposal that would “strip millions and millions and millions of people of their health insurance.” That’s a lot of millions! It also makes Bernie Sanders sound like Mitch McConnell, only with a more grating accent.

It’s a typical Clinton campaign move. Have a bad week at the polls? Overreact with a terrible, transparent attack that anyone with an IQ north of negative can see through. The fact that this move might alienate the Sanders supporters she’ll need later on if she wins the nomination does not seem to enter the calculation.

I’ve been watching liberals grumble about this whole blow-up in my Twitter feed for a couple of days, calling Clinton dishonest and dirty while also acknowledging that there is some value to having this fight now, in the primaries, so as to sharpen the general Democratic healthcare platform before the general election. There have also been suggestions that Sanders and Clinton could unite to push some sort of public option, the fabled unicorn the Obama administration took off the table while writing the ACA back in 2009, thus dooming its progressive credibility for all time in some circles.

Settling on a healthcare goal for the party platform is a worthy goal of this debate, if that’s in fact what’s going on here. But Democrats could all save themselves a fair amount of grief by remembering this truth: No healthcare proposal from Sanders or Clinton, be it a public option or a single-payer system, has any chance in hell of passing through the Congress that the next president will be saddled with.

I know it’s fashionable in some quarters to talk about bringing a political revolution to Washington, but the reality is that the major barrier to enacting single-payer or adding a public option to the ACA remains Congress and the army of industry lobbyists who will descend on it the minute the insurance companies think their bottom lines are in jeopardy. Plus the House of Representatives is likely to stay under Republican control after November, and those Republicans are going to be the same stubborn, jelly-brained nihilists who have turned President Obama’s hair gray over the last seven years.

An even if by some miracle the House flips to the Democrats, a president would still have to contend with the Senate. There is a chance the Democrats could become the majority party there, but it won’t be a 60-member supermajority that marches in ideological lockstep. Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson may be gone, but the chamber has not yet been fumigated of their spirits.

In fact, assuming the next president is a Democrat, his or her main job with regard to healthcare will be keeping Republicans from repealing the Affordable Care Act. Adding to it or fixing some of its flaws will likely have to wait until either we have a more liberal Congress or the Republican Party decides to start governing again. Everything else we’re hearing is just noise.

Of course, maybe President Clinton or President Sanders will surprise us all and pull off a couple of miracles. But considering how insane the election of either is likely to drive the GOP, some pessimism is definitely warranted."

Karen Roses worked at Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead, New York for over three years as a patient care technician. She said the pandemic has been exhausting, leaving medical personnel burnt out and hospitals understaffed. Then came the vaccination mandate.

""They come out with the mandate, and they just basically threw us under the bus,"" Roses, 64, said about healthcare workers. She called the hospital ""callous"" for terminating employees while disregarding how long they had been employed with the hospital or whether they were seeking medical or religious exemptions to the vaccine.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

According to the state mandate that went into effect in August, New York hospital and nursing home healthcare workers were required to have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose by September 27, while home care, hospice, and adult care facility workers have until October 7. Roses was terminated the day after the vaccine deadline.

Roses said unvaccinated healthcare workers are being singled out and blamed for the ongoing pandemic, despite early suggestions that vaccinated people can spread the coronavirus as well. However, a recent study found that COVID-19 vaccines considerably reduce transmission of the virus by anywhere from 36 to 65%, NBC News reported.

In Suffolk County, where Peconic Bay Medical Center is located, 80% of hospital employees are fully vaccinated, according to September 29 data. Statewide, 87% of hospital employees are fully vaccinated. As a result of the mandate, the vaccination rate of hospital employees has doubled compared to the rate of adults in the state.

""It's not just healthcare workers. It's everybody,"" Roses said.

Roses said vaccination mandates — which have rolled out nationally for healthcare facilities and businesses — are ""taking away a freedom of choice"" from the people affected by them. Roses added that she is not anti-vaccine and has taken other vaccines in the past.

""I don't feel safe in my own country anymore, and that's really what I think is my strongest feeling,"" Roses said. ""Now I feel like a target.""

As Insider's Allana Akhtar previously reported, some health systems have blamed unvaccinated healthcare workers for staffing shortages, but the problem with unvaccinated healthcare workers may be overstated.

Roses said she won't get the vaccine because it feels ""rushed"" and ""forced,"" and it doesn't guarantee that she won't get coronavirus or spread it to others. Experts have said the vaccine was developed quickly because countries and organizations heavily invested in its development, which saved time, as Insider's Mary Meisenzahl previously reported.

""God could come down and say to me, 'You must take this vaccine.' And I'd be like, 'Sorry, Charlie,'"" Roses said. ""It's not something that somebody specifically or a specific group has to tell me it's safe. My research has to tell me it's safe. The people that I talk to... I don't know how to really explain that, but I kind of have to see it for myself.""

In her termination letter, which has been shared with Insider, Northwell Health, New York's largest healthcare provider which owns Peconic Bay Medical Center, stated that Roses was warned ""numerous times"" about the requirement for her to be vaccinated or face termination. The letter added that if she received her first dose in the ""near future,"" she would be eligible for reemployment at the hospital.

A spokesperson for Peconic Bay, a Northwell Health facility, told Insider that Northwell has taken ""a rapid, aggressive approach"" in moving towards full vaccination of its employees.

""Regretfully, we have had to exit a few hundred employees, but we are pleased to report that most team members are opting to be vaccinated so as to avoid being terminated,"" Peconic Bay spokesperson Victoria Palacio said, adding that she could not comment on how many employees were terminated from Peconic Bay specifically.

Northwell Health spokesperson Andrea Mineo told Insider that as of September 27, unvaccinated employees were removed from the health system.

""Northwell regrets losing any employee under such circumstances, but as health care professionals and members of the largest health care provider in the state, we understand our unique responsibility to protect the health of our patients and each other,"" Mineo said. ""We owe it to our staff, our patients and the communities we serve to be 100 percent vaccinated against COVID-19."""

Not only is there no such health-care overhaul in the works on Capitol Hill — there are no plans to make such a plan.

Senate Republicans, who were caught off guard by Trump’s rapid shift to focus on health care last week, said the White House would need to make the first move by putting forward its own proposal. But administration officials said nothing firm is in the works.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) — acutely aware of the perils that health care poses for Republicans — does not intend to wade extensively into the issue, senators and aides said, even as Trump has revived his fixation on a campaign promise to eliminate former president Barack Obama’s health-care law.

Nor does Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), whose panel would be central to any such debate. When asked whether the two Senate committees overseeing health-care policy are planning to draft a replacement proposal for the Affordable Care Act, Grassley responded flatly: “No.”

“Obamacare is something that’s not going to be replaced unless the courts would declare it unconstitutional,” Grassley said in an interview. “You won’t know that for a long time.”

The renewed debate over health-care policy was set off by Trump’s abrupt decision last week directing the Justice Department to intervene in a federal-court case seeking to eliminate the ACA in its entirety on constitutional grounds.

Although the outcome of that case is far from certain, the Trump administration’s aggressive move in court sparked panic among many Republicans — and a measure of glee among Democrats — over the prospect of a protracted battle over health insurance for tens of millions of Americans during a presidential election cycle. Most Republicans are particularly wary given that Democrats took control of the House after last year’s midterm elections in part because of their focus on preserving and expanding health-care programs.

Trump’s move also has baffled Republicans who wish he would have remained focused on the end of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections rather than plunging the party into another fight over Obamacare, which the party has tried and failed to eliminate for nearly a decade.

But any plans to ride on the high of Mueller’s findings — which, according to Attorney General William P. Barr, did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia — swiftly ended with a tweet around 1 p.m. last Tuesday as the president began making his way to the Capitol.

That tweet — in which Trump proclaimed “The Republican Party will become ‘The Party of Healthcare!’” — was how McConnell learned the president was interested in taking up the issue again, according to an adviser to the majority leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal GOP interactions.

McConnell had previously wondered why Trump had suddenly invited himself to the weekly Senate GOP policy meeting at the Capitol, the adviser said. But McConnell later learned that Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), out golfing with Trump at his southern Florida resort last weekend, had revived the subject.

Another perplexed GOP senator speculated that the rest of the party will figure out the next steps the next time Graham goes golfing with Trump.

The private pessimism from Republican lawmakers is nonetheless leaving Trump undeterred.

In phone conversations with senators and discussions with White House officials, Trump has made it clear he sees health care as a priority. He announced before traveling to a political rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday that he had tapped a trio of GOP senators with health-care expertise — Sens. John Barrasso (Wyo.), Bill Cassidy (La.) and Rick Scott (Fla.) — to piece together an ACA replacement.

Barrasso, the No. 3 in Senate leadership, has drafted legislation promoting short-term, limited-duration health insurance that has caught the eye of White House officials. Cassidy, who like Barrasso is a physician, was one of the lead authors of GOP health-care legislation in 2017 that would have turned money for Medicaid and ACA subsidies into block grants for states, which could then use the money for any health-care system to their liking.

The president has praised Barrasso to other aides as someone who should be in the conversation, while indicating his interest in the block-grant bill developed by Cassidy and Graham.

Meanwhile, Scott has been focused on a narrower health-care effort targeting the cost of prescription drugs and is close to introducing legislation. He spoke privately on the phone with Trump on Wednesday, when the two men both expressed interest in taking on health care, Scott recalled.

“Look, I’m going to try to get something done,” Scott said. “But I think it accelerates everything if the White House had a plan.”

Indeed, there is little indication any health-care plan will materialize — or advance in Congress.

A senior White House official directly involved in the discussions said there was no specific proposal. McConnell also has no plans to put together a working group of Republican lawmakers to draft a health-care blueprint as he did in 2017, according to one official familiar with party strategy.

Grassley said no hearings are planned on replacing Obamacare in his committee, and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who leads the Senate’s major health panel, said his focus is working on “reducing health-care costs” and emphasized bipartisan efforts to do so.

Although Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a close Trump ally, is working on a health-care plan to present to the president, several GOP officials said they want the president to just drop it.

“We are very eager to see what the White House submits for Congress to consider,” said one senior Republican aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. “Until then, Republicans will focus instead on their legislative agenda and confirming Trump appointments.”

Operatives at the committees charged with electing GOP lawmakers — the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee — have privately warned that the issue is not helping Republicans up for reelection next fall. Brad Parscale, the president’s campaign manager, has told others involved in the 2020 effort that he does not want health care to be the main issue in the race, people familiar with his comments say.

The GOP has been eager to highlight divisions among Democrats over various proposals for a Medicare-for-all type system, which Republicans characterize as a dangerous lurch toward socialism. Instead, they now confront questions about how exactly they would draft an ACA replacement — allowing Democrats to go on the offensive and tout the now-popular nine-year-old law.

About 20 million Americans would lose their health coverage if the law was overturned, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy think tank. Tens of millions more with workplace plans could also be affected, as employers would be allowed to scale back certain medical benefits and people with preexisting conditions buying coverage on their own would no longer be guaranteed access to coverage at no extra cost.

“They’re trying to take away health-care coverage from tens of millions of people, to take away protections for people who have preexisting conditions, to take away protections for 25-year-olds who are on their parents’ insurance policies, to take away protections so that people don’t get cheated by their insurance companies,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) told reporters Friday while campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa. “That’s where the Trump administration is. That’s where their values lie.”

Yet Trump has viewed his new health-care push as a way to correct what he sees as his biggest political vulnerability, aides say. Trump has occasionally brought up the issue as one of his main frustrations as president, according to a senior administration official, and still complains frequently in private that the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) — who died last August — voted against the last Obamacare repeal effort in 2017.

“A lot of the squeamish Republicans will say they campaigned on this, and it’s a losing issue. But in 2018, they basically campaigned without Republicans putting forth an alternative,” said Marc Short, chief of staff to the vice president. “We should welcome a debate about whether more freedom and more choices lowers costs relative to Democrats’ march toward socialism.”"

Oct 17 2023,Israel accused of blasting hospital and school in Gaza as blockade cripples healthcare system,CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/middleeast/israel-gaza-rafah-crossing-week-2-tuesday-intl-hnk/index.html,"CNN —

Palestinian officials say hundreds were killed by a massive blast at a Gaza hospital on Tuesday, as humanitarian concerns mount over Israel’s deprivation of food, fuel and electricity to the enclave’s population.

Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital was sheltering thousands of displaced people when it was bombed Tuesday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said in a statement. Many victims are still under the rubble, it added.

Palestinian officials blamed ongoing Israeli airstrikes for the lethal incident. But the Israel Defense Forces has “categorically” denied any involvement in the hospital attack, blaming instead a “failed rocket launch” by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, a rival Islamist militant group in Gaza.

“We did not strike that, and that the intelligence that we have suggests that it was a failed rocket launch by the Islamic Jihad, and I want to add, categorically, that we do not intentionally strike any sensitive facilities, any sensitive facilities, and definitely not hospitals,” Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN.

Gaza has been under siege by Israel for more than a week, in response to the deadly incursion by Hamas, the Islamist militant group that controls the coastal enclave, home to 2.2 million people. Hospitals meanwhile are struggling to tend to the wounded across the territory, operating with shortages of electricity and water.

Vital humanitarian aid is meanwhile piling up at Gaza’s shuttered border, despite diplomatic efforts to open a corridor from Egypt. The United Nations and other officials have said they need assurance of safe passage for any potential aid convoys.

Amid growing international pressure to address the crisis, US President Joe Biden will travel to Israel on Wednesday, an extraordinary wartime visit that follows intense efforts by Secretary of State Antony Blinken across the Middle East.

Biden was also due to attend a summit scheduled in Amman, the capital of Jordan, with several Arab leaders. However, the summit was canceled in the wake of the hospital blast.

Instead of the planned meeting, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he would travel back to Ramallah for an urgent meeting of the Palestinian leadership.

The Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in the center of Gaza City was sheltering thousands of people who had been forcibly evacuated, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.

Hamas, which controls the enclave, said more than 500 people were killed by the bombing. The Palestinian Health Ministry earlier said preliminary estimates indicate that between 200 to 300 people died in the attack.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed the “barbaric terrorists in Gaza” for “attacking” the hospital on Tuesday.

“Whoever brutally murdered our children is also murdering their children,” he added.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari later told CNN the IDF has communications between militants in Gaza “saying this is an Islamic Jihad event” as well as drone footage showing strike impact on the hospital’s parking lot, but not the hospital itself.

Hagari said the IDF will soon release that footage and audio of the intercepted communications.

As Israeli and Gazan officials blame the other for the hospital tragedy, protests have sprung up in a number of Middle Eastern cities including Amman, where protesters attempted to reach the Israeli embassy.

Hospitals under siege

More than a week of Israeli bombardment has killed at least 3,000 people, including 1,032 girls and 940 boys, and wounded 12,500 in Gaza, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Tuesday. Casualties in Gaza over the past 10 days have now surpassed the number of those killed during the 51-day Gaza-Israel conflict in 2014.

While the IDF has said it does not target hospitals, the UN and Doctors Without Borders say Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities, including hospitals and ambulances.

On Tuesday, Israeli warplanes hit two densely populated refugee camps and an UNRWA school housing displaced people in central Gaza killed at least 18 people and injured scores, Palestinian officials said.

The IDF said that high-level Hamas commander Ayman Nofal was killed in the airstrikes in Gaza on Tuesday.

In the occupied West Bank at least 61 people have been killed, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said on Tuesday. At least 20 humanitarian workers from the UN, the Red Cross and the Red Crescent have been killed in Gaza, the UN said.

Meanwhile, health services within Gaza are on the brink and food and water supplies are running low. Twenty out of 23 hospitals were offering partial services because fuel reserves are “almost totally depleted,” the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) warned on Tuesday.

UN agencies have warned that shops are less than a week away from running out of available food stocks and that that Gaza’s last seawater desalination plant had shut down, bringing the risk of further deaths, dehydration and waterborne diseases.

Hospitals have been receiving dozens of bodies from different areas of south Gaza, the director of Gaza hospitals, Dr. Mohammad Zaqout, told CNN. The toll includes dozens of victims from air strikes in Rafah.

The Palestinian Interior Ministry said Israeli airstrikes had killed at least 49 people in strikes on the southern Gaza cities of Rafah and Khan Younis.

IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN he was “not aware of any strikes specifically in those areas but they could have happened.”

Closed crossing

Urgent calls for help are growing on both sides of the crossing as aid amasses on the Egyptian side of the border.

Blinken on Tuesday said the the United States and Israel “have agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multilateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza.”

But on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing, a miles long convoy of humanitarian assistance awaiting entry into Gaza, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told CNN.

“Until now, there is no safe passage that has been granted” as they do not “have any authorization or clear, secure routes for those convoys to be able to enter safely and without any possibility of their being targeted,” he said.

He added that the crossing was bombed four times in the past few days.

Beyond the border crossing, moving aid to those in need is extremely complex in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly hit UN facilities in the past week.

“We need to have areas where humanitarians can move through safely, where people who are receiving humanitarian aid can receive that aid safely,” UN spokesman Dujarric told CNN in a press briefing Tuesday.

“The last thing you would want to see is creating distribution points where people receive that aid are not safe.”

WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris told CNN the UN health agency had struck an agreement with Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to open the Rafah crossing for aid – but Israel’s strikes rendered the facility unsafe, thereby halting the movement of crucial supplies.

On Tuesday, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the only things that should be entering Gaza “are hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air Force, not an ounce of humanitarian aid” until Hamas releases hostages, he wrote on Telegram.

On the Gaza side, large numbers of evacuees have gathered by the crossing, part of the mass displacement that has seen at least 1 million people flee their homes in the past week alone, according to UNRWA.

One family of five Palestinian-Americans, all US citizens, drove to Rafah on Monday after hearing the borders would be opened but to no avail, said Haifa Kaoud, whose husband Hesham is among the five stuck in Gaza.

Satellite images provided by Maxar Technologies show four 30-foot (9-meter) craters blocking the roadway at the border crossing closest to the Egyptian gate, along with concrete slabs.

Diplomatic efforts have so far failed to ease the conflict. On Monday, the UN Security Council rejected a Russian resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire after it failed to get enough votes.

Several countries including the US, the United Kingdom and France voted against it because the draft did not condemn Hamas for the October 7 attack, which the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said killed at least 1,400 people with scores taken hostage.

This includes French-Israeli woman, Mia Schem, who was shown in the first hostage video released by Hamas. Her mother, Keren Scharf Schem implored world leaders “to bring my baby back home” when speaking to reporters Tuesday.

CNN cannot independently verify where and when the video of Schem, 21, was taken and what condition she is currently in.

Fears of regional conflict

Regional leaders raised concerns of fighting between Israel and Lebanon’s powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah in the north, and Syria, as strikes at the border become a flashpoint for wider conflict.

The IDF said on Tuesday shots were fired towards several locations on the security fence between Israel and Lebanon.

At the same time, Iranian Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, warned if the “atrocities” against Gaza persist, “Muslims and resistance forces could lose patience,” and no-one would be able to prevent their actions.

After Hamas’ incursion on October 7, militants fired shots from Lebanon that were intercepted by Israel, leading to a deadly exchange of fire.

On Friday evening local time an Israeli strike killed Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah who was also from south Lebanon. The assault wounded at least six other reporters.

A CNN video analysis found that the journalists were wearing vest jackets clearly marked as press.

And on Tuesday, Israeli strikes killed at least four people in Alma al-Shaab, in southern Lebanon, the Lebanese Red Cross said.

Two Hezbollah fighters were killed in confrontations on Tuesday, the militant group said. It is unclear whether they are part of the death toll reported by the Red Cross.

CORRECTION: This article on the Gaza hospital blast initially did not clearly attribute claims about Israel’s responsibility to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. Israel later said a “misfired” rocket by militant group Islamic Jihad caused the blast and produced evidence to support its claim. US President Joe Biden said the Israeli position is backed by US intelligence.

Editor’s Note: This piece discusses suicide and suicidal ideation. If you or someone you know is suicidal, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or the Trevor Project at (866) 488-7386.

Texas’ anti-trans healthcare law is already having a “direct, measurable negative effect on children and families,” said Michele Hutchison, chief of pediatric endocrinology at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.

Hutchison, whose career began in Texas, now frequently consults with families who are considering leaving the state to maintain their children’s healthcare.

Senate Bill 14, which prohibits doctors from providing safe, evidence-backed, and often life-saving forms of healthcare to transgender children, takes effect today after a lawsuit by the ACLU of Texas failed to stop it. Last week, a Travis County District Court issued a temporary injunction that blocked implementation of the law, but Attorney General Ken Paxton immediately appealed the case to the Texas Supreme Court, which automatically overrules a lower-court injunction. The Texas Supreme Court has so far refused, without comment, to issue a similar injunction. Five Texas families, with trans kids between the ages of nine and sixteen, are plaintiffs in the suit.

Ash Hall, a policy and advocacy strategist at the ACLU of Texas said the law is unconstitutional and forces medical professionals to violate their code of ethics.

“Doctors are being forced to violate their oath to ‘do no harm’ by not providing medical care … that improves mental health and lowers their risk of suicide,” they told us.

Hutchison said that even the debate around the bill—part of a nationwide, Republican-led attack on abortion rights and healthcare for trans youth—has had dire effects on the mental health of the trans kids she sees.

“I had several patients admitted to ICUs or hospitals for suicide attempts,” Hutchison told the Texas Observer. “It was heartbreaking.”

Her account is consistent with reports finding that thoughts of self-harm are trending up and LGBTQ+ kids. According to a poll from the Trevor Project, which tries to prevent queer suicide, 86 percent of trans and nonbinary youth say political debates about trans people have negatively affected their mental health.

“I had several patients admitted to ICUs or hospitals for suicide attempts.”

Every major advisory board, from the American Medical Association to the American Academy of Pediatrics, has agreed that these forms of medical care are appropriate for young trans people and dramatically improve their mental health. Children begin these forms of treatment with great care, after months of consultations between parents, mental health professionals, and experts like Hutchinson.

Nationwide, the GOP introduced hundreds of bills in 2023 targeting the rights of queer people, especially young folks. Texas is one of 20 states that currently bans or will soon ban certain forms of healthcare for trans kids. Now, with SB 14 going into effect, Hutchison said families are scrambling to find alternatives, often looking to travel out of state for healthcare if they can afford the frequent trips. Since the state has also threatened to use Child Protective Services to investigate parents for providing healthcare to trans kids—a directive from Paxton’s office that’s sent the department into turmoil and is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit—she said she is forced to tell parents to act with caution, even though their children’s lives may be on the line.

“There’s a lot of legal implications for these families to consider,” Hutchinson said. “And I’m not an attorney, so it’s difficult for me to advise them.”

Currently, an injunction won by the ACLU and Lambda Legal last September protects members of the pro-LGBTQ+ nonprofit PFLAG from investigation by Child Protective Services. Those who are not members are not covered by the injunction.

Under the law, a medical provider who is found to be offering one of the banned medical treatments could lose their license. But Hall emphasized that these forms of care are—contrary to misinformation spread by the state’s lawyers—not only scientifically proven to be safe and effective, they are also essentially identical to forms of medical care offered to cisgender (non-trans) young people. For example, puberty blockers, which temporarily halt the advance of adolescence, are commonly prescribed to young cisgender girls undergoing “precocious” puberty. These same drugs also allow trans kids to make more deliberate choices about their bodies as they age into adulthood. According to Hall, this violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Texas Constitution.

“It discriminates against trans adolescents on the basis of sex and violates the rights of healthcare providers by interfering with their licensure and their ability to practice medicine,” Hall said.

Hutchinson, who got her start as an endocrinologist decades ago in Texas, said she recently allowed her license to practice medicine in the Lone Star State to lapse for the first time in order to continue safely providing medical care to patients in New Mexico without complications. She called the situation “strange” and “sad.”

“I can’t even count how many families I know that have ripped up their lives to move to New Mexico so that their children can be taken care of without fear of reprisal,” Hutchinson said."

Oct 03 2023,New nationwide model to improve Alzheimer’s care keeps healthcare professionals optimistic,KOTA,center,https://kotatv.com/2023/10/03/new-nationwide-model-improve-alzheimers-care-keeps-healthcare-professionals-optimistic,"RAPID CITY, S.D. (KOTA) - Alzheimer’s care has been a problem for the state of South Dakota.

But a new nationwide model to improve care for those who need it has healthcare professionals optimistic.

This summer, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced a voluntary guide with the hopes of creating streamlined care for Alzheimer’s patients.

This guide plans to instill better reimbursement models for patients and their caregivers with a proposed 121% increase in reimbursement rates.

South Dakota healthcare professionals and advocates believe this guide has the potential to fix systemic issues and reduce stress for patients and caregivers but want to see it in action.

”Really it needs to be addressing the disparities that we see in health care,” said Senior Health Systems Director for the Alzheimer’s Association Lisa Groon.

“Making sure that we’re eliminating barriers to care, making sure that we’re offering education to both patients, caregivers, and clinicians related to best practices for navigation models of care.”

There are many difficulties that come with getting people with Alzheimer’s the proper care that they need. But it’s important to know that there’s always help.

The Adult Day Center of the Black Hills is one place that offers help. It has a similar goal to this new guide... which is to relieve the stress of patients and their caregivers.

“Caregiving is exhausting, and everyone deserves a mental break, a physical break from it,” said executive director of the Adult Day Center Black Hills Melanie Barclay.

“Caregivers and their loved ones trying to keep them out of long-term care facilities and provide an alternative for home health.”

Earlier this year the South Dakota legislature approved $2 million to expand adult day service programs just like the one in Rapid City.

And with reimbursement rates up 121% it looks as though the patients and caregivers are starting to get the help they need.

Jul 11 2023,HCA Healthcare data breach could affect millions,News 4 Jax,center,https://news4jax.com/tech/2023/07/11/hca-healthcare-data-breach-could-affect-millions,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Millions of people may be affected by a data breach through HCA Healthcare.

There are five HCA facilities in Northeast Florida.

The company believes the data was stolen from an external storage location used to automate email messages.

The information stolen includes patients’ names, city, state and ZIP codes, contact information, date of birth, gender and any appointment information.

Social security, medical information and credit or account numbers were not impacted.

Jay Fowler, Vice President of the Scarlett Group, a local IT firm, said it’s likely that people who’ve had their information compromised will start getting phishing emails.

“There are people who are considering this potentially the largest at least healthcare data breach ever. So, it’s very big. It’s a big deal,” Fowler said.

HCA’s breach did not include critical medical records, payment information like credit card numbers or passwords but that doesn’t mean your personal information isn’t equally as valuable.

“So, you got people who are going to try to buy that information off of the dark web or wherever and then they’re going to try to use that information to get more data about you or get your credit card or get your financial information or pretend to be FedEx or pretend to be the insurance carrier or whoever, right?” Fowler said. “What they’re going to do is just try to compromise your accounts in such a way that they can either get your password, or get your financial information, and then use it against you and potentially even identity theft.”

Fowler recommends HCA patients do 5 things:

Watch for fraudulent emails

Freeze your accounts

Change your passwords

Use multifactor authentication

Monitor HCA’s website for updates on the data breach

“Anytime you have more than two pieces of personal information, you’re at risk,” Fowler said. “Well, that’s like five. So it’s a big deal. It’s likely that that’s what they’re gonna use to try to compromise you further, somehow get your money. That’s all this is about.”

HCA Healthcare is offering credit monitoring and identity protection services, in some cases for their patients. In the meantime, stay vigilant in identifying calls, emails or SMS texts which appear to be spam or fraudulent and don’t open links or attachments sent from untrusted sources.

As many as 11 million people may be affected. HCA has created a website to keep patients updated."
Aug 09 2023,Westside Family Healthcare unveils new mobile health unit,Delaware Business Times,center,https://delawarebusinesstimes.com/news-briefs/westside-family-healthcare-mobile,"DOVER – Westside Family Healthcare unveils a new mobile health unit design that serves agricultural workers in Kent and Sussex counties at a ribbon cutting held by the Central Delaware Chamber of Commerce (CDCC) to celebrate Agricultural Worker Health Center Day.

“While we are thrilled to reveal the mobile health unit’s new design,” says Chris Fraser, the president & CEO of Westside Family Healthcare, said. “We want to use this important moment to emphasize our on-going commitment to the agricultural community and raise awareness to the health needs of the workers that provide so much for Delawareans statewide. We are thankful for this community’s hard work to provide for Delaware, and we plan to continue to expand our services to their community to ensure they have what they need to stay healthy. We are a team-based healthcare provider, and agricultural workers are a part of that team, as they provide the food resources necessary to battle food insecurity and keep our state healthy.”

“Westside’s MSAW program and the mobile health unit provide us with the opportunity to bring healthcare services to a population that would not normally be able to have these services,” Joseph Mitchell, APRN, FNP-C, associate director of Westside’s Migrant Seasonal and Agricultural Workers (MSAW) program, said. “We recognize that migrant seasonal farmworkers experience barriers to transportation that limit their access to vital care. By travelling to these patients, we overcome the barrier of transportation for many workers and their families, offering them a chance to meet with a provider, ask questions, and receive the care they need.”

“The agricultural worker community works hard and provides Delaware with consistent, fresh food resources,” Mitchell said. “It’s important to recognize their efforts towards our community’s health, and make sure they have access to healthcare services they need to stay healthy during and after the growing season.”

According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, Community Health Centers now serve approximately 20% of the total estimated agricultural worker population. Westside is one of about 175 Community Health Centers to receive supplemental funding to service this population and has been a leader in the initiative to provide care to agricultural workers in Delaware.

“I was pleased to join our trusted partner, Westside Family Healthcare, to celebrate National Health Center Week and National Agricultural Worker Health Day,” HHS Acting Region 3 Director Melissa Herd said. “Community health centers play a crucial role in HHS’ efforts to increase access to quality health care. Westside’s new mobile unit design demonstrates their commitment to serving migrant and seasonal agricultural workers in Delaware.”"
Sep 18 2023,"New partnership to help SC seniors access healthcare in rural, underserved areas",Live 5 WCSC,center,https://live5news.com/2023/09/19/new-partnership-help-sc-seniors-access-healthcare-rural-underserved-areas,"COLUMBIA, S.C. (WCSC) - A new partnership could help thousands of seniors across South Carolina access healthcare.

It comes at a time when healthcare leaders say telehealth, which became more popular than ever during the pandemic, is here to stay.

Within about the next decade, a quarter of South Carolina’s population will be 65 and older, according to the state’s Department on Aging.

State leaders are working to ensure those seniors are able to access healthcare, especially in rural and underserved parts of South Carolina.

“To know that our doctors and physicians and the power behind the technology care about every single one of our rural family members, who are in deserts where there are hospitals closing, where doctors’ offices and doctors aren’t there for those family members during those critical times,” Rep. Mark Smith (R – Berkeley) said.

The partnership between the South Carolina Department on Aging and the nonprofit Palmetto Care Connections will put telehealth carts in 18 senior centers and councils on aging across the state.

Using these carts, staff at the centers will be able to assist seniors with telehealth visits with their primary and specialty care doctors without needing to physically be in the doctor’s office.

“It’ll cut down on the risk of being exposed to other illnesses and the travel time it takes to get to other specialists, so we’re very, very excited about this opportunity,” Department on Aging Director Connie Munn said.

These carts have been available since 2021 through a pilot program in Allendale, Bamberg, and Barnwell counties.

Now money from the federal government will allow them to bring this access to 18 offices in 14 new counties across the state: Cherokee, Chesterfield, Dillon, Georgetown, Greenwood, Hampton, Lee, Marion, Marlboro, McCormick, Orangeburg, Oconee, Sumter, and Williamsburg.

Palmetto Care Connections CEO Kathy Schwarting said out of the nearly 150 offices on aging across the state, they selected rural locations with some of South Carolina’s highest health disparities.

Eventually, they want to make these carts available at every office in all 46 counties.

“The ultimate goal is that a senior would be able to do a telehealth visit from home with a device that they have an internet service that they have. So this is sort of like an intermediary until we can get internet in all of the homes,” Schwarting said.

The Department on Aging said most seniors in the state are on Medicare, which it said does a good job covering telehealth visits. When the legislature returns to Columbia at the start of next year, Munn said the department will push to ensure private insurance covers more of these visits as well.

While the money for this expansion came from the federal government, Munn and Schwarting said the state legislature has played a huge role in promoting telehealth and laying the foundation that made Monday’s announcement possible.

Jul 28 2023,"Minnesota, South Dakota companies scrap major healthcare merger",Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/us/minnesota-south-dakota-companies-scrap-major-healthcare-merger,"A merger that would have created one of the largest health service companies in the Upper Midwest has been scrapped.

Minneapolis-based Fairview Health Services and Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based Sanford Health announced Thursday that they would not proceed with the merger they had been discussing since late last year. It would have created a system with more than 50 hospitals and about 78,000 employees.

This is the second time in a decade that the two companies considered a merger but failed to complete it, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

CATHOLIC HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WITHDRAWS FROM MERGER WITH STRUGGLING CONNECTICUT HOSPITAL

The latest attempt drew fierce opposition at the University of Minnesota, which has a partnership with Fairview. The university sold its teaching hospital to Fairview in 1997 and opposed the idea of an out-of-state entity owning the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis. The merged system would have been based in Sioux Falls, South Dakota's largest city.

Statements from the two companies' CEOs stated that without support from stakeholders, it was determined that the merger couldn't move forward.

The companies first considered merging in 2013 but met with strong political opposition.

Minnesota lawmakers this spring gave the state attorney general additional power to scrutinize health care mergers, including the Sanford-Fairview proposal.

The affiliation between Fairview and the University of Minnesota includes financial support from Fairview for the school's academic medicine mission.

Fairview has said the current agreements are not financially sustainable."

Aug 25 2023,Missouri judge denies attempt to block transgender healthcare ban,Missourinet,center,https://missourinet.com/2023/08/25/missouri-judge-denies-attempt-to-block-transgender-healthcare-ban,"A Missouri court has rejected a bid to freeze the state’s pending transgender healthcare ban. That means the proposed restrictions are on tap to go into law Monday.

Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri, Lambda Legal, and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner law firm sued to overturn the law. They argued that the law is discriminatory. They asked that the proposed limits be temporarily blocked while the challenge works its way through the court system.

St. Louis Judge Steven Ohmer ruled today that the groups have not successfully argued why the pending law should temporarily be blocked.

“The science and medical evidence is conflicting and unclear,” he said. “Accordingly, the evidence raises more questions than answers.”

The law would bar Missouri doctors from prescribing or giving cross-sex hormones or puberty-blocking drugs to any person under 18 years old. It would also ban physicians from doing gender transition surgery on minors.

Minors prescribed puberty blockers or hormones before August 28 would be able to continue to receive those drugs.

As for adults, Medicaid would no longer cover treatments for them, and the state will not provide those surgeries to prisoners.

Doctors who violate the law could have their licenses revoked.

The law is set to expire in August 2027.

Aro Royston, Board Secretary for PROMO Missouri, the state’s LGBTQ+ public policy and advocacy organization, said the group is enraged.

“Not only has our government and elected officials failed us, but now our justice system has failed to do its job in protecting the most vulnerable of our population. The courts told the transgender community, parents of gender-expansive youth, and the entire LGBTQ+ community that we do not exist, that we do not have the right to make our own medical decisions or the right to bodily autonomy. There is no categorical ban like this in the world making the actions of the Missouri State Government the most egregious in history,” Royston said in a written statement. “The rationale was that the “science and medical evidence is conflicting and unclear” even though every major medical association in the United States supports gender-affirming healthcare as the standard of care. We also know that youth who do not have access to this life-saving and medically necessary healthcare are at risk for depression and suicide.”

In a court brief, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said that blocking the law would open the gate to interventions that a growing international consensus has said may be “extraordinarily damaging.” He provided a written statement about today’s ruling.

“Missouri is the first state in the nation to successfully defend at the trial court level a law barring child mutilation. I’ve said from day one as Attorney General that I will fight to ensure that Missouri is the safest state in the nation for children. This is a huge step in that direction. What a day,” he said.

The next court hearing in the case is scheduled for September 22.
