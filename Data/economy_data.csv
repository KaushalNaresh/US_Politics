Aug 29 2023,China’s economy is slowing down. What gives?,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/8/29/23845841/chinas-economy-xi-expert,"By now you’ve probably heard, China’s economy is not doing so well.

The country’s once-booming real estate sector is stalled. China has slipped into deflation. Foreign direct investment is down. So are exports. Youth unemployment reached a record high of more than 20 percent in June. And this is just what we know. After all, China has slowly stopped releasing lots of public economic data, making it hard to get a complete picture.

What we do know is that the story of China’s unimpeded economic rise is turning out to be a bit more complicated — and it may have been a long time coming, with or without China’s very strict Covid-19 pandemic policies. All of this could have profound economic, political, and social fallout for Beijing, and the rest of the world.

Before getting there, it’s worth trying to figure out the basics on why China’s economy is struggling right now. To do that, Vox called up Stephen Morgan, a professor emeritus of Chinese economic history at the University of Nottingham, who wrote a book on the Chinese economy.

Basically, China’s economy is out of balance and has been for some time. Investments dominate the country’s economy, far more than consumption — that is, what households are spending. It didn’t matter so much when investment juiced China’s GDP in good times, and indeed, kept China’s economy afloat during the Covid-19 pandemic.

But that investment playbook has been losing its potency. A chunk of investments are unproductive — for example, a shiny new airport is great, but if it sits empty and no one travels through it, that’s not a great return on investment. But whether the airport is busy or a ghost town, it required bonds and loans to build. That produced growth, but it also increased China’s debt, so much so that right now, it’s triple — yep, around 300 percent — the amount of China’s economic output. “That doesn’t really matter until the debt has to be settled. More stimulus simply increases debt and delays the reckoning,” Morgan said.

What that reckoning might look like is hard to answer because the Chinese government and its leader, President Xi Jinping, are not exactly known for transparency. As Morgan sees it, China is dealing with a “slow fizzle.” But how Xi and his government manage that fizzle is far from an easy question for anyone to answer.

Our conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.

Jen Kirby

There’s all this talk about China’s economic slowdown. But I wanted to ask first, broadly, what is, or has been, the “China model”?

Stephen Morgan

The best way to think about what the Chinese model of economic development is is to think of it as an investment-led model. When China began to reengage with the world economy, over 40 years ago now, it suffered from chronic underinvestment: housing, infrastructure, education, services, etc., were very poor.

By about the middle of the 2000s — around 2005, or so — China had actually filled up a fair bit of that. It was about that time that Premier Wen Jiabao urged a shift away from investment to consumption.

As soon as we start to talk about investment and consumption, I think we need to also make clear what we mean in terms of that, and of GDP [gross domestic product]. People tend to think of GDP in terms of output of goods and services. The other way economists think of GDP is: What are the inputs to creating those outputs? The most important inputs to creating growth are, firstly, investment. Secondly, household consumption. Plus government services, and a little bit in terms of net exports. But it’s investment and household consumption that really matters.

From the 1980s right through until the early 2000s, household consumption [in China] was roughly around 48 percent, and so the rest went on investment and government services. But beginning around 2000, just after China joined the World Trade Organization, there was another huge burst of economic growth. Household consumption massively collapsed to reach about only 34 percent in 2010. Investment was nearly 50 percent of GDP. Now, how does that compare to the world average? Well, roughly, the world average for household consumption is about 60 percent. If you’re looking at the United States, it’s around 70 percent.

China is at the other extreme. It got down to 34 percent. At present, it’s still 38 percent. So you’ve got a problem. There’s been an excessive amount of investment, particularly in real estate and infrastructure for the last 15 years. What that has done is massively increased China’s debt level. But it also means the Chinese household just really doesn’t have the share of income to actually spend. So when the Chinese government talks about increasing consumption, in truth, the only way it can increase consumption is to try to transfer assets and cash from companies and the government to the households. That’s the bind that China is in at present.

Jen Kirby

Can you talk a little bit more about this investment?

Stephen Morgan

Investment is largely going into, as I said, infrastructure, real estate. At present, probably about 40 percent of that is unproductive. One way to think of that is “bridges to nowhere.” The thing about investment is it doesn’t matter whether the bridge goes to nowhere or it actually serves a purpose. It produces GDP growth.

When I was living in China, between 2013 and 2020, in Ningbo, I used to take the bus to work every day. The bus stops between my apartment and the university were rebuilt three times — three times in about six years. The first time they needed rebuilding. The second time, there were some nice improvements, like electronic boards that told you when the bus was going to come. The third time they rebuilt all the bus stops with so much steel you would need a tank to knock them down. Other than that, there was very little welfare benefit. That’s wasted investment.

This increase in investment means that local government has to get the money from somewhere. Basically, it gets that through loans and bonds and so on. Debt levels have gone up. They don’t really matter, unless they have to be settled. And that’s the problem. They haven’t been settled. They just keep on being pushed out.

Jen Kirby

The problem now seems to be that China can’t keep relying on that investment playbook. You have all these bills due, you have so much debt, so if you invest more, you make the problem worse, not better. Is that the best way to look at it?

Stephen Morgan

I think you hit it on the head, Jen. The Chinese investment-led model ran out of steam quite a few years ago but it’s been kept going because there’s been a reluctance to try to shift from investment to consumption.

The reason for that is what it will mean. You’ve got to transfer assets and cash from the corporate sector and the government sector to the household. That means that corporations, like big property developments, local governments, and so on, are not going to have the resources they previously had. These big companies, many of them are state-run, and local government, which is state-run, there are lots of vested interests. They don’t want to see that happen.

Could China do it? Well, yes.

Jen Kirby

So is China trying to shift this balance toward consumption and just can’t? Is that the fundamental issue here?

Stephen Morgan

If we think about what’s been happening over the last couple of months, the Chinese economy seems to be — or is — faltering. Growth has been slowing. The hoped-for post-Covid resurgence has not occurred. How has the Chinese government responded? With only rather small and piecemeal policy measures. Lots of people have become, let’s say, disappointed with these lackluster initiatives.

In particular, they have wondered to themselves: “Why hasn’t the Chinese government gone for the usual playbook — stimulus?” That’s what kept the Chinese economy going from the global financial crisis of 2007 through 2009 to the present. They ramped up investment primarily during that period, and basically, they haven’t been able to take it back.

All of these piecemeal changes seem to be aimed at trying to keep everything together, to let the big corporation slowly unwind, in a sense, to what I call to fizzle.

But there’s no evidence that Xi and the party are listening and engaging in imaginative policies to shift resources from corporations and the government sector to the household sector.

That would include, for example, increasing pensions, increasing health insurance, or the gap in health insurance, so that people know if they got sick, they would be able to get treated much more extensively before they would have to start to pay. If you increase health insurance, then people won’t need to save so much, so they’ll spend. If you increase pensions, which are really tiny, then retired people — and remember, women in urban China have to retire at 55, and most males in urban China have to retire at 60 — will have more money to spend.

The other thing would be policies, like what some of the provincial governments did around 2020 to try to keep their regional economies alive during Covid, which was to give coupons to residents that gave them a discount if they spent more than a certain amount of money in restaurants or on food each month. There’s a report that I saw quoted recently that this had a huge multiplier effect. People went out and spent money in restaurants, and that kept more people employed, who in turn spent money, and so on.

But there’s no evidence that the Chinese government will engage in any imaginative change to policy, either direct cash handouts, increased pensions, or increased health benefits. If you get the gist from what Xi says, Xi is very much against it, he reckons people should put up with hardship, it makes them strong.

Jen Kirby

If the current trajectory is unsustainable, though, why is there resistance from corporations and local governments?

Stephen Morgan

For corporates, it is going to reduce their profits. For local government, what it primarily means is they will not be able to grow the local economy in ways that will [show up] in GDP data. If the local officials cannot meet targets for local economic growth, those local officials are not going to get promoted.

China’s forecast GDP for 2023 is 5 percent. When the Chinese government announced that, the local governments knew they had to do something that would generate economic activity in the local area that would get that 5 percent level. The Chinese central government would help to make funds available, either through state banks, through the various credit controls. In turn, those local governments go out and, let’s say, release more land to corporate real estate developers, who then build more houses that aren’t really needed, but still grow the economy and grow the debt level.

Jen Kirby

I’m no economist here, but I’m thinking of what the US did during the pandemic: just give people cash. Why can’t China do the same — say here’s some money, go out and spend it — to help boost consumption, if that’s what it needs to do?

Stephen Morgan

Going back to what I said before, it’s about the imagination of the Chinese government and the party. In a sense, it’s about the psyche of Xi. Xi is of the view that the problem is young people and others don’t want to work hard enough. It’s very much like a strong right-wing aversion, that we find in Western economies, to giving handouts to the poor: If they worked harder they wouldn’t be that in that situation. That’s the sort of view that informs Xi.

Then Xi also has the sort of leftist view of not trusting entrepreneurs and innovators. Both of these tensions are coming together to strangle the capabilities of the Chinese economy to grow.

Jen Kirby

So how does China unravel this, especially if it seems somewhat linked to Xi himself?

Stephen Morgan

One of the things that the [Chinese Communist] Party and government needs to try to do is to effect some sort of change in shifting from an investment-led model to a consumption model, without blowing up the economy and blowing up the party.

The political dynamic here is about enabling households to obtain a bigger share of the overall economic pie while also permitting corporations not to collapse, and also ensure that local government does not collapse. Because either of those would generate social unrest.

If local government starts to fall apart, then local services will fall apart. If all these real estate companies start collapsing — and particularly people who have paid for their apartment but have not yet received it — they are going to be very unhappy. If the real estate companies go into a fire sale, property prices will fall even further. Lots of people who own property aren’t going to be very happy. That’s a huge risk for the party and the state at all levels from local government, through provincial government, to the central government. Managing that is extremely difficult, and I really have no sense, to put it bluntly, what might actually transpire.

We might think because they’ve got a lot of security services that they are very solid. But one of the things about authoritarian regimes — even ones that have huge security structures, such as China — is that these end up being quite fragile, and you very quickly get stuff unraveling.

Jen Kirby

All of this makes it seem like fixing this could have unpredictable consequences, but so could just letting things stay as they are.

Stephen Morgan

The thing for us is that the Chinese economy now is really big. It’s the second largest in the world. If it completely unravels, it’s going to have huge consequences, not just for China, but for the rest of the world. There are many, many big corporations in the US, Western Europe, and elsewhere, that are heavily committed and tied to China. Chinese consumers and Chinese companies will stop buying services and products. You’re going to have this global contraction that will occur.

On top of that is the potential for disturbances. A China that becomes chaotic internally could end up being a much more dangerous China for the rest of the world than one that’s just fizzling along like it is now.

Jen Kirby

Well, I guess that’s the question then: Will it stay on a fizzle? How do you see the path the Chinese economy is on right now?

Stephen Morgan

My view for almost a decade has been that there’s no way the Chinese economy will overtake the US. I think that’s become much more clear now.

It’s a big economy. It’s used up all its potential to simply keep on doing what it had been doing previously, and growing. It’s going to be an economy that will be growing much, much more slowly, assuming that the Chinese state and party are able to stop a major crisis emerging in terms of a big recession, or financial crisis, with indebted property developers, indebted local government collapsing. I think at the end of the day, Xi and the party will do their utmost to try to stop that.

Nevertheless, economic growth will slow to around 2 to 3 percent, at best. In the context of how the American economy most recently has been doing, this is pretty amazing. The gap between China and America is actually widening at present, rather than contracting. What we’re going to see is China going along a path where it does succeed with its investments in education, in some productive areas of technology, in innovating, and continuing to grow, but nowhere near the speed it has previously grown, and nowhere near the speed that will be necessary for it to massively close the gap between China and the US.

Jen Kirby

This is a bit of an oversimplification, but there seemed to be a pact between the Chinese government and the people that, as long the economy was growing, people’s lives were improving and comfortable, then they would accept some of China’s less than democratic policies, like surveillance and censorship, for example. Will China’s slow fizzle alter this and have some political and social consequences?

Stephen Morgan

The short answer is yes. Exactly what would it look like will depend on how that slowdown occurs.

Since about 1989, and the Tiananmen Square protests, there has been a basic social contract between the citizens of China and the party. The party will try to ensure good management of the economy and your and your family’s ability to share in the growth that occurs, as long as you stay off the streets and don’t engage in politics. We will protect you. We will ensure you have your wealth and you can continue to produce wealth.

Xi has changed that. The most clear example of that was the way he turned on tech entrepreneurs in 2020. Sure, there was a lot of excess, there was a lot of monopoly and anti-competitive behavior. But these big private-sector firms had been very innovative and major drivers of economic growth.

Similarly, during Covid, we see increasingly tighter controls and zero-Covid measures, where even a single illness in your neighborhood led to complete shutdown — that hit everyone. That hit your livelihood, that hit your family. We had reports of men and women not able to stand the isolation, jumping off their apartment buildings. That undermined that social contract, and I think that was very much behind the sort of protests that we saw last October and November, which then finally led to the lifting of controls.

There will need to be some sort of refashioning of that social contract. I’m not sure that Xi is the leader who can or is willing to do that because that would involve relinquishing authority. It would involve reopening Chinese society to greater dialogue and diversity of views instead of simply toeing the line.

Jen Kirby

There’s a pretty sturdy bipartisan consensus in Washington that China is a threat, and the Biden administration has pursued “decoupling” — reducing dependence on Chinese technology, for example, and also trying to cut China off from key tech, like semiconductors. The US is getting our allies to go along with it. But if China’s economy implodes, it seems like it would be bad for everyone, so I wonder: how do you think the US and its partners should approach China right now?

Stephen Morgan

It’s a bit like asking, “How long is a piece of string?” I would reply, “How long do you want it?”

But seriously, I think I’d begin by saying that I personally think decoupling is neither feasible nor desirable. That does not mean we should not engage in development of policies and measures that protect economies — and our way of life, for that matter — from some of the potentially adverse outcomes from China. That’s very much about de-risking, about how do you continue to collaborate with China, but yet do it in a way that ensures you don’t endanger your own national security, you don’t endanger your own economy?

The difficulty is, not only is China a much bigger economy now, but in many areas, China now has capabilities that are actually beneficial or useful for America, for the West. In some technologies, or aspects of technologies, it might even be more advanced.

The manufacturing process technology of China is better than just about anywhere else in the world. It’s not like that because China invented it, but because China learned how to do it so well, through all the investment that came with post-WTO introduction of Western supply chains into China.

We in the West — whether the US, UK, Europe, Australia, whatever — we need to engage with China still, so that we can share in that. But also we need to be able to protect ourselves from the Chinese capturing, let’s say, trade secrets or innovations that could be turned back. That’s going to be difficult.

At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter whether the US is collaborating with the UK or Australia. There’s going to be a tension and there’s going to be a risk that one company in one country is going to discover what another has and run off with it. That’s the way the business has always gone. Let’s face it, the United States of America wouldn’t have had its Industrial Revolution if it hadn’t been so successful in stealing lots of British technology and railways and textiles in the 1880s, which it did very successfully.

Jen Kirby

If you’ll indulge me one more: Who do you think gives first, Xi or the Chinese economy?

Stephen Morgan

I’ve got no idea."

Dec 13 2023,Federal Reserve holds interest rate steady and predicts 3 rate cuts next year as economy slows,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/12/13/federal-reserve-holds-interest-rate-steady-and-predicts-3-rate-cuts-next-year-as-economy-slows,"The Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday for a third straight time, a sign that it is likely done raising rates after having imposed the fastest string of increases in four decades to fight painfully high inflation.

The Fed’s policymakers also signaled that they expect to make three quarter-point cuts to their benchmark interest rate next year, fewer than the five envisioned by financial markets and some economists. The relatively few number of rate cuts forecast for 2024 — which may not begin until the second half of the year — suggest that the officials think high borrowing rates will still be needed for most of next year to further slow spending and inflation.

Still, in a statement it issued after its 19-member policy committee met Wednesday, the Fed said that “inflation has eased over the past year, but remains elevated.” It was the first time since inflation first spiked that the Fed has formally acknowledged progress in its fight against accelerating prices.

The Fed also provided a hint that its rate cut efforts may be over, saying it is now considering whether “any additional” hikes are needed.

The Fed kept its benchmark rate at about 5.4%, its highest level in 22 years, a rate that has led to much higher costs for mortgages, auto loans, business borrowing and many other forms of credit. Higher mortgage rates have sharply reduced home sales. Spending on appliances and other expensive goods that people often buy on credit has also declined.

So far, the Fed has achieved what few observers had thought possible a year ago: Inflation has tumbled without an accompanying surge in unemployment or a recession, which typically coincide with a central bank’s efforts to cool the economy and curb inflation. Though inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has declined faster than Fed officials had expected, allowing them to keep rates unchanged and wait to see if price increases continue to ease.

At the same time, the government’s latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation in some areas, particularly health care, apartment rents, restaurant meals and other services, remains persistently high, one reason why Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reluctant to signal that policymakers are prepared to cut rates anytime soon.

On Wednesday, the Fed’s quarterly economic projections showed that its officials envision a “soft landing” for the economy, in which inflation would continue its decline toward the central bank’s 2% target without causing a steep downturn. The forecasts showed that the policymakers expect to cut their benchmark rate to 4.6% by the end of 2024 — three quarter-point reductions from its current level.

The Fed is the first of several major central banks to meet this week, with others also expected to keep their rates on hold. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will decide on their next moves Thursday."

Goldman Sachs predicts the global economy will top expectations in 2024, driven by strong income growth and confidence that the worst of rate hikes is already over. The investment bank forecasts the world economy to expand 2.6% next year on an annual average basis, above the 2.1% consensus forecast of economists polled by Bloomberg. The U.S. is expected to outpace other developed markets again with estimated growth of 2.1%, Goldman said. Goldman also believes that the bulk of the drag from monetary and fiscal tightening policies is over. To curtail rising inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve started its aggressive rate hike campaign in March 2022 as inflation climbed to its highest levels in 40 years. Last Thursday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he is ""not confident"" the Fed has done enough to tackle inflation, and suggested that more rate hikes may be necessary.

Goldman said policymakers in developed markets are unlikely to cut interest rates before the second half of 2024 unless economic growth comes in weaker than estimated. The bank noted inflation has also continued to cool across G10 and emerging market economies, and is expected to ease further. ""Our economists forecast this year's decline in inflation to continue in 2024: sequential core inflation is predicted to fall from 3% now to an average 2-2.5% range across the G10 (excluding Japan),"" the report stated.

Global factory activity

The investment bank also expects global factory activity to recover from a recent slump as headwinds are set to dissipate this year. Goldman noted global manufacturing activity has been weighed down by a weaker-than-expected rebound in Chinese manufacturing and the European energy crisis, as well as an inventory cycle that had to correct for overbuilding last year.

We continue to see only limited recession risk and reaffirm our 15% U.S. recession probability. Jan Hatzius Chief Economist at Goldman Sachs

Global production has been in a slump for most of the year. S&P Global's gauge of worldwide manufacturing activity came in at 49.1 in September. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction in activity. Additionally, China's Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5 in October from 50.6 in September, marking the first contraction since July. Manufacturing activity should recover somewhat in 2024 from a subdued 2023 pace, Goldman economists led by chief economist Jan Hatzius said, especially as ""spending patterns normalize, gas-intensive European production finds a trough, and inventories-to-GDP ratios stabilize.""

Big economies to avoid recession"
Nov 14 2023,China will aim to humiliate Biden. Xi's economy is in tatters and he needs a win,Fox News (Opinion),right,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-aim-humiliate-biden-xis-economy-in-tatters-needs-win,"NEW You can now listen to Fox News articles!

Former President Donald Trump said it best: ""We have a guy in the White House who can’t put two sentences together, who couldn’t find his way off this stage. And this is the guy we have negotiating with….President Xi of China.""

Biden’s mental impairment is one reason to dread his upcoming meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in San Francisco. Another is mounting evidence that the president is compromised. If indeed the president and his family took in millions of dollars from government-affiliated entities in China, as it appears they did, we can be certain the details of those transactions are known to Xi and can be used to ""persuade"" Biden to adopt the party line --- the Communist Party line, that is.

At the least, Biden will most likely avoid challenging Xi on the critical role Beijing plays in poisoning tens of thousands of Americans each year with fentanyl or their support for Iran-backed Hamas.

BIDEN’S FAILED FOREIGN POLICY WITH CHINA IS BASED ON A DISASTROUS IDEA

Rather than hammer China’s president over his financing of Putin’s war crimes in Ukraine, his lies about the Wuhan virus, or the planned spy base in Cuba, Biden will stick to safe turf, like begging Xi to expand his country’s commitment to climate change. Xi will respond with platitudes, and then go about building coal-fired power plants at a feverish pace. In return, Biden will commit the U.S. to even more damaging regulations of our own carbon emissions.

Biden cannot afford to ruffle Xi’s notoriously delicate feathers. Instead, the entire summit will serve Xi’s need to demonstrate he is more powerful than Joe Biden. Once again, the U.S. president and his team will ignore this reality: China is in trouble, and they need us more than we need them.

How do we know how the conversations will go? Because that was the script when the two leaders last met, in Bali a year ago. The readout of that meeting from the White House highlighted Biden’s push for cooperation on climate change, as did the readout from the Chinese side.

To be fair, Biden did emphasize that the U.S. ""opposes any unilateral changes to the status quo"" regarding Taiwan. But he approached other hot topics obliquely, mildly criticizing, for example, Beijing’s ""non-market economic practices"" and raising ""Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine and Russia’s irresponsible threats of nuclear use.""

""Non-market economic practices?"" Like stealing critical patents, cyber-hacking and trampling the rules of international trade?

The humiliation this time around has already begun, with Beijing keeping the White House on tenterhooks for weeks about whether the encounter will even take place. As innumerable U.S. officials pressed for the summit, Biden looked desperate, which is, of course, exactly what the Chinese want.

Xi needs to look victorious in his relationship with the U.S. The dictator has brutally taken control of China’s economy, and it is not going well. Fearing an emerging and powerful business class who might threaten his dominance, Xi cracked down on tech entrepreneurs and other wealthy Chinese, roiling their confidence. He also orchestrated a devastating shut-down during COVID, which alarmed his citizens. Consumer spending has yet to recover.

China’s growth has slowed dramatically, exports are falling and foreign firms are fleeing the country, for the first time in modern history. In the second quarter, direct investment by foreign companies into China plummeted 87% compared to the year before, the largest drop since 1998.

Last year, household wealth fell in China for the first time in two decades. Youth unemployment is at record highs and consumer sentiment is in the gutter. Moreover, China’s problems will be compounded in coming years by the approach of a demographic cliff. The population, thanks to the long-time one-child policy, is already in decline.

Xi also delivered a critical blow against his country’s property development industry, which had fueled growth for decades and grown to some 30% of the economy. In 2021, Xi proclaimed ""housing is for living in and not for speculation"" and turned a real estate boom into a bust. Now the government is pulling out all stops to revive the deflating sector.

Xi needs a win, and one-upping President Biden will suffice.

It will start – guaranteed -- with the visuals. Video of the Bali encounter shows Xi walking a few steps to the center of the marble-floored reception area while Biden sets off from the distant wings at a trot, eager to join the most despotic ruler since Mao. He then walks hastily towards his counterpart, grinning broadly and hand outstretched; Xi greets the U.S. president with a cursory smile and then snatches his hand away.

The impression? Joe Biden is needy and Xi is in control.

The White House has set expectations low for the meeting in San Francisco, telling reporters, ""We’re not talking about a long list of outcomes or deliverables."" One thing Biden will seek is to reopen military-to-military communications, deemed essential in light of the 180-plus times that Chinese aircraft have interfered with U.S. planes since late 2021, more than the number recorded for the entire preceding decade. That was the goal of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s trip to Beijing in June, but he was rebuffed.

The White House wants to appear ""tough"" on Beijing by, for instance, adopting various measures designed to lessen our reliance on China. Last year, Biden imposed a ban on exports of key semiconductor chips essential to producing military goods and to AI. By design or otherwise, those restrictions have quickly been rendered impotent as Nvidia found a way to design around the curbs.

That is Joe Biden’s White House in a nutshell. Uncertain, timid and ineffectual, just like the president.

Argentina's Javier Milei, a far-right political outsider often compared to former U.S. President Donald Trump, vowed to deliver on his radical economic policies shortly after winning the country's presidential runoff.

Milei, whose term will run from Dec. 10 through to the end of 2027, staged a resounding win in Sunday's vote by a wider-than-expected margin.

He received roughly 56% of the vote, according to provisional results, comfortably beating Peronist Economy Minister Sergio Massa, who conceded after receiving just over 44%.

The shock result leaves Latin America's third-largest economy in uncharted territory.

Proud libertarian Milei, 53, has previously described himself as an ""anarcho capitalist"" and at one point on the campaign trail even wielded a chainsaw to symbolize his intent to cut state spending.

Among some of his proposed policies, Milei has pledged to dollarize the economy, abolish the country's central bank and privatize the pension system.

""We have the determination to put the fiscal accounts in check. We have the determination to fix the problems of the central bank. We have the determination to put Argentina on its feet and move forward,"" Milei said shortly after his victory, according to a translation.

""Today, we return to the path that made this country great,"" he added.

The challenges facing Milei's presidency are significant, however — particularly given that the country is once again in the grip of a profound economic crisis.

The purchasing power of the South American nation has been ravaged by an annual inflation rate of more than 140%, while 2 in 5 Argentines now live in poverty and key agricultural areas have been hit by a historic drought."

Outdoor recreation has a new tagline: a trillion-dollar industry.

The new measurement of the outdoor recreation economy by the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows outdoor businesses in 2022 earning $563.7 billion, accounting for 2.2% of the nation’s gross domestic product and employing 5 million workers.

Spending on outdoor recreation — defined by the bureau as gross output — reached $1.1 trillion, a 19% jump from 2021.

This is the sixth year the federal government has analyzed outdoor recreation. And the numbers continue to reveal an economic juggernaut that drives urban and rural communities across the country. Outdoor recreation now is bigger than the country’s mining, agriculture and technology industries.

The new easy-to-trumpet trillion-dollar impact arrives as federal lawmakers weigh the America’s Outdoor Recreation Act of 2023, a package of legislation that would, among, many things, champion recreation in federal land management plans, encourage private partnerships on federal campgrounds, support outdoor businesses and help rural communities manage the impacts of recreation.

The legislation, sponsored by Democrats and Republicans, has passed out of the U.S. Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is expected to be heard by a U.S. House committee soon.

“These numbers help us make the case for outdoor recreation priorities,” said Chris Perkins, the vice president of programs for the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, a coalition representing 110,000 outdoor businesses, nonprofits and associations. “This gives the industry a seat at the table supporting the most comprehensive package of outdoor recreation bills in a generation.”

The Bureau of Economic Analysis measures the industry in three categories: “conventional” outdoor recreation, “other” outdoor recreation and “supporting” industries. The conventional category includes cycling, paddling, fishing, climbing, hunting, motorized recreation, RVing and skiing. Other recreation categories include going to amusement parks, concerts and sporting events, playing field sports, taking guided tours and gardening. Supporting industries include construction and travel.

Using the BEA yardstick, travel is the largest contributor to the outdoor recreation economy, accounting for more than $339 million — or roughly 40% — of the outdoor economy. The industries supporting outdoor recreation are up 28% compared with 2021, while the economic activity in the core outdoor recreation categories is up 12%.

But since 2018, when the bureau first began studying the outdoor economy, the economic impact of core activities are up 36%.

That’s understandable considering the spectacular growth and appeal of outdoor recreation in 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic pushed more people outside. Now, as other industries, like travel, rebound from the pandemic downturn, it’s understandable to see stronger growth in those peripheral, supporting economies, Perkins said.

Kent Ebersole, the head of the Boulder-based Outdoor Industries Association, said the $1.1 trillion mark “proves that the outdoor recreation industry is an economic force.” He said his group was “especially proud” to see the growth in core activities since 2019, with more than 55% of Americans getting outside for recreation.

The BEA is still compiling specific state data, but Colorado ranks sixth among states with the fastest growing outdoor recreation economies. Outdoor recreation employment in Colorado rose 9.2% in 2022, compared with a national average of 7.4%.

A big part of the 2022 growth in Colorado can be credited to snowsports. Nationally, the economic impact of all snow activity — skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling and other winter sports — grew 39%, with spending reaching $13.2 billion. Skiing and snowboarding accounted for $7 billion of that. Colorado contributed $1.4 billion to that winter sports impact, more than twice any other state.

That jibes with ski industry numbers showing both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 ski seasons as the busiest ever for the nation’s resorts. And Colorado ski areas reported highs of 14 million visits in 2021-22 and 14.8 million in 2022-23. Colorado typically accounts for 20% to 25% of the nation’s ski resort business.

Luis Benitez, the first director of Colorado’s outdoor recreation office who now works as the chief impact officer at the Trust for Public Lands said the trillion-dollar mark should sway the federal government to form a federal office of recreation.

“Name another trillion-dollar economy that does not have a deep, well-constructed overwatch,” he said. “The time is now.”

The new federal office inside the Department of Commerce would direct the Biden Administration’s revived Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation. It would support natural resource protection. It would wade into public health and trade policies and promote higher education programs to better hone industry leaders, Benitez said.

As the race for the 2024 presidency begins, Benitez wants to see all candidates discussing how they will support and protect the nation’s newest trillion-dollar industry.

“The ’t’ really shifts the conversation,” he said. “The ’t’ changes things.”"

A record number of subprime borrowers are behind on their auto loan payments by 60 days or more, according to figures from Fitch Ratings reported by Bloomberg.

The rate hit 6.11% in September – the highest since records began in 1994, and was up from the 5.93% recorded at the start of the year.

Analysts predict that auto loan delinquencies will continue to rise into 2024 and peak at about 10% before they start to fall, per CNN.

Nov 03 2023,"The US economy added 150,000 jobs in October, lower than expected",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/03/economy/jobs-report-october-final/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN —

For several months now, the US labor market has been on a cooling trajectory, and Friday’s jobs report made that even more apparent.

The US economy added 150,000 jobs last month, falling below expectations but still notching a solid month of employment growth, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.

October’s job growth came in below September’s stronger-than expected but downwardly revised total of 297,000 jobs.

“After the hot September, air conditioning has been turned on in October,” said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of SS Economics and a professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University.

The unemployment rate ticked higher to 3.9%, its highest level since January 2022.

Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 3.8%, according to Refinitiv.

Last month’s job gains are the lowest since June, but there is a caveat: The October total reflects a 35,000-job decline in the manufacturing sector, specifically 33,200 jobs lost in the motor vehicles and parts industry. Those declines were largely attributed to strike activity.

The United Auto Workers union went on strike in mid-September against Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. At the end of October, the UAW reached tentative agreements with the Big Three automakers to end the labor strikes.

What this means for the Fed

The resiliency of the labor market has helped to keep consumer spending strong and the economy churning, but Federal Reserve officials are hoping for more of a slowdown in order to help rein in inflation.

“The October jobs report provides plenty of evidence that labor market conditions are softening and will allow the Fed to keep policy on hold as it monitors its progress toward returning inflation to 2%,” Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist for Oxford Economics, wrote in a note Friday.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday in a news conference that the labor market has been moving into “better balance,” but that it’s likely there still needs to be slower growth on the jobs front to fully achieve price stability.

Job growth has slowed tremendously from its breakneck pace in 2021 and 2022, when monthly gains averaged 605,000 and nearly 400,000, respectively. Including the estimated 150,000 jobs added last month and the downward revisions to August and September that totaled 101,000 jobs, the United States is averaging 239,000 jobs gained per month so far this year.

Fed officials are closely watching wage growth. In October, average hourly earnings ticked up by 0.2%, a slightly slower pace than the month before. On an annual basis, that measurement of pay growth is up 4.1%, the slowest growth seen since the middle of 2021.

Where the jobs were — and weren’t

Because of the timing of the striking actions and how the BLS tracks such activity, October is the first jobs report that reflects the massive strike.

In October, the BLS tabulated that there were 48,100 workers on strike. That’s the highest monthly since February 2004, when 72,000 Southern California grocery workers went on strike.

“With the strike now settled, employment in the industry should bounce back in November,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist with PNC Financial Services.

Aside from the significant — but likely temporary — losses registered in manufacturing, many industries recorded job gains last month, albeit at a more moderate pace.

The health care and social assistance industry accounted for nearly half of the month’s gains by adding 77,200 jobs last month. Government, led by local government and school, added 51,000 jobs.

Leisure and hospitality, which has been on a tear of hiring as of late, added a relatively muted 19,000 positions in October, versus a gain of nearly 80,000 jobs the month before, according to BLS data, which is adjusted for seasonal factors.

Unemployment edges higher

The monthly jobs report is composed of two surveys: One that surveys businesses about employment, hours and earnings; and the other that surveys households about their status in the labor force.

If there were a point of concern in Friday’s report, it’s coming from the latter survey, said Dante DeAntonio, senior director at Moody’s Analytics.

“The unemployment rate edged higher to 3.9%, which itself is not concerning given our expectation for ongoing softening,” he wrote in commentary issued Friday. “However, the reason for the uptick is more problematic: labor force participation backtracked for the first time since April, and employment as reported by the household survey swung significantly negative.”

Layoff activity has moderated in recent months; however, the latest jobless claims data that was released Thursday showed a steady rise in continuing claims, which are those filed by people who have received unemployment benefits for more than one week.

Such an increase potentially signals that laid-off workers are having more difficulty finding new jobs.

In Friday’s jobs report, the share of unemployed workers who have been out of a job for 15 weeks or more increased to 36.5% from 35.8%.

“The clearest path toward a soft landing in the labor market is for growth in labor supply to hold steady as job gains slow, allowing the unemployment rate to ease slightly higher,” DeAntonio wrote.

A ‘solid and, yet, cooling’ trend

A monthly payroll gain of 150,000 jobs is absolutely cooler in the context of the past three years; but historically, it’s nothing to balk at.

“It’s still a robust market,” Ger Doyle, a senior vice president with ManpowerGroup, told CNN. “Overall, it’s stabilization coming back into the market. So it’s solid and, yet, cooling.”

It also remains well above the neutral rate of 70,000 to 100,000 jobs needed monthly to keep up with population growth.

In the decade before the pandemic — a period that, coincidentally, included the longest-ever stretch of labor market expansion — job growth averaged 183,000 per month.

October’s payroll gains bring this current streak to 34 months, which is the fifth-longest of job growth on record, BLS data shows.

And considering that there are about 1.5 open jobs for every unemployed person, there’s still plenty of room for this more sustainable growth to continue, Amy Glaser, senior vice president at staffing firm Adecco, told CNN.

“So we’ve seen, over the last couple of years, massive wage hikes and employees jumping from one employer to another for very large wage increases,” she said. “We’re starting to see that subside a little bit, so, good news for employers on that front. And good news for job seekers, there’s still plenty of opportunities out there.”

She added: “Right now we’re in a really well-balanced moment.”"

Nov 13 2023,Seventy percent of voters believe Biden has hurt economy or left it unchanged: Poll,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/70-percent-voters-biden-hurt-economy-unchanged-poll,"

President Joe Biden’s economic agenda is a major factor amid growing concern in the Democratic Party that the president’s reelection bid is in trouble.

According to a new poll from the Financial Times and the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, 70% of voters think Biden’s economic plans have hurt America’s economy or had no impact on it. Thirty-three percent of voters say Bidenomics has “hurt the economy a lot,” while only 26% believe his policies have helped.

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SMITHSONIAN GIANT PANDA EXHIBIT FOLLOWING BEARS’ DEPARTURE?

Voters’ outlook for the economy has dropped as worries about rising prices and inflation plague Biden’s reelection campaign. The top concerns transcend party lines, as Democrats, Republicans, and independents are all uneasy about price increases. Eighty-two percent of respondents say price increases are their No. 1 financial stress, and three-quarters of them feel it will be the largest threat to the economy in the next six months.

While inflation has fallen since mid-2022 under Biden’s term, following a 40-year high in June 2022, voters are taking precautions with high consumer prices.

The survey reports that 65% of voters said they have cut back on nonessential spending, while 52% of respondents said they have lowered spending on food or other daily necessities.

This summer, Biden’s campaign revamped his economic message, labeling his administration’s successes as part of Bidenomics. As the White House approaches 2024, Biden is trying to convince skeptical voters to favor his economic policies, touring the nation and touting the strong job market and cooling inflation.

Only 36% of voters said they approved of Biden’s handling of the economy, compared to 61% who disapprove.

Growth will dip to less than half a percent in the final quarter of this year, delivering an annual rate of growth in Gross Domestic Product of less than 1%, CBO said.

Things will pick up next year but growth will still come in at just 1.5%, before topping 2% in 2025.

On the jobs front the news is also grim.

“Labor market conditions are expected to slacken in the second half of 2023,” CBO said.

The jobless rate, which has been enjoying record lows as the pandemic eased, will rise from 3.6% now to 4.1% by the end of this year and 4.7% at the end of 2024.

By the middle of next year the economy will be losing 18,000 jobs a month.

Things will improve in 2025, as growth returns.

But in the meantime, the slipping economy will help to tame inflation. The price index for personal consumption expenditures will be 3.3% this year, falling to 2.6% next year.

CBO’s projections suggest the country will avoid a recession, which had seemed a near-certainty to prognosticators late last year, but will still see a significant slowing as real GDP growth goes from 1.4% in the just-completed second quarter to 0.6% this quarter and 0.3% in the final quarter this year.

The growth is powered by a slowdown in consumer spending, as high interest rates and rising unemployment “cause consumers to pull back” this year.

“Consumers have drawn from their stockpiles of savings in 2022 and 2023 to support their spending. But rising delinquency rates on credit cards and consumer loans suggest that some earners have exhausted their savings and will have less wherewithal to maintain spending in the face of elevated interest rates and unemployment,” the CBO said.

The CBO’s projections come as President Biden is arguing voters should give him credit for “Bidenomics,” saying he’s helped the country reach continued growth and spectacular job numbers and Americans “are beginning to feel the effects.”

Republicans counter that he’s responsible for “Bidenflation,” which they say has swamped any increase in wages for most families.

Oct 18 2023,"Biden’s march to energy subservience threatens our economy, national security",Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/oct/17/bidens-march-to-energy-subservience-threatens-our-/,"OPINION:

In just 1,000 days, Green New Dealer in Chief Joe Biden has turned America’s strategic energy dominance into a strategic energy subservience that now gravely threatens our economic and national security. We now run the risk of prolonged stagflation and being drawn into wars in Ukraine, Israel, Iran and the Taiwan Strait.

When I was a doctoral student in economics at Harvard University in the 1970s focused on reducing America’s dangerous oil import dependence, I never dreamed of that day that would come during my service in the Trump White House.

During President Donald Trump’s tenure, the United States became the world’s largest petroleum producer and a net exporter. As a result, America became the de facto policeman of the OPEC oil cartel and world price setter. If OPEC tried to gouge us by restricting supply, the U.S. could further increase production.

That leverage, coupled with Mr. Trump’s jawboning of the Saudis, kept oil prices substantially below what they have been throughout the Biden regime.

From day one, President Biden declared war on fossil fuels. He canceled pipelines, curtailed drilling, discouraged fracking, and turned this nation into the oil supplicant that it is today.

Now, 1,000 days in, it is Saudi Arabia and Russia — the world’s two largest oil producers outside the U.S. — setting world oil prices. Saudi princes need at least $85 per barrel to fund the government programs it uses to pacify an increasingly restive population. Vladimir Putin’s Russia needs at least $100 a barrel of oil to fund its Ukrainian adventure.

The resultant oil price shocks are increasing our inflation rate at a time when the U.S. already faces significant inflationary pressures. Higher oil prices also act as a tax on consumers and thereby reduce purchasing power, with collateral negative demand and growth effects. Higher oil prices likewise increase the cost of production and transportation for businesses, reducing output and growth through negative supply effects.

Together, these negative growth effects represent the “stag” part of the oil price shock stagflation equation.

Normally, the Federal Reserve can treat oil price shocks as transitory, which is to say cyclical, and leave them out of the core inflation metric the Fed relies on to set short-term interest rates. If higher oil prices represent a secular, long-term trend because of a “Bidenomics”-driven tectonic shift, sustained oil price increases must be factored into the Fed calculus. That will surely mean higher interest rates for a far more extended period.

These economic risks pale in comparison with the national security risks from America’s increasing oil dependence and strategic energy subservience.

Take Russia: Even as American taxpayers are funding the Ukrainian war effort to the tune of tens of billions of dollars (while draining the U.S. arsenal), American consumers and businesses, through a pure wealth transfer, are funding the Russian war machine as more and more Russian oil creeps into world markets and trickles down to our gas pumps. The more oil revenue Russia captures, the less likely there will be peace and the more likely the United States will be dragged into a war on the European continent.

Mr. Biden, desperate for cheaper oil, has similarly relaxed sanctions on the sale of Iranian oil. Iranian oil production has climbed from about 2.7 million barrels daily at the end of the Trump administration to almost 3.5 million today.

With the price of oil now bouncing between $80 and $90, that’s an added $2 billion a month Iran has to both keep its regime afloat and finance attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia through proxies such as Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthi movement, the Muslim Brotherhood and Al-Mukhtar Brigades.

There is also Venezuela, the new Cuba in our midst. It, too, is being allowed by the Biden regime to increase its oil production, sell its oil in international markets to keep its toxic regime afloat, and export both its socialism to the rest of Latin America and its illegal aliens to American cities.

Finally, as a rising China eyes an invasion of Taiwan after taking Hong Kong without a whimper from the West, dictator Xi Jinping has leveraged the war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East to establish a yuan-denominated oil-trading bloc with Russia, Iran and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Xi now believes he has distanced China enough from the U.S. dollar and any collateral threats of sanctions, making war over Taiwan ever more likely.

The only way out now will be a quick return to strategic energy dominance. Here, Green New Deal Democrats must acknowledge that forcing Americans to reduce their demand for fossil fuels is a form of economic and national security suicide.

The math is simple: Whatever carbon dioxide reductions the American people might achieve through their sacrifices, massive subsidies, and destruction of our economy will be more than offset by the emissions from the new power plants and automobiles and factories of China, India, and a host of developing nations — and their leaders will laugh at us all the way to the climate change bank.

Sep 28 2023,Trump promises booming economy and seeks UAW endorsement in Michigan,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/trump-promises-booming-economy-uaw-endorsement,"

Former President Donald Trump promised a booming economy if returned to office and asked repeatedly for a union endorsement in a Michigan campaign speech.

Speaking before and then opposite the second GOP presidential debate, Trump made the case for a long-shot endorsement from the United Auto Workers, a union that is on strike.

NEWSOM DRAWS CONTRASTS WITH BIDEN AS HE LEADS DEMOCRATIC DEBATE COUNTERPROGRAMMING

“Do me a favor. Just get your union guys, your leaders to endorse me,” Trump said at one point, though he asked several times. “I’ll take care of the rest.”

Trump skipped the Republican debate in favor of his own stage at Drake Enterprises in Clinton Township, Michigan, hoping to draw viewers away from the seven contenders duking it out across the country in Simi Valley, California.

The hourlong speech focused heavily on the economy, filtered through the current UAW strike and the impact electric vehicles could have on industrial workers.

“[Electric vehicles] are built specifically for people who want to take a very short trip,” Trump said. “They say the happiest day when you buy an electric car is the first 10 minutes you’re driving it. And then after that, panic sets in because you’re worried, ‘Where the hell am I going to get a charge to keep this thing going?'”

People in the audience hoisted “Union Members for Trump” signs.

Though Trump is unlikely to get a UAW endorsement — the union’s president, Shawn Fain, has said another Trump term would be a “disaster” — he has historically pulled in a lot of support from rank-and-file union members.

Detroit-based UAW is one of the few unions yet to endorse President Joe Biden, mostly due to a dispute over electric vehicles. The Biden administration is aggressively pushing a transition to EVs and included electric car subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act.

UAW worries that EVs will mean fewer jobs because the cars require fewer parts, and Trump warned that the transition would not be successful in any case.

“The auto industry is being assassinated,” Trump said. “It’s a hit job on Michigan and on Detroit. … All of these cars will be manufactured in foreign lands that you couldn’t care less about.”

Michigan is a battleground state that Trump narrowly won in 2016 and narrowly lost in 2020, and both parties are focusing heavily on the state for 2024. Biden briefly campaigned in Michigan on Tuesday by visiting a UAW picket line.

Trump’s speech veered into several different policy areas, though the economy was the clear central focus throughout.

“I stood up to the people that hate you,” Trump told the crowd. “They hate you! Or maybe they hate our country.”

He bragged about renegotiating trade deals, imposing tariffs on China, and presiding over a strong economy during his first term.

“My greatest unsung achievement, I kept Chinese cars out of America,” Trump said to cheers. “UAW, is that OK? … If they took [Chinese tariffs] off, you’d be out of business right away.”

On a related note, he bragged that he would restore drilling for American oil, saying the country has enough gasoline to last another 500 years, all without damaging the environment.

“A few years ago, we were energy independent. Now we’re begging countries to give us gasoline,” Trump said. “Venezuela’s getting rich. We’re refining their tar.”

The crowd broke out into a “Trump! Trump! Trump!” cheer at one point as Trump wondered aloud if he was visiting one of his famous rallies.

Biden featured in the speech as well. Trump said the Democratic incumbent can’t find his way off of a stage and puts illegal aliens and “environmental lunatics” first. The four indictments against Trump were handed down by “the forces of evil,” he claimed, and Trump said ominously that such behavior “works both ways” when a new president takes office.

Trump promised to reverse Biden’s electric vehicle mandate on day one and said he’d make the United States energy independent again.

“My message to you tonight is that Michigan’s abuse under Joe Biden will end, and I will take you to new heights you’ve never dreamed of before,” Trump said. “Never even dreamed of.”"
Sep 28 2023,"Fact-checking the Republican candidates’ debate on immigration, crime, economy",The Dallas Morning News,center,https://dallasnews.com/news/politifact/2023/09/28/fact-checking-the-republican-candidates-debate-on-immigration-crime-economy,"The second Republican presidential primary debate had a raucous tone, with the seven candidates frequently talking over one another and the moderators calling for order. But themes quickly emerged, including the auto workers’ strike, crime, government spending, inflation and border security.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the polls, skipped the debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Participating candidates included North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.

The candidates leveled accusations about allegiances with foreign governments and increasing spending during one another’s tenures. We fact-checked many of their claims.

Immigration

Mike Pence: “Despite what’s said here today, we reduced illegal immigration and asylum abuse by 90%.”

Breaking News Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. SIGN UP Or with: Google Facebook By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

This is False.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, immigration plunged worldwide as governments enacted policies limiting people’s movement. In the U.S., Trump instituted Title 42, a public health policy authorizing the Border Patrol to immediately return most immigrants back to Mexico.

Advertisement

Before the pandemic, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported only enforcement actions under immigration law; its data during the pandemic includes actions under immigration law and Title 42.

Accounting for challenges in data comparisons, our review found a 300% increase in illegal immigration from February 2017, Trump’s first full month in office, to his last full month, December 2020.

One way to get close to Pence’s purported 90% illegal immigration decrease is by comparing data from May 2019, the month with the highest apprehensions during the administration, with data from April 2020, the month with that year’s lowest enforcement actions. But that’s a severely cherry-picked period.

Tim Scott: The southwest U.S. border under President Joe Biden is “unsafe, wide-open and insecure, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans in the last 12 months because of fentanyl.”

Advertisement

Scott’s claim is misleading. Deaths from fentanyl jumped 23% in Biden’s first year in office to more than 70,000. But they have been increasing since 2014 and also rose during Trump’s administration.

Although immigration encounters at the southern U.S. border have spiked under Biden’s watch, experts say most of the fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico is coming through legal ports of entry. The vast majority of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking are U.S. citizens, data shows.

Chris Christie: Donald Trump “built 52 miles of wall.”

Advertisement

The Trump administration built 52 miles of new primary border barriers — the first impediment people encounter if they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, that can block access for pedestrians or vehicles — where there were none before.

The administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary border barriers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.

The U.S.-Mexico border stretches for 2,000 miles across four states and a variety of terrain.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “They’re building cartel-financed tunnels underneath that wall. Semi trucks can drive through them.”

Advertisement

It’s accurate that there are cross-border, cartel-financed tunnels, but unlikely that they can accommodate semi trucks.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that cross-border tunnels have been found in California and Arizona and are associated with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. Since 1993, the Justice Department said authorities have found more than 90 tunnels, about 25 of them around San Diego.

Historically, these tunnels have been used primarily to smuggle marijuana and illegal drugs. By federal law, U.S. authorities must fill the U.S. side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered.

On average, U.S. semi trucks are around 8.5 feet wide and 13.5 feet tall. Underground cross-border tunnels tend to be long but not necessarily wide enough to fit the trucks. A tunnel found in 2022 between Tijuana, Mexico, and a warehouse in Otay Mesa, San Diego, had a diameter of 4 feet. Another one found in 2020 measured 5.5 feet tall and about 2 feet wide.

The economy and government spending

Doug Burgum: For electric vehicles, “the batteries come from China.”

In most cases today, this is accurate.

Data from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, shows China produces about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries, compared with 7% to 10% for the United States.

Advertisement

China is also home to 70% and 85%, respectively, of production capacity for two key parts of electric-vehicle batteries: cathodes and anodes.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August 2022, offers tax incentives for U.S. lithium-ion battery production and for the supply chain to produce them.

The U.S. also signed a memorandum of understanding in early 2023 to help build an electric vehicle battery supply chain in Congo and Zambia, countries with rich supplies of cobalt and other key minerals. This would keep these materials from being exported to China for processing, as happens now.

Advertisement

However, establishing a supply chain that’s competitive with China’s could take years, Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a transportation-focused business consulting company, told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle.

Chris Christie: Inflation is “caused by government spending.”

Government spending certainly affects inflation. But it’s not the only factor.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say it spurred inflation. They differ on how much the law affected inflation, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.

Advertisement

However, none of the experts PolitiFact talked to for a previous fact-check, liberal or conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID-19-related labor market disruptions, shifting energy prices and supply chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse.

Mike Pence: “Ron (DeSantis), you talk a really good game about cutting spending, but you’ve increased spending in Florida by 30%.”

We rated a similar claim Half True.

In 2018, the year before DeSantis became governor, Florida’s budget was about $88.7 billion. In 2023, DeSantis signed a $116.5 billion budget. That’s a 31% increase.

Advertisement

But Pence’s remark omits the other side of the ledger.

From 2018 to 2023, Florida tax revenue rose by about the same percentage as the state’s population grew. Pandemic federal aid boosted Florida’s budget, as it did in other states. And the Florida Legislature is required to pass a balanced budget for DeSantis to sign.

Nikki Haley: “Congress has only delivered a budget on time four times in 40 years.”

This is correct.

Advertisement

“In the nearly five decades that the current system for budgeting and spending tax dollars has been in place, Congress has passed all its required appropriations measures on time only four times,” the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group, wrote earlier this year.

Those were in fiscal years 1977, 1989, 1995 and 1997.

Mike Pence: “We brought 12,000 factories back to America during our administration.”

This is accurate, but needs context.

Advertisement

When then-President Donald Trump cited this statistic in his 2020 State of the Union address, CNN’s fact-checking unit called it “correct,” citing the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses data series and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

But the term “factories” includes everything from large to small establishments, and the pattern for total manufacturing employment was not as strong during the Trump-Pence administration as the pattern for manufacturing establishments.

From the start of Trump’s term to the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. manufacturing employment rose by 419,000. By comparison, since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, manufacturing employment has risen by 801,000, almost twice as fast in a shorter period.

Mike Pence: “Wages are not keeping up with inflation.”

Advertisement

It depends on the time frame measured. Pence is on track if you look at the start of Biden’s term to today. A standard measure of worker pay compared with inflation — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and older — shows that weekly wages were $373 in the first quarter of 2021, when Biden took office, and were $365 in the second quarter of 2023. That’s a 2% decline after accounting for inflation.

However, for each of the past four quarters — a yearlong period in which inflation has eased — wages have been rising faster than inflation. From 2022′s second quarter to 2023′s second quarter, weekly wages rose from $359 to $365 after inflation.

Also, inflation-adjusted wages today are just shy of where they were before the coronavirus pandemic, when they were $367 a week.

Vivek Ramaswamy: As president, I will “reduce the federal employee headcount by 75%.”

Advertisement

Legal experts told PolitiFact they are dubious about this plan, saying it would need congressional approval and could not be accomplished by presidential action alone.

Anne Marie Lofaso, a West Virginia University law professor, said Ramaswamy is arguing “that the president can unilaterally repeal a statute that authorizes the establishment of a government agency. That would be a radical revision of presidential power and a likely violation of separation of powers.”

Donald F. Kettl, the former dean of the University of Maryland’s public policy school, said a 2017 analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, rebutted Ramaswamy’s proposal. It concluded that the president “has no statutory authority to reorganize the executive branch, except where acts of Congress delegate authority to make particular changes.”

Tim Scott, to Nikki Haley: “As the U.N. ambassador, you literally put $50,000 on curtains.”

Advertisement

This is misleading. The U.S. State Department under the Obama administration purchased $50,000 curtains for the official residence of the ambassador to the United Nations, The New York Times reported.

In 2016, the State Department moved the ambassador’s official residence out of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan after a Chinese insurance company bought the hotel. The State Department leased a new residence in Manhattan and Haley became its first occupant when Trump named her U.N. ambassador in 2017.

Custom, mechanized curtains costing $52,701 were installed, but the decision to move the residence and buy the curtains was made before Haley’s tenure. In 2018, The New York Times’ published a story tying Haley to the curtains’ purchase, but later issued a correction, saying its earlier story “created an unfair impression about who was responsible for the purchase in question.”

Florida

Ron DeSantis: “We have a 50-year-low in the crime rate” in Florida.

Advertisement

Data for this claim is incomplete. Crime figures are low in Florida, but DeSantis’ statistic comes from a state database containing information from law enforcement agencies that represent only about 57% of the state’s population, a Sept. 20 NBC News report found.

The patchy data is related to Florida’s transition to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The FBI’s crime reporting database doesn’t support DeSantis’ figure either. Only 48 out of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. The numbers appear to be similar for 2022, according to an analysis by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization.

Ron DeSantis: 2.6 million Floridians without health insurance “is a symptom of our overall economic decline.”

Advertisement

When moderator Stuart Varney pressed DeSantis on the relatively high number of Floridians without health insurance — Varney said it’s 2.6 million — DeSantis blamed politicians in Washington, D.C.

But the numbers from DeSantis’ own state Health Department show no correlation between the economy’s condition and the number of Floridians without health insurance. Despite population growth and economic changes, Florida had about 2.6 million uninsured residents from 2018 through 2021, and about 2.4 million in 2022.

In 2022, Florida’s uninsured rate was 11.2%, higher than the 8% national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ron DeSantis: A proposed Florida school standard to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery was a “hoax that was perpetrated by Kamala Harris.”

Advertisement

DeSantis is dodging the facts. The Florida Board of Education set new social studies standards for middle schoolers July 19.

In a section about the duties and trades performed by enslaved people, the state adopted a clarification that said “instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”

Experts on Black history told PolitiFact that such language is factually misleading and offensive.

Transgender claims

Vivek Ramaswamy: “Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder.”

Advertisement

Medical experts disagree. Being transgender and having gender dysphoria — distress that some people may experience when their sex assigned at birth does not align with their gender identity — is not considered a mental health disorder. Historically, the diagnosis has carried the term “disorder,” but experts no longer view it as a pathology and are working to destigmatize the diagnosis.

Previous terms such as “gender identity disorder” and “transexualism” have evolved into “gender incongruence,” a condition the World Health Organization now considers a condition related to sexual health — not mental health. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, contains a diagnosis for “gender dysphoria,” but experts say it remains partly to let insurance companies cover gender-affirming care and let incarcerated people access care.

Mike Pence: Linn-Mar Community Schools in Iowa had a policy where “you could get a gender transition plan without notifying your parents.”

This needs more context. The Iowa school district in 2022 adopted a policy that allowed students to request a “gender support plan.” According to Axios, this plan would outline a student’s preferred name and pronouns as well as which locker rooms or bathroom the student would use, which is a social, rather than a medical, transition.

Advertisement

The student could choose whether the parents were informed, but the plan was not related to medical transition, which, for minors, requires the consent of parental guardians. Schools often don’t inform parents when students signal they are socially transitioning, The Washington Post reported.

Foreign affairs

Ron DeSantis: “I’ll be the first president elected since 1988 (who’s) actually served overseas in a war.”

This is accurate. DeSantis is the only military veteran among the 2024 presidential candidates, and would be the first U.S. president to have served overseas since President George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988.

Advertisement

DeSantis earned his law degree from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy as a lawyer, also known as a Judge Advocate General, or JAG, officer. His military records show he enlisted in 2004 during his second year at Harvard and served from 2005 to 2010.

He was stationed in Iraq with SEAL Team 1 from 2007 to 2008 as a senior legal adviser to Navy Capt. Dane Thorleifson, the commander of the Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “The reality is just because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.”

Ramaswamy disagreed with some of his opponents about aid to Ukraine, arguing the United States should limit its support for the country in its fight against Russia.

Advertisement

His point about political parties is accurate, but it needs context.

Ukraine banned 11 pro-Russian parties — the largest of which occupied 44 out of 450 seats in parliament, according to Radio Free Europe. The party’s leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, Radio Free Europe reported.

What role did the arts play for you personally during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns?

Did you turn to the work of individual writers, visual, or performing artists across television, movies, online and other mediums for entertainment and well-being?

Did you rely on programming from Delaware organizations like museums, theaters, community groups, restaurants and other venues for creative ways to unite us?

I did.

Witnessing this innovation and resilience of the arts and culture sector made me proud not just as a performing artist and patron of the arts myself, but as a Delawarean. For a small state, Delaware boasts a long list of artistic and cultural assets, and yet, we have not begun to gain broader recognition of their full potential.

In nearly one year in my role as executive director of the Delaware Arts Alliance (DAA), the nonprofit advocacy organization that serves as the unifying voice for the arts in our state, I have spoken to creatives from all backgrounds including individual artists, nonprofits organizations, for-profit creative businesses, and arts educators. They often feel underappreciated, undervalued and relegated to their own island. Yet, they feel hopeful that emerging from the pandemic provides an opportunity to position the creative economy as a key strategy for addressing other economic, social and policy issues in Delaware including attracting and retaining residents, workers, and visitors to the state.

In pursuit of this, and recognizing the profound connection among the arts, tourism and economic development, the Delaware Arts Alliance has embarked on an ambitious endeavor — the creation of a comprehensive plan to grow and support the creative economy through intentional policy change and investment.

Delaware’s “Creative Economy and Cultural Tourism Recovery and Growth Plan” will be the first project in the nation to deliver a unified vision and actionable policy agenda that aligns not only the entire arts and culture sector, but also state, county and local levels of government.

With funding from the American Rescue Plan (ARPA) Travel, Tourism & Outdoor Recreation program awarded by Governor John Carney and the Delaware Division of Small Business, the DAA will, over the course of the next year:

Produce an interactive, publicly available GIS map of Delaware’s creative economy;

Perform an economic impact study

Create comprehensive recovery plans for Delaware statewide, all three counties, and in select Opportunity Zones (Wilmington, Middletown, Smyrna, Dover, Milton, and Georgetown)

A series of community focus groups, surveys, and meetings summer-fall of 2023 will inform the direction of the project to ensure we hear from Delawareans from all backgrounds.

We know tourists and Delawareans alike seek authentic and immersive experiences, ranging from visiting museums, historical sites, and film and music festivals to partcipating in art exhibitions and performances. By supporting individual artists and organizations that make up the creative economy, Delaware can tap into a powerful engine of innovation, job creation, and community development.

We can bolster Delaware's tourism industry and overall economic recovery, and address pressing community issues from housing to health to education.

Learn more and get involved at www.delawareartsalliance.org/crea􀆟veeconomy.

Complete our survey by Oct 15th to help inform the development of this plan: delivr.com/2es2u.

(WMTV) - President Joe Biden made a stop Tuesday in Wisconsin to tout his administration’s economic policies.

After Air Force One touched down in Milwaukee, President Biden was greeted by Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. The president took time to greet military families on the tarmac at Milwaukee International Airport Air National Guard Base before heading for a tour of clean energy manufacturer Ingeteam.

President Biden and other Wisconsin officials shook hands with workers at Ingeteam when they arrived. He focused on manufacturing jobs in his speech at the facility and noted how the company plans to hire 100 workers using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law money to start producing electric vehicle charging stations domestically, according to the White House.

His visit comes a day before the one-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Sep 15 2023,US economy going strong under Biden – Americans don’t believe it,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/sep/15/biden-economy-bidenomics-poll-republicans-democrats-independents,"Americans do not trust the government’s economic news – or the media’s reporting of it – according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian that presents the White House with a major hurdle as it pushes Biden’s economic record ahead of next year’s election.

The US has roared back from the Covid recession by official measures. But two-thirds of Americans are unhappy about the economy despite consistent reports that inflation is easing and unemployment is close to a 50-year low. And the poll suggests many are unaware of or don’t believe the positive economic news the government has reported.

The results illustrate a dramatic political split on economic views – with Republicans far more pessimistic than Democrats. But unhappiness about the economy is widespread.

Two-thirds of respondents (68%) reported it’s difficult to be happy about positive economic news when they feel financially squeezed each month (Republicans: 69%, Democrats: 68%).

Two-thirds of Americans (65%) believe that the economy is worse than the media makes it out to be rather than better (35%).

In August the unemployment rate was 3.8%, close to a 50-year low. But the poll found that 51% wrongly believe that unemployment is nearing a 50-year high rather than those who believe it’s actually low (49%).

The lack of confidence in the economy has many academics and politicians puzzled. Some have blamed the US’s polarized politics and this was illustrated in the poll. But Harris’s data also shows that fears are widespread – and reinforced by disbelief of or ignorance about official figures and a mistrust of the media’s reporting of them.

Some 82% of Republicans and 66% of independents believe the economy is worse than the media’s portrayal. But nearly half of Democrats (49%) also said the media viewed the economy too favorably.

Overall, the poll found widespread despondency about the state of the economy. More than half of Americans (53%) believe the economy is getting worse instead of better or staying the same. Republicans and independents are more likely to think it’s getting worse (72% and 58%, respectively, v Democrats: 32%), while more Democrats think it’s getting better (32% v Republicans: 8%, independents: 13%).

The results paint a difficult picture for Joe Biden, who is making “Bidenomics” – his economic policy record – a central plank of his re-election platform.

The views of those familiar with Bidenomics showed a perhaps unsurprising party split. Some 60% of Democrats believe his plans are improving the US economy overall compared with 12% of Republicans.

There is a widespread belief that Bidenomics is good in theory but isn’t being implemented well – something both Democrats and Republicans agree with (62% v 58%).

Biden supporters have just launched a $13m advertising campaign extolling the president’s economic achievements, which include a landmark $1.2tn infrastructure and climate bill, massive investment in domestic microchips production and green energy solutions. His legislative actions are predicted to create 1.5m jobs per year for the next decade.

That message may be hard to sell given the widespread disbelief of and ignorance about the health of the US economy highlighted by the poll.

As well as being wrong about the unemployment data, respondents were unaware of, or chose to mischaracterize, other major economic data points.

The widest measure of economic growth – gross domestic product – increased at a 2.1% annualized rate last quarter and has been steadily improving since the Covid downturn. But more respondents (59%) believe that the US economy is shrinking this year than those who believe it is growing (41%). More Republicans (72%) and independents (63%) believe the economy is shrinking than do Democrats. But still, a sizeable 44% of Democrats believe the economy is shrinking.

The S&P 500 stock market index is up 16% so far this year. But 59% of respondents wrongly said they believe the S&P is down for the year compared with those who said they believe it is up (41%). The majority of all those asked said the S&P was down whether Republican (66%), independent (60%) or Democrat (52%).

US wages are, finally, growing faster than inflation. But 75% of those polled wrongfully believe that wages aren’t keeping up with inflation. That view is held by the majority of Republicans (84%), independents (75%) and Democrats (67%).

There was some good news for Biden. The poll found that 75% of respondents support at least one of the four main branches of Bidenomics: improving infrastructure, attracting high-tech electronics manufacturing, building clean energy manufacturing facilities and attracting more high-paying union jobs.

Still, 51% of Americans believe that government spending under the current administration is having a negative impact on the US economy (Republicans: 72%, independents: 54%, Democrats: 30%) rather than a positive impact (21%) or no impact (28%). And only just over a third of Democrats (35%) believe it’s having a positive impact (Republicans: 11%, independents: 16%).

“All these perceptual-reality gaps underscore Biden’s difficulty in claiming credit for economic gains. Americans either view the economy through their politics or aren’t feeling it in real life, or both,” said John Gerzema, the CEO of Harris Poll."

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) accused House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of leading an attempt to derail the economy with his launch of an impeachment inquiry for President Joe Biden.

Wasserman Schultz reacted Tuesday on MSNBC as McCarthy announced the inquiry while citing “serious and credible allegations” about Biden’s conduct and the alleged “culture of corruption” surrounding his family’s foreign business dealings. Asked for her thoughts about this, Wasserman Schultz accused McCarthy and the “extreme MAGA wing” of carrying out Donald Trump’s marching orders because he risked a government shutdown if he didn’t.

That’s what this is about. They are succumbing to Donald Trump, and they are allowing Donald Trump to hold our economy hostage. They are giving in to their extreme MAGA wing, and they will potentially, likely crash our economy, all while engaging in — they are afraid. They know they have nothing there, that there has been no evidence. They are using this word ‘inquiry.’ He just said they are going to move forward on impeachment because he’s in the pocket of Donald Trump.

Wasserman Schultz went on by arguing the contrast between Trump’s impeachments and the new Biden inquiry.

“They have acknowledged there’s no evidence against Joe Biden,” she said. “The House has to vote to move forward on an impeachment, period. They are adding the word ‘inquiry’ like they are still going to do some investigations. They have been investigating for months and months. They’ve acknowledged they have no evidence. They don’t need to move forward on impeachment other than Donald Trump has pressured them, that they are a wholly-owned subsidiary of his campaign, and they are giving into their extreme MAGA Republicans because Kevin McCarthy knows that one member can move to remove him. And the only thing he cares about is holding onto power.”

Sep 28 2023,"Fact-checking the second Republican debate: Candidates spar on immigration, crime, economy",Poynter,center,https://poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/second-republican-primary-debate-fact-check,"The second Republican presidential primary debate had a raucous tone, with the seven candidates frequently talking over one another and the moderators calling for order. But themes quickly emerged, including the auto workers’ strike, crime, government spending, inflation and border security.

Former President Donald Trump, the front-runner in the polls, skipped the debate, held at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. Participating candidates included North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.

The candidates leveled accusations about allegiances with foreign governments and increasing spending during one another’s tenures. We fact-checked many of their claims.

Immigration

Mike Pence: “Despite what’s said here today, we reduced illegal immigration and asylum abuse by 90%.”

This is False.

When the COVID-19 pandemic started, immigration plunged worldwide as governments enacted policies limiting people’s movement. In the U.S., Trump instituted Title 42, a public health policy authorizing the Border Patrol to immediately return most immigrants back to Mexico.

Before the pandemic, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported only enforcement actions under immigration law; its data during the pandemic includes actions under immigration law and Title 42.

Accounting for challenges in data comparisons, our review found a 300% increase in illegal immigration from February 2017, Trump’s first full month in office, to his last full month, December 2020.

One way to get close to Pence’s purported 90% illegal immigration decrease is by comparing data from May 2019, the month with the highest apprehensions during the administration, with data from April 2020, the month with that year’s lowest enforcement actions. But that’s a severely cherry-picked period.

It’s unclear what Pence means by “asylum abuse.”

However, based on bills Republican members of Congress have introduced to reduce “asylum abuse,” Pence might be referring to asylum seekers who are released into the U.S. to await their court cases and do not show up to their hearings. As PolitiFact has previously reported, most people who are released into the U.S. do attend their hearings.

Tim Scott: The southwest U.S. border under President Joe Biden is “unsafe, wide-open and insecure, leading to the deaths of 70,000 Americans in the last 12 months because of fentanyl.”

Scott’s claim is misleading. Deaths from fentanyl jumped 23% in Biden’s first year in office to more than 70,000. But they have been increasing since 2014 and also rose during Trump’s administration.

Although immigration encounters at the southern U.S. border have spiked under Biden’s watch, experts say most of the fentanyl coming into the U.S. from Mexico is coming through legal ports of entry. The vast majority of people sentenced for fentanyl trafficking are U.S. citizens, data shows.

Chris Christie: Donald Trump “built 52 miles of wall.”

The Trump administration built 52 miles of new primary border barriers — the first impediment people encounter if they’re trying to cross the southern border with Mexico, that can block access for pedestrians or vehicles — where there were none before.

The administration built 458 total miles of primary and secondary border barriers, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. The majority were replacements of smaller, dilapidated barriers.

The U.S.-Mexico border stretches for 2,000 miles across four states and a variety of terrain.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “They’re building cartel-financed tunnels underneath that wall. Semi trucks can drive through them.”

It’s accurate that there are cross-border, cartel-financed tunnels, but unlikely that they can accommodate semi trucks.

The Drug Enforcement Administration said in 2020 that cross-border tunnels have been found in California and Arizona and are associated with Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel. Since 1993, the Justice Department said authorities have found more than 90 tunnels, about 25 of them around San Diego.

Historically, these tunnels have been used primarily to smuggle marijuana and illegal drugs. By federal law, U.S. authorities must fill the U.S. side of tunnels with concrete after they are discovered.

On average, U.S. semi trucks are around 8.5 feet wide and 13.5 feet tall. Underground cross-border tunnels tend to be long but not necessarily wide enough to fit the trucks. A tunnel found in 2022 between Tijuana, Mexico, and a warehouse in Otay Mesa, San Diego, had a diameter of 4 feet. Another one found in 2020 measured 5.5 feet tall and about 2 feet wide.

The economy and government spending

Doug Burgum: For electric vehicles, “the batteries come from China.”

In most cases today, this is accurate.

Data from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization, shows China produces about three-quarters of all lithium-ion batteries, compared with 7% to 10% for the United States.

China is also home to 70% and 85%, respectively, of production capacity for two key parts of electric-vehicle batteries: cathodes and anodes.

The Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed in August 2022, offers tax incentives for U.S. lithium-ion battery production and for the supply chain to produce them.

The U.S. also signed a memorandum of understanding in early 2023 to help build an electric vehicle battery supply chain in Congo and Zambia, countries with rich supplies of cobalt and other key minerals. This would keep these materials from being exported to China for processing, as happens now.

However, establishing a supply chain that’s competitive with China’s could take years, Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a transportation-focused business consulting company, told the German news outlet Deutsche Welle.

Chris Christie: Inflation is “caused by government spending.”

Government spending certainly affects inflation. But it’s not the only factor.

The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say it spurred inflation. They differ on how much the law affected inflation, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%.

However, none of the experts PolitiFact talked to for a previous fact-check, liberal or conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID-19-related labor market disruptions, shifting energy prices and supply chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse.

Mike Pence: “Ron (DeSantis), you talk a really good game about cutting spending, but you’ve increased spending in Florida by 30%.”

We rated a similar claim Half True.

In 2018, the year before DeSantis became governor, Florida’s budget was about $88.7 billion. In 2023, DeSantis signed a $116.5 billion budget. That’s a 31% increase.

But Pence’s remark omits the other side of the ledger.

From 2018 to 2023, Florida tax revenue rose by about the same percentage as the state’s population grew. Pandemic federal aid boosted Florida’s budget, as it did in other states. And the Florida Legislature is required to pass a balanced budget for DeSantis to sign.

Nikki Haley: “Congress has only delivered a budget on time four times in 40 years.”

This is correct.

“In the nearly five decades that the current system for budgeting and spending tax dollars has been in place, Congress has passed all its required appropriations measures on time only four times,” the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan research group, wrote earlier this year.

Those were in fiscal years 1977, 1989, 1995 and 1997.

Mike Pence: “We brought 12,000 factories back to America during our administration.”

This is accurate, but needs context.

When then-President Donald Trump cited this statistic in his 2020 State of the Union address, CNN’s fact-checking unit called it “correct,” citing the Census Bureau’s Statistics of U.S. Businesses data series and the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.

But the term “factories” includes everything from large to small establishments, and the pattern for total manufacturing employment was not as strong during the Trump-Pence administration as the pattern for manufacturing establishments.

From the start of Trump’s term to the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. manufacturing employment rose by 419,000. By comparison, since Biden was inaugurated in January 2021, manufacturing employment has risen by 801,000, almost twice as fast in a shorter period.

Mike Pence: “Wages are not keeping up with inflation.”

It depends on the time frame measured. Pence is on track if you look at the start of Biden’s term to today. A standard measure of worker pay compared with inflation — median usual weekly inflation-adjusted earnings for full-time wage and salary workers age 16 years and older — shows that weekly wages were $373 in the first quarter of 2021, when Biden took office, and were $365 in the second quarter of 2023. That’s a 2% decline after accounting for inflation.

However, for each of the past four quarters — a yearlong period in which inflation has eased — wages have been rising faster than inflation. From 2022’s second quarter to 2023’s second quarter, weekly wages rose from $359 to $365 after inflation.

Also, inflation-adjusted wages today are just shy of where they were before the coronavirus pandemic, when they were $367 a week.

Vivek Ramaswamy: As president, I will “reduce the federal employee headcount by 75%.”

Legal experts told PolitiFact they are dubious about this plan, saying it would need congressional approval and could not be accomplished by presidential action alone.

Anne Marie Lofaso, a West Virginia University law professor, said Ramaswamy is arguing “that the president can unilaterally repeal a statute that authorizes the establishment of a government agency. That would be a radical revision of presidential power and a likely violation of separation of powers.”

Donald F. Kettl, the former dean of the University of Maryland’s public policy school, said a 2017 analysis by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, rebutted Ramaswamy’s proposal. It concluded that the president “has no statutory authority to reorganize the executive branch, except where acts of Congress delegate authority to make particular changes.”

Tim Scott, to Nikki Haley: “As the U.N. ambassador, you literally put $50,000 on curtains.”

This is misleading. The U.S. State Department under the Obama administration purchased $50,000 curtains for the official residence of the ambassador to the United Nations, The New York Times reported.

In 2016, the State Department moved the ambassador’s official residence out of the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan after a Chinese insurance company bought the hotel. The State Department leased a new residence in Manhattan and Haley became its first occupant when Trump named her U.N. ambassador in 2017.

Custom, mechanized curtains costing $52,701 were installed, but the decision to move the residence and buy the curtains was made before Haley’s tenure. In 2018, The New York Times’ published a story tying Haley to the curtains’ purchase, but later issued a correction, saying its earlier story “created an unfair impression about who was responsible for the purchase in question.”

Florida

Nikki Haley: “Ron DeSantis is against fracking. He’s against drilling.”

This claim from a contentious moment rates Half True.

Haley said DeSantis “always talks about what happens on Day 1. You better watch out because what happens on Day 2 is when you’re in trouble. Day 2 in Florida, you banned fracking, you banned offshore drilling, you did it on federal lands and you took green subsidies that you didn’t have to take.”

DeSantis interrupted Haley twice: “That’s not true,” he said.

Two days into his first term, DeSantis issued an executive order with several water policy reforms and directed the Department of Environmental Protection to push to end all fracking in Florida.

But as DeSantis noted in the debate, Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2018 to ban offshore drilling for oil and natural gas on lands beneath state waters. As a presidential candidate, DeSantis says he will honor Florida’s ban, but is open to fracking elsewhere.

Ron DeSantis: “We have a 50-year-low in the crime rate” in Florida.

Data for this claim is incomplete. Crime figures are low in Florida, but DeSantis’ statistic comes from a state database containing information from law enforcement agencies that represent only about 57% of the state’s population, a Sept. 20 NBC News report found.

The patchy data is related to Florida’s transition to incident-based crime reporting, the new federal standard, rather than the summary-based reports it has used since the 1970s. With summary reporting, if one incident resulted in multiple crimes, only the most serious would be reported. In 2021, the federal government stopped accepting this type of data and now requires states to report each crime.

The FBI’s crime reporting database doesn’t support DeSantis’ figure either. Only 48 out of 757 Florida law enforcement agencies participated in the FBI’s data collection in 2021. The numbers appear to be similar for 2022, according to an analysis by the Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization.

Ron DeSantis: 2.6 million Floridians without health insurance “is a symptom of our overall economic decline.”

When moderator Stuart Varney pressed DeSantis on the relatively high number of Floridians without health insurance — Varney said it’s 2.6 million — DeSantis blamed politicians in Washington, D.C.

But the numbers from DeSantis’ own state Health Department show no correlation between the economy’s condition and the number of Floridians without health insurance. Despite population growth and economic changes, Florida had about 2.6 million uninsured residents from 2018 through 2021, and about 2.4 million in 2022.

In 2022, Florida’s uninsured rate was 11.2%, higher than the 8% national rate, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Ron DeSantis: A proposed Florida school standard to teach that enslaved people benefited from slavery was a “hoax that was perpetrated by Kamala Harris.”

DeSantis is dodging the facts. The Florida Board of Education set new social studies standards for middle schoolers July 19.

In a section about the duties and trades performed by enslaved people, the state adopted a clarification that said “instruction includes how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.”

Experts on Black history told PolitiFact that such language is factually misleading and offensive.

Transgender claims

Vivek Ramaswamy: “Transgenderism, especially in kids, is a mental health disorder.”

Medical experts disagree. Being transgender and having gender dysphoria — distress that some people may experience when their sex assigned at birth does not align with their gender identity — is not considered a mental health disorder. Historically, the diagnosis has carried the term “disorder,” but experts no longer view it as a pathology and are working to destigmatize the diagnosis.

Previous terms such as “gender identity disorder” and “transexualism” have evolved into “gender incongruence,” a condition the World Health Organization now considers a condition related to sexual health — not mental health. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, contains a diagnosis for “gender dysphoria,” but experts say it remains partly to let insurance companies cover gender-affirming care and let incarcerated people access care.

Mike Pence: Linn-Mar Community Schools in Iowa had a policy where “you could get a gender transition plan without notifying your parents.”

This needs more context. The Iowa school district in 2022 adopted a policy that allowed students to request a “gender support plan.” According to Axios, this plan would outline a student’s preferred name and pronouns as well as which locker rooms or bathroom the student would use, which is a social, rather than a medical, transition.

The student could choose whether the parents were informed, but the plan was not related to medical transition, which, for minors, requires the consent of parental guardians. Schools often don’t inform parents when students signal they are socially transitioning, The Washington Post reported.

Foreign affairs

Ron DeSantis: “I’ll be the first president elected since 1988 (who’s) actually served overseas in a war.”

This is accurate. DeSantis is the only military veteran among the 2024 presidential candidates, and would be the first U.S. president to have served overseas since President George H.W. Bush was elected in 1988.

DeSantis earned his law degree from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Navy as a lawyer, also known as a Judge Advocate General, or JAG, officer. His military records show he enlisted in 2004 during his second year at Harvard and served from 2005 to 2010.

He was stationed in Iraq with SEAL Team 1 from 2007 to 2008 as a senior legal adviser to Navy Capt. Dane Thorleifson, the commander of the Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.

Vivek Ramaswamy: “The reality is just because (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is an evil dictator does not mean that Ukraine is good. This is a country that has banned 11 opposition parties.”

Ramaswamy disagreed with some of his opponents about aid to Ukraine, arguing the United States should limit its support for the country in its fight against Russia.

His point about political parties is accurate, but it needs context.

Ukraine banned 11 pro-Russian parties — the largest of which occupied 44 out of 450 seats in parliament, according to Radio Free Europe. The party’s leader, Viktor Medvedchuk, is aligned with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin is the godfather of Medvedchuk’s daughter, Radio Free Europe reported.

Sep 26 2023,Signature Travel Network’s Owners’ Meeting Brings $2 Million to Maui’s Economy,KHON 2,center,https://khon2.com/top-stories/signature-travel-networks-owners-meeting-brings-2-million-to-mauis-economy,"HONOLULU (KHON2) — Signature Travel Network has held an annual meeting in Maui for 67 years. With the Maui wildfire disaster, it was unclear whether the island would host once again, or even happen. However, after much consideration, Maui did in fact see almost 450 attendees, and along with them, $2 million in spending, funded into the local economy.

“There was obvious concern from the Signature Travel team for the people of Maui who were impacted by the devastation and whether it was even appropriate to be on the island so soon to hold their meeting,” said John Monahan, HVCB’s president and CEO. “We had many conversations keeping them updated on the situation as it evolved. As the weeks passed, it became clear to them that coming to Maui in a respectful and responsible manner was the best way for the group to help the residents and the economy.”

Signature Travel Network’s CEO Alex Sharp set several goals for travel advisors in attendance to set a standard of respect, responsibility and impactful tourism to the island and locals during such a difficult time.

“Holding our annual owners meeting in Wailea was not only the right decision, but it led to the best meeting of our 67-year history,” said Sharp. “For those attendees with initial hesitation that our event would distract from recovery efforts, all concerns were immediately put to rest as soon as they met local Maui residents, each of whom was there with open arms and gratitude for travelers returning to the island. Giving back to Maui gave our meeting purpose and the outpouring of gratitude lifted everyone’s spirits.”

Notable ways the group impacted the local community and economy include:

More than $400,000 in donations and silent auction proceeds for the Hawai‘i Community Foundation’s Maui Strong Fund, Maui Food Bank and Maui Humane Society.

An additional $75,000-$100,000 from AmaWaterways based on its booking incentive to give $100 per booking for the next month to the STN Travel Elevates Maui Relief Fundraising Effort.

More than 7,000 pounds of supplies donated and delivered to Maui charity partners.

Hundreds of volunteer hours helping to make meals, serve at the Maui Humane Society and to sort through donated items.

Tens of thousands of dollars spent at the “Maui Market” at The Andaz Maui on September 8 supporting local Maui vendors.

“The aloha shown by the entire Signature Travel Network towards the people of Maui was an incredibly beautiful thing to see,” said Daniel Nāho‘opi‘i, HTA’s interim president and CEO. “They demonstrated that it was possible to continue with their meeting on Maui during a very challenging time, and truly benefit the community in many ways during their stay with us. I extend my sincerest aloha and mahalo to Mr. Sharp and all the STM attendees for their courage and trust in staying the course.”

West Maui – Kā‘anapali, Nāpili, Honokōwai, and Kapalua – will reopen to visitors on Oct. 8 as per Gov. Josh Green.

Nov 14 2023,"Oy Vey, WashPost! Quit Treating Voters Like They’re Stupid for Recognizing Biden’s Economy Sucks",NewsBusters,right,https://newsbusters.org/blogs/business/joseph-vazquez/2023/11/14/oy-vey-washpost-quit-treating-voters-theyre-stupid,"The leftist Washington Post just can’t resist treating Americans as if they’re just dumb for thinking Bidenomics is a disaster despite their ongoing economic hardships.

The Post ran a condescending headline on Nov. 13 that was about as stupid as it was patronizing: “The economy is booming, but inflation continues to sour Americans.” The sub-headline was just as ridiculous: ""Rising wages and strong economic growth haven’t been enough to convince voters that the president’s policies are working for them.""

The leftist rag gaslighted voters by making it seem like they shouldn’t believe their lying eyes about the cost-of-living crisis they’re facing: “Most Americans are financially better off than they were before the coronavirus pandemic, but they feel worse about their economic prospects.”

In essence, Americans are supposedly just making up the fact that “[i]nflation has outpaced wage growth since 2021,” as investment company Social Finance (SoFi) reported on Oct. 31. “Since the start of 2020, the cost of living rose 18.3%, compared to a 17.6% increase for wages. This has resulted in negative nominal wage growth for the average American. In other words, your paycheck simply isn’t going as far,” SoFi concluded.

But the newspaper proceeded to deceive its readership by propagandizing about a supposed “string of eye-popping data points — strong economic growth, unemployment at longtime lows, wages finally outpacing inflation, all leaving Americans with more money in their bank accounts than they have had in years.” The newspaper put the blame for America’s disillusionment with Biden on “rising prices.” No kidding, Sherlock! Heritage economist EJ Antoni blasted The Post’s blatant deception in comments to MRC Business:

The gaslighting from the Biden administration and its lackeys in the media is truly astounding. It’s obvious why people say they’re worse off under Biden—it’s because they are. The fact that families are lied to about the economy is not going to change their perception of their own financial situation. For example, the latest line from the administration is that wages are outpacing inflation, but the administration’s own data say otherwise. Weekly earnings have fallen behind inflation for the last four months and the annual increase in weekly earnings has been outpaced by inflation in 27 of the last 31 months. That’s progress? Hardly, but it is ‘Bidenomics.’

Center for Freedom and Prosperity President Dan Mitchell also lambasted the newspaper for ""cherry-picking data."" As Mitchell put it, ""That would be the only logical explanation for the failure to acknowledge what's happened to median household income. And the author also conveniently ignores the data on labor force participation.""

MarketWatch reported on Nov. 13 that Americans were also racking up “record” credit card debt, hitting a whopping $1.08 trillion in the third quarter. In addition, the rate of new credit card delinquencies “rose to 2% in the third quarter, up from 1.7% in the first and second quarters of 2023. That’s the highest rate since at least 2015.”

But wait, there’s more!

Home affordability has also worsened, with the average income needed for a typical homebuyer skyrocketing to $107,000 (six figures) on average from $88,000 last year, a chilling 22 percent jump that marked the “highest annual increase on record” and put home ownership out of the reach of many Americans, according to CNN. The Post even conceded the point about horrific home affordability, but buried it in the sixth paragraph. “Financially better off,” eh Washington Post? Newsflash: If Americans are still struggling with high prices, they’re NOT “better off.”

The Post even attempted to once again prop up the Bidenomics boondoggle: “Biden has played a considerable role in improving Americans’ financial situation.” The Post based its absurd notion partially on government funding “infrastructure and green energy projects that have juiced the economy.” [Emphasis added.]

Cue the canned laughter. If by “juiced” The Post means Biden’s policies are squeezing the life out of the economy, then its verbiage makes sense. Prices have spiked over 17 percent since Biden took office. A new Financial Times poll also found that 55 percent of Americans say they’re worse off financially since Biden took office. USA Today even noted on Nov. 3 that “[t]he number of Americans working two or more jobs has reached its highest level since the pandemic’s start,” suggesting “more of us are feeling inflation’s pinch.”

But The Post, drunk on its obsession with Bidenomics, proceeded to browbeat those darn, ungrateful plebeians. “That disconnect between a booming economy and how Americans feel about it appears to be widening at a critical time ahead of next year’s presidential election. It is also shaping up to be a key liability for the White House, even as its policies are bolstering job creation and business investments,” The Post cried.

Conservatives are under attack. Contact The Washington Post at 202-334-6000 and demand it stop gaslighting Americans on their economic struggles."
Oct 06 2023,"US economy adds 336,000 jobs in September, blowing past expectations",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-september-2023,"U.S. job growth unexpectedly accelerated in September, evidence the labor market remains resilient even as it confronts high interest rates and stubborn inflation.

Employers added 336,000 jobs in September, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, almost double the 170,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. It marked the best month for job creation since January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.8%.

""The huge upside surprise in the monthly jobs report blew any ideas about a cooling labor market out of the water,"" said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. ""Regardless of whether another hike occurs, investors are facing the prospect of a hawkish Fed and high interest rates for the foreseeable future.""

The report also contained steep upward revisions to job growth earlier this summer. Gains for July and August were revised up by a total of 119,000 jobs to a respective 236,000 and 227,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is hotter than it previously appeared.

WORKERS NOW DEMANDING NEARLY $80K TO START NEW JOB

All of this may be of concern to the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it is closely watching the report for evidence the labor market is finally softening after more than a year of interest rate hikes. The surge in hiring — which threatens to keep inflation elevated — could provide the U.S. central bank fodder to approve another interest rate hike this year and hold rates at peak levels longer than previously expected.

The odds of a November rate hike jumped to 30% on Friday after the latest jobs data, up from 18% one week ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which tracks trading. Investors also raised their expectations of a December rate increase, with 45.2% of traders predicting another hike.

JOB OPENINGS UNEXPECTEDLY JUMP IN AUGUST

""The jump in employment, the extremely low level of unemployment claims, and the rise in job openings keep alive the possibility of the Fed raising rates one more time this year,"" said Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic. ""Moreover, it underscores that they will be in no hurry to cut rates — higher rates for longer.""

Stocks plummeted, and Treasury yields jumped following the report's release, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 191 points.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 38790.43 +75.66 +0.20% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 16103.44802 +130.27 +0.82% SP500 S&P 500 5149.42 +32.33 +0.63%

Still, there was a silver lining in the report on the inflation front.

Average hourly earnings — a key measure of inflation — increased 0.2% for the month and remain up 4.2% from the same time one year ago. Both figures came in below estimates, a welcome sign for the Fed.

Job gains were broad-based last month, with the biggest gains in leisure and hospitality (96,000), government (73,000) and health care (40,900).

KEY FED INFLATION GAUGE ACCELERATED AGAIN IN AUGUST AS HIGH PRICES PERSIST

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown. Although economists say it is beginning to normalize after last year's blistering pace, it is nowhere near breaking.

A separate report released Wednesday showed that job openings unexpectedly jumped to 9.6 million at the end of August, reversing three straight months of declines. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the highest on record was 7.6 million. There are still roughly 1.5 jobs per unemployed American.

The data, combined with historically low jobless claims, point to a labor market that remains resilient despite growing headwinds.

""Given how hot the job market is and how resilient the consumer is, it appears that the rapid rise in interest rates that we’ve seen — 550 bps in a year and a half — still hasn’t dampened the economy,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance."

Oct 05 2023,"CNHA moves convention to Maui in hopes of boosting economy, uplifting local voices",Hawaii News Now,center,https://hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/10/06/cnha-moves-convention-maui-hopes-boosting-economy-uplifting-local-voices,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement announced Thursday that it has chosen to relocate its annual convention from Oahu to Maui.

The organization said it decided to move the 22nd Annual Native Hawaiian Convention to focus on amplifying the voices of those on Maui who were impacted by the devastating wildfires.

“I believe there is no greater way to kāko’o Maui than to elevate the voices of the Maui people through the largest platform that CNHA can offer,” said Kuhio Lewis, CEO of CNHA.

“It was an easy decision in light of knowing that this was the right thing to do. We knew that this was important. This is the biggest venue that we can offer. Logistically it has its challenges, but I think we’re going to overcome those challenges and make sure that we give Maui the platform that they need right now.”

The annual convention includes various discussions, including culture, economic development, education, housing, health, tourism and community development. There will also be a special focus on Maui — its people, history and the vision the community has for the future.

CNHA said it hopes the convention can also provide an “extensive economic boost to the Maui community” by featuring a Maui Mākeke (marketplace) to showcase Maui-made products and vendors, local food trucks and restaurants, and a job fair.

The convention is scheduled to take place from Nov. 14 to 17 at the Maui Arts and Culture Center in Kahului.

Officials said 2,000 people are expected to attend the convention.

Registration is now open. For more information or to register, click here.

The registration fee for CNHA members is $100 and $175 for the general public. The cost includes:

Full access to all four days of convention activities

$30 in food vouchers that can be redeemed at onsite food trucks

Attendance to keiki hula hōʻike on Nov. 14

Discounted rates to partnering hotels

Hosted lunch on final day of convention

CNHA said registration fees will be waived for Maui residents that were impacted by the wildfire. Those interested in attending will need to visit CNHA’s Kāko’o Maui Resource Center located at Maui Mall to register.

Jul 27 2023,US Economy Grows Moderately as GDP Ticks Up,The Daily Caller,right,https://dailycaller.com/2023/07/27/us-economy-gdp-growth/,"The U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2.4% in the second quarter of 2023, according to gross domestic product (GDP) statistics released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on Thursday morning.

Real GDP increased by 2.0% in the first quarter of 2022 after being revised up from an initial estimate of 1.1%, according to the BEA. Economists expected the GDP would be around 2% in the second quarter of 2023, following high inflation and an interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday.

“That’s not great, but not terrible—at least in normal circumstances.” E.J. Antoni, research fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, told the Daily Caller News Foundation.

“Virtually every economic indicator is pointing to recession, probably starting sometime around December,” Antoni added. “The Biden administration made a bad fiscal situation inestimably worse by stomping on the gas and further increasing the spending, borrowing, and printing of money by the government. That simultaneously caused 40-year-high inflation and crowded out private investment, both of which are starving economic growth.”

The Federal Reserve announced its 11th interest rate hike since March 2022 on Wednesday in an effort to rein in inflation, which, though decreasing, is still elevated above target levels. The federal funds rate currently sits at 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest since January 2001.

Inflation ticked down but remained well above the target range in June, increasing 3.0% on an annual basis compared to 4.0% in May, while Core CPI, which excludes energy and food, remained higher at 4.8% for the year in June, compared to 5.3%. Energy prices rose only 0.6% in June, showing a fall of 16.7% for the year.

The 2.4% figure is an advanced estimate and will be updated as additional data becomes available, according to the BEA.

Sep 04 2023,Biden 2024 weaknesses highlighted as majority disapprove of age and economy: Poll,Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/joe-biden-weaknesses-economy-age-poll,"President Joe Biden‘s biggest hurdles for his reelection campaign are his handling of the economy and his age, two areas that could have implications for voters in 2024.

A Wall Street Journal poll shows that 73% of respondents believe that Biden is too old to run for president again, with 60% indicating that they do not believe Biden is “mentally up for the job.”

A majority of registered voters, 59%, also said they disapproved of how Biden has handled the economy, with 63% of voters saying the same for inflation and 58% saying the same for the growth of the middle class.

The poll comes as the president continues to tout “Bidenomics,” his administration’s economic agenda, as the cause of positive economic developments, including slowing inflation and job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued its employment report on Friday, announcing that the economy beat expectations and added 187,000 jobs in August.

The economy remained the top priority for voters who responded to the poll, with 24% saying it will affect who they would vote for in the 2024 presidential election, followed by immigration at 11%, abortion at 8%, and inflation at 6%.

Among registered voters, 36% rated the strength of the U.S. economy as “poor,” and 32% rated the economy as “good.” Among Republican primary voters, 61% selected a “poor” rating.

In a negative outcome for Biden, 58% of voters said the economy has gotten worse over the past two years, compared to the 28% of voters who said it has gotten better since Biden took office.

Still, voters are evenly split on which candidate they would support if the 2024 election were held today, with both former President Donald Trump and Biden getting 46% support.

Biden campaign aides told the Wall Street Journal that it is still early into the 2024 race and that most voters have not started tuning into the general election yet.

“Wages are growing faster than inflation. This didn’t just happen. We made it happen,” Biden said on Monday during a Labor Day rally with union members in Philadelphia.

Biden took a swing at Republicans on Monday, who he said are claiming that “America’s failing.”

“They’re wrong,” the president said. “America has the strongest economy in the world right now today. Lowest inflation rate among any major economy, 13. 5 million new jobs, and there’s no one reason for it.”

The poll was conducted from Aug. 24-30 with a survey of 1,500 registered voters and a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points."

China is experiencing the opposite problem: People and businesses are not spending, pushing the economy to the verge of a pernicious condition called deflation.

Consumer prices in China, after barely rising for the previous several months, fell in July for the first time in more than two years, the country’s National Bureau of Statistics announced on Wednesday. For 10 straight months, the wholesale prices generally paid by businesses to factories and other producers have been down from a year earlier. Real estate prices are tumbling.

Those patterns have amplified concerns about deflation, a potentially crippling pattern of broadly falling prices that tends to also depress the net worth of households — as it did in Japan for years — and make it very hard for borrowers to repay their loans.

Deflation is particularly serious in a country with very high debt, like China. Overall debt is now larger in China, compared with national economic output, than in the United States."

Enjoy this free story!

The University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization says the Aug. 8 wildfires will lead to sharp, persistent economic losses on Maui, with limited spillovers for the rest of the state’s economy. Read more

Wildfires have delivered a “heavy blow” to Maui’s economy and will exert costs on the county and state that will last well into the future, according to a University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization report released today.

UHERO’s latest forecast is its first assessment of how the firestorm and its aftermath will affect Maui’s economy over the next several years, and what that downturn will mean for the overall state economy.

The group’s assessment: The wildfires will lead to sharp and persistent economic losses on Maui, with limited spillovers for the rest of Hawaii’s economy.

While Maui represents about 30% of the state’s visitor industry, it comprises just over 10% of Hawaii’s overall economy, UHERO director Carl Bonham said Thursday during a virtual news conference to discuss the group’s third-quarter forecast results.

Bonham said UHERO now expects the state’s overall gross domestic product to fall about half a percentage point from its previous forecast.

“The economy will grow more slowly, and then it will sort of rebound in a sort of typical fashion after a disaster,” he said. “It will look like the state economy is doing quite well in 2025 and 2026 — not so much in 2024.

“The overall state economy will weather this Maui downturn, and we’ll actually see a boost in overall economic activity — job growth and particularly construction activity,” he said. “Overall GDP growth will be higher in 2025 and 2026 and 2027 than we had forecast before the fires.”

While UHERO expects rebuilding will boost the state’s GDP, the forecast’s authors said, “this does not capture the value of lost homes and businesses and the non-pecuniary costs of displacement, trauma, and so forth.”

Current economic costs from the fires are mounting for the county and the state. Depending on the level of federal funding, UHERO said the state could incur substantial recovery costs for the next half-decade or longer.

UHERO is forecasting real personal income and tax revenues will decline, and statewide income growth is projected to slow to below 2% in 2024.

The state Council on Revenues reduced its forecast for state general fund revenues for fiscal 2024 to just 1.3% growth, down from an earlier estimate of 4%.

However, UHERO expects that the planned reopening of unaffected areas of West Maui to tourism Oct. 8 will reduce Maui revenue losses.

Because Maui represents about 30% of Hawaii’s tourism, the island’s struggles mean the visitor industry will suffer.

Bonham said Maui lost over $13 million of visitor spending each day in the weeks following the fire when arrivals plunged by nearly 75%. He said West Maui’s tourism reopening will restart tourism in the region, but recovery is expected to ramp up gradually.

“There has to be a time for the industry and the (Hawaii Tourism Authority), etc., to tell the world that we are reopening, and ideally you would like that message to get out in time for people to plan for later in the fall, whether it’s Thanksgiving or Christmas and New Year’s — the peak travel periods,” he said.

State Business, Economic Development and Tourism Director James Kunane Tokioka told the Honolulu Star-Advertiser on Thursday that the reopening of West Maui, which accounts for 15% of Hawaii’s tourism economy, is critical to the economies of both the Valley Isle and the state.

“There has been outreach to many community leaders and ILWU as the largest hotel union in West Maui,” Tokioka said in an email. “Some are reluctant, but we are listening to the guidance of many hotel workers asking to reopen and return to normalcy. A delayed opening would lead to more employees being laid off and without medical benefits.”

Bonham said he expects that even with the reopening it will be year’s end before Maui visitor arrivals surpass 50% of their 2022 level. He said visitor arrivals are not expected to reach 80% of their 2022 level until the end of 2024.

The UH economist said recovery after 2024 is expected to slow again due to some travelers’ reluctance to visit Maui and the island’s continued temporary housing needs.

In the wake of the fires, nearly 8,000 survivors and hotel employees have been housed in over 2,400 units across about 40 lodging properties, including hotel, timeshare and Airbnb units.

Gov. Josh Green said during a Thursday news conference, “We are beginning the process of transitioning survivors out of hotels and into longer-term housing, including additional vacation rental and condo-hotel housing, that will begin to feel at least a little bit more normal for those deeply affected.”

The Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corp. has placed over 300 families through the Hawaii Fire Relief Housing Program, which has about 1,200 property listings. The state also is having discussions with Expedia-VRBO about adding housing for displaced survivors.

Tokioka said that “with regards to moving survivors out of hotels, the situation is fluid.” He said the Joint Housing Task Force is trying to confirm units with kitchens, in particular.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has reported receiving 15,931 registrations for services and will support more than 18 months of rental assistance for survivors.

Bonham said rebuilding homes for the thousands of families displaced by the Lahaina fires will take years, straining an already tight and expensive Maui housing market.

“The recovery of the overall economy and the tourism economy will be very much influenced in 2024 by what happens in the housing and the reconstruction phase and the need to continue to house displaced residents and emergency workers and visiting federal employees and eventually construction workers — all of that will come together to essentially slow the process of recovery in the tourism space,” he said.

Bonham said fires destroyed the vast majority of businesses and jobs in Lahaina, and even local businesses outside that impact zone are struggling because of the tourism downturn.

He noted that spending to meet Maui’s disaster and recovery needs will create jobs.

UHERO’s forecast estimates that Maui’s unemployment rate will soar above 11% in the fourth quarter. Though UHERO expects the unemployment rate will gradually recede, economists do not expect it to dip below 4% until late 2026.

UHERO expects statewide job growth will fall below 2% this year and to 1% in 2024.

Bonham said a likely federal government shutdown on Oct. 1 threatens further disruption, but, as rebuilding ramps up, jobs are expected to rise slightly above UHERO’s previous forecast."
Sep 22 2023,"UHERO: Wildfires deliver ‘heavy blow’ to Maui economy, rebuilding challenges detailed",Maui Now News,center,https://mauinow.com/2023/09/22/uhero-wildfires-deliver-heavy-blow-to-maui-economy-rebuilding-challenges-detailed,"More than 2,200 structures were damaged or destroyed in the Lahaina wildfire.PC: DLNR Hawaiʻi (8.15.23)

The University of Hawaiʻi Economic Research Organization just released its third quarter forecast for 2023, the first since the Maui wildfires. The document assesses the impacts of the fires’ aftermath on the path of Maui’s economy over the next several years, and what that means for the rest of the state.

“The report is very much focused on Maui and what has turned into an extremely sharp downturn in economic activity across the island as a result of the fires, and the loss of visitor spending,” said UHERO Executive Director Carl Bonham in a Zoom media call on Thursday.

The report shows Maui lost more than $13 million of visitor spending each day in the weeks following the fire. “That spread very quickly outside of the Lahaina and West Maui area to impact the entire island,” said Bonham.

In the early days following the Aug. 8 wildfire, visitor arrivals plunged by nearly three-quarters, as travelers responded to early appeals to stay away, according to the UHERO report.

In addition to lost visitor arrivals and spending, Maui is also facing “rapid and severe” effects on employment. “We saw a sharp increase in unemployment claims—over 4,000 in the second week after the fires, and in total, we’re getting close to 10,000 claims for new unemployment benefits since the fire,” said Bonham.

In addition to the displacement of residents directly impacted by the fire’s path, the wildfire also destroyed many businesses and jobs in Lahaina. The UHERO forecast calls for the Maui unemployment rate to soar above 11% in the fourth quarter, and to “only gradually recede,” not dipping below 4% until late 2026.

“That’s going to continue until we really get the visitor spending back,” said Bonham, who said he expects this to be a “relatively slow recovery.”

VC: UHERO

The state is already seeing the “beginnings of Maui tourism recovery,” according to the UHERO report, with resorts in Central and South Maui to be the first areas to see substantial recovery.

With the planned Oct. 8 reopening of unaffected West Maui resort areas, economists are not anticipating a rush to travel, but a gradual recovery instead.

“While we recognize that West Maui is supposed to reopen in early October, we expect that will be a long drawn out process… For the fourth quarter we expect total visitors to Maui to be roughly 50% of where they were in 2022. So instead of almost 800,000 visitors each quarter, we’re talking about 400,000 visitors in a quarter.”

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

By the end of 2024, the UHERO forecast calls for visitor arrivals to climb back up to around 80%. After that, gains will be gradual “because of continued temporary housing needs and lingering reluctance of some travelers.”

“The recovery of the overall economy and the tourism economy will be very much influenced in 2024-on by what happens in the housing reconstruction phase, and the need to continue to house displaced residents and emergency workers, and visiting federal employees and eventually construction workers,” said Bonham.

“All of that will come together to essentially slow the process of recovery in the tourism space, but if you look at total payroll jobs in the islands, we’d think that spending of federal dollars will actually make the job recovery look like its faster than the tourist recovery—and it will be faster because of the money that’s being spent.”

Recent job fairs have advertised hiring events for both FEMA and Red Cross, which are looking to hire temporary workers locally to assist in the recovery phase. There’s also job training and workforce certification taking place via the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement’s Kākoʻo Maui Resource Hub at Maui Mall Village in Kahului.

When looking at the state as a whole, Bonham said it will look like the state economy is doing quite well in 2025 and 2026.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

“While Maui is incredibly important to the overall state visitor industry, as a share of the overall economy, it’s just a little bit more than 10% of the state economy. So the overall state economy will weather this Maui downturn, and will actually see a boost in overall economic activity, job growth and particularly construction activity… The economy will grow more slowly and then it will rebound in a sort of typical fashion after a disaster,” he said.

Risk is ‘very real’ to rebuild and still afford to live

As for housing, the report shed some light on the risks involved with rebuilding and the cost a family would incur, living in a rebuilt Lahaina.

The report states: “When reconstruction is eventually complete, the housing stock will be new-build housing in a coveted location. Market prices for this new housing are likely to far exceed the already high prices that existed in Lahaina before the fire.”

Bonham called the risk “very real.”

In order for that risk to not occur, Bonham said there are going to have to be policy changes and a concerted effort to build housing across the entire island.

“I think the risk is very large and the challenge is to grow housing across the entire island and then to allow for workforce housing in and around Lahaina,” said Bonham. “Anything that’s new that isn’t high-density is going to be barely within reach of the median household income—simply because it’s brand new and the bottom line is that new housing is rarely affordable housing.”

Bonham notes that less than 1% of the burn area land is zoned for multi-family. The vast majority, he said, is zoned for either commercial or single family.

“That’s a huge problem, because you take a single family lot in the desirable area, and the incentive is to build a nice home on it. What we need to be able to do is build multi-family housing in a variety of places,” saying changes need to occur in the County’s zoning rules that allow for smaller lot sizes and higher density.

“There’s a challenge there because that’s not historically what was in Lahaina, so if you’re trying to maintain a historic structure, that’s not going to be duplexes and four-story… but that’s the way you get housing done that isn’t million dollar plus homes. You’ve got to have more density,” he said.

The UHERO report notes that modified regulation of short term vacation rentals in Lahaina may also be forthcoming, which could help to mitigate some of the “upward pressure” on demand and prices.

The median price for a single-family home on Maui was last listed at $1,197,500 in August of 2023, according to the Realtors Association of Maui. On top of the median, high mortgage rates have made housing “extremely unaffordable for a typical family,” according to the UHERO report.

“Even if a household could afford a 20% downpayment, in order to keep mortgage payments on the median home below 30% of income, a Maui household would need an annual income of $220,000. Fewer than 10% of Lahaina’s households earn this much,” the report states.

As for renters, about half of the residential population of Lahaina fall into this category.

“While insured homeowners may recoup losses through insurance claims, renters are left with few options for long term housing,” according to the UHERO report.

While the typical renter in Lahaina was paying $1,700/mo. in rent (according to the US Census Bureau), the median priced Craigslist rental listing on Maui is currently $2,500, the report states.

Additional key takeaways outlined in the Sept. 22 report include the following:

The fire in Lahaina displaced thousands of families, and rebuilding homes will take many years. Homes made up 86% of the roughly 2,200 lost structures, about 3% of Maui’s housing stock. The state and county are working to find longer-term housing for about 7,000 displaced persons who are now being accommodated in hotels, timeshares and temporary vacation rentals. Recovery workers and an eventual army of construction laborers must also be housed. Until substantial rebuilding can be accomplish ed, these needs will press hard on the already tight and expensive Maui housing market.

While the Maui wildfires will lead to sharp and persistent economic losses on the Valley Isle, spillovers to the rest of Hawaiʻi will be limited. Because Maui represents a significant share of Hawaiʻi tourism, aggregate visitor industry measures will of course fall. And the external conditions that underpin Hawaiʻi tourism remain unsettled. The US economy now looks likely to avoid recession, but further Fed rate increases could upset that. Global conditions have weakened, both in Europe and China, and the renewed fall of the yen will hinder the slow Japanese visitor market recovery.

Construction projects in other counties will have to compete with Maui recovery needs, but in most sectors we do not expect significant changes from the forecast we were developing before the fires. Statewide job growth will dip below 2% this year and to 1% in 2024. A likely federal government shutdown threatens further disruption. The number of jobs thereafter will be a bit above our previous forecast as rebuilding ramps up.

Real personal income will be adversely affected by employment losses on Maui, even with federal support for Maui families. Statewide income growth will slow to below 2% in 2024. Gross domestic product will be raised somewhat by rebuilding, but this does not capture the value of lost homes and businesses and the non-pecuniary costs of displacement, trauma and so forth.

Tax revenues will be hit hard by the disaster. The reopening of West Maui will help to reduce Maui revenue losses, as will Maui’s 0.5% GET surcharge that begins January 1, 2024. The State Council on Revenues has reduced its forecast for State General Fund revenues for fiscal 2024 to just 1.3% growth, down from an earlier estimate of 4%. Depending on the level of federal funding, the state will incur substantial recovery costs for at least the next half-decade.

The authors explained that as more information surfaces regarding Maui’s recovery, the forecast can be refined in the months and years ahead.

Mar 12 2024,"Elderly retirees face big losses after Chinese trust goes bust, reflecting turbulent economy",Quartz,center,https://qz.com/elderly-retirees-face-big-losses-after-chinese-trust-go-1851330814,"CHENGDU, China (AP) — Some investors in a troubled trust fund in China are facing financial ruin under a government plan to return a fraction of their money, casualties of a slump in the property industry and a broader economic slowdown.

Sichuan Trust, headquartered in the southwest city of Chengdu, announced it was insolvent in 2020, stricken by sketchy accounting and failed investments in shopping malls and other projects. A deadline earlier this month to accept a 20%-60% “haircut” or loss on their investments has left some investors in deep financial trouble, according to public announcements and AP interviews with five people affected.

China’s economy, the world’s second largest, depends heavily on real estate development to drive growth and create jobs. Property prices and sales have languished after a crackdown on what leaders viewed as dangerous levels of borrowing, causing dozens of developers to default on their debts.

Advertisement

At the National People's Congress session in Beijing last week, officials pledged to do more to protect investors. Premier Li Qiang said China would work to control risks and resolve the property crisis.

For the people who put their life savings into Sichuan Trust and similar entities, it's likely too late. Around 300 of more than 8,000 investors refused to accept a government plan and are looking for legal help, a relative of one investor said. A few who attempted to come to Beijing during the congress to air their grievances were blocked by police, the relative said.

The ruling Communist Party faces a dilemma: Debt is a problem, but falling home prices lead people to scrimp on spending. That squeezes companies' sales, so they lay off workers and cut back on investment. The result: slowing growth and less wealth to go around.

Inevitably, someone will end up losing out as China’s debt crisis unwinds, said Tsinghua University finance professor Michael Pettis.

“Nobody wants to absorb the loss. If you assign it to households, you weaken consumption even more,” Pettis said. “It’s got to be assigned. And that’s the political problem.""

Trusts are a cross between a bank and an investment fund. Some advertised their offerings as reliable, high interest government-backed accounts. They're actually private entities that fund projects like factories and shopping malls. Weak disclosure requirements allowed them to use money from new investors to pay what they owed earlier ones, a set-up somewhat like a Ponzi scheme.

“Financial supervision was relatively loose in the past, so the design of these products, including systems for protecting investors’ rights and interests, had serious issues,” said Zhu Zhenxin, chief analyst at Rushi Finance Institute in Beijing. “If underlying assets of financial products won't generate enough returns to pay such high interest rates, default is inevitable.”

Advertisement

The troubles at Sichuan Trust first surfaced when the government began restricting new sales of trust products in 2020. Without revenue from new investors, it couldn't pay its outstanding debts.

That summer, Sichuan Trust announced it had 25.3 billion RMB ($3.5 billion at the time) in debts it couldn't repay. The provincial government and banking regulators took control, ousting the management, reorganizing its books and launching an investigation.

Hundreds of investors staged weekly protests outside the company’s headquarters and their losses became a political issue.

In 2021, police detained Sichuan Trust’s majority shareholder Liu Canglong, a mining and real estate tycoon who was once the richest man in Sichuan, a province of more than 80 million people. He is accused of embezzling trust funds.

In December, the trust announced it would return investors’ funds according to a sliding scale of the original investment. The larger the investment stake, the larger the loss.

That sparked more protests.

“We’re extremely anxious,” one investor who asked not to be named told The AP. “It’s so cruel, the amount of money they’re giving us is so little.”

Advertisement

A person answering Sichuan Trust's hotline said the company does not take interviews and would not provide comment. Sichuan Trust, the Sichuan provincial government and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to faxed and emailed requests for comment.

The plan to return funds “appropriately favors small and medium-sized investors,” Sichuan Trust said earlier in a public statement, calling it “fair.”

Those protesting fear say they've been harassed and intimidated, subjected to police interrogations and threats from their children’s employers. They've been barred from leaving Chengdu or, at times, their housing compounds.

On a recent visit to the company's headquarters, dozens of uniformed officers, half a dozen police vehicles and an empty bus were parked outside. More than a dozen plainclothes agents who refused to identify themselves followed two AP journalists around.

Earlier, a Dutch journalist was shoved to the ground and forced into a police vehicle when he attempted to approach protesting investors.

“They abduct you, they threaten your children,” said another investor, who also did not want to be identified due to fears of more police harassment. “They have so many dirty tricks.”

Advertisement

Analysts say investors were bound to suffer big losses given the size of Sichuan Trust’s debts. Chinese media have reported on the problem, but focused on alleged wrongdoing by those who ran the trust, presenting the repayment plan as a fair solution.

Some of the more than 95% of investors who signed off on the plan said they agreed under duress and were threatened with bigger losses if they didn't meet a March 5 deadline.

Trusts have a high minimum investment — for Sichuan Trust it was generally 300,000 yuan ($42,000) — and many people believed mostly the relatively well-off were affected.

However, some investors were retirees who said they met the investment threshhold by collecting money from friends and relatives who now want their money back. For them, Sichuan Trust’s default is a calamity.

Advertisement

“They’re so poor, they don’t have money to spend,” said a relative of investors who lost money to the trust. “They don’t have money for medical treatment. They have to borrow money to survive.”

Those interviewed said the name Sichuan Trust led them to believe it was a trustworthy financial institution like a bank, with a steady, fixed interest rates, rather than a risky investment fund. They were attracted by the 8% or 9% interest rates it promised – multiple times higher than traditional savings accounts. Some financially unsophisticated retirees invested large chunks of their life savings.

“The country said trusts are very safe, like banks,"" one of the people said. “We didn't think there would be problems.”

Instead of enjoying their retirements, two of the people said, they've had to borrow money from relatives and cut back on their expenses.

Advertisement

“We ordinary people are miserable,” another investor said. “The corruption is so serious.”

China's roughly $3 trillion trust sector is part of a large “shadow banking” industry in the country, which for decades supplied credit to entrepreneurs and households not served by the state-run banking system. Concerned over speculation and illegal practices, authorities have tightened controls. In 2020, regulators declared victory in cleaning up China's online peer-to-peer lending industry, or P2P.

Advertisement

Wealth management companies also have gotten into trouble.

“We believe risks could increase, potentially affecting more financial-sector entities, if China’s economic recovery continues to lose momentum and the property sector’s distress is sustained,” Fitch Ratings said in a report after the collapse of another big trust company, Zhengrong.

Advertisement

Officials and analysts say crackdowns have been necessary, but investors footing the bill are questioning how they've been carried out.

“I support the Communist Party very much,"" one of the investors said. “But some people are blackening the Party's name.”

The report stated there will be a downshift in the economy and the growth will come more from local sources, including the construction to rebuild Lahaina.

According to the forecast, “on the Valley Isle, the initial visitor recovery after the wildfires has proven somewhat stronger than expected, but rebuilding will take a long time, with many uncertainties about how this will play out.”

The state saw near-historic highs with real visitor spending in the first quarter, even though visitor arrivals fell during the second half of 2023.

Reports showed an uptick in Canadian and Japanese visitors, but trends of poor purchasing power of foreign currencies proved to remain a challenge.

The UHERO forecast also revealed that the construction industry will reach new heights as well.

Over $500 million will be utilized for the Maui Interim Housing Plan for debris removal, rebuilding permits, and to address the housing shortage.

The state will also be increasing restrictions on short-term rentals to push property owners back to long-term housing.

The labor market amongst the islands proved to be both steady and healthy, as employment increased on Big Island, Oahu, and Kauai.

To meet the building needs of both Maui and Oahu, 2500 workers will be added to crews over the next three years to contribute to the Maui Interim Project and other housing projects.

Amid deflationary risks, a prolonged downturn in the real estate market and dampened business confidence, Li said the government was “keenly aware” of the challenges ahead.

Opening the annual session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, Li said the government was aiming for around 5 per cent growth, roughly as much as it grew in 2023.

“Global economic growth lacks steam and the regional hotspot issues keep erupting. This has made China’s external environment more complex, severe and uncertain,” he said.

But there was no announcement of any splashy quick fixes. The government would press on with a “proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy”, the premier said, suggesting no major change in the leadership’s approach to the economy.

That strategy was reflected in other targets. As in 2023, the government is aiming for an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 per cent and is pushing for the creation of more than 12 million new jobs in cities this year. The goal is in range of the 11 million target and 12.44 million jobs created last year, according to official data.

Inflation is forecast to be around 3 per cent, the same target as 2023, and well above the mere 0.2 per cent actual inflation of last year.

China kept its headline fiscal deficit at last year’s 3 per cent target.

But China will issue 1 trillion yuan (US$139 billion) in central government special bonds and 3.9 trillion yuan in local government ones.

In addition, it announced it would issue “ultra-long term special treasury bonds” starting this year and over each of the next several years, in order to “systematically address funding shortage facing major projects”, according to the work report.

Many analysts noted the GDP target was “ambitious” given the high base, lack of effective measures to turn around the faltering property sector and China’s increasing trade frictions with the United States and Europe.

“It is very likely that the announcements will disappoint the market,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist with Greater China at Standard Chartered.

“However, the government has reiterated several times that it will not launch a strong stimulus.”

Instead, the work report and the budget released by the National Development and Reform Commission on Tuesday signalled the government was doubling down on structural change, channelling more funds to the science and technology needed to make that wholesale economic transition.

“Beijing’s budget inclination on technology, education, national defence and agriculture is in line with its current moves to ward off external shocks and increase strategic investment,” Ding added.

As its top task this year, Beijing vowed to modernise industry and develop “new quality productive forces” at a faster pace, a reference to sectors that depend on advances in science and technology, from new-energy vehicles to biomanufacturing and commercial space flight.

Emerging from the opening ceremony, Science Minister Yin Hejun said he welcomed the 8.1 per cent increase in national investment in research and development last year and called for more funding to spur innovation by young researchers.

According to the budget report, the central government will increase R&D spending by 10 per cent to 370.8 billion yuan this year and promote national champions.

The allocations align with a push for self-reliance on fronts from chipmaking to artificial intelligence to counter tech containment from the West and to wrest technological supremacy from the US, according to analysts.

“Recent experience surrounding the trade war and tech war versus the US has exposed China’s vulnerability to technology ‘choke points’, supply chain disruptions and probably intelligence theft, which alarmed leaders,” said Tianchen Xu, from the Economist Intelligence Unit.

“For technology in particular, policymakers’ anxiety is probably aggravated by recent advancements in generative AI, which created concerns that China might lag behind further in cutting-edge technologies.”

Other elements of the work and budget reports – from expanding grain and energy reserves to creating more jobs and minimising risks from local government debt – reflect the leadership’s pursuit of stability, according to an economist from a leading university in Beijing.

“It suggests leaders are not very concerned with short-term economic problems. They are more troubled by longer-term challenges, posed by internal and external factors,” he said on condition of anonymity.

Huang Shouhong, director of the State Council Research Office, said the economic goals were realistic and achievable, though challenging.

“We have been going through all kinds of difficulties and gained rich experience [in managing the economy,” Huang said after the NPC opening.

“Our financial status is generally sound, with relatively large room to accommodate macro policies in the future.

“If unexpected events affect the economy, or unexpected changes happen to the international environment, there are reserved tools in our policy toolbox.”

Also in the work report, the government raised opposition to “external interference” in Taiwan, which will inaugurate independence-leaning William Lai Ching-te as president in May. The island has long been a source of tensions with the United States, which is Taiwan’s primary supplier of arms.

On Hong Kong, Li said the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” should be firmly enforced. Beijing would continue to support the economic development of Hong Kong and Macau, and develop the Greater Bay Area, he added.

On Tuesday, the Hang Seng Index experienced its biggest fall since January 17, dropping 2.6 per cent, whereas China’s CSI 300 Index, which replicates the performance of the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, edged up by 0.7 per cent."
Feb 26 2024,"In Anchorage forum, mayoral candidates discuss the economy and willingness to implement future sales tax",Alaska's News Source KTUU/KYES,center,https://alaskasnewssource.com/2024/02/27/anchorage-forum-mayoral-candidates-discuss-economy-willingness-implement-future-sales-tax,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Many of the questions at a mayoral forum hosted by the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce on Monday focused on how to strengthen the city’s economy.

In addition to Mayor Dave Bronson, seven of the nine candidates challenging Bronson on the April 2 ballot were on hand, including Bill Popp, Suzanne LaFrance, Chris Tuck, Breck Craig, Dustin Darden, Jenny Di Grappa and Phil Isley. Two other candidates, Nick Danger and Darin Colbry were not present.

Popp, the former head of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation, said focusing on workforce development would be a top priority. Popp said addressing many of the city’s issues depends on finding people to fill the jobs.

“Bottom line, without workers to fill the jobs, investment will not come here,” Popp said. “Companies are looking to invest in communities that have a growing and vibrant workforce with the skill sets that they need and right now we are going the opposite direction, losing 1 out of 10 working-age adults that we had just 10 years ago. It is the critical issue of our time.”

Popp said attracting and retaining a workforce that is grown locally should be the ultimate goal.

Former Anchorage Assembly Chair LaFrance agreed that outward migration, especially of working-age Alaskans, is a major issue for the city and state. She added that young people also need a reason to stay.

“It comes down to quality of life and affordability,” she said. “So we need to ensure that Anchorage is a place where people want to live, and again, it comes down to the basics, ensuring that the streets are plowed and that those services that everyone relies upon are provided.”

LaFrance said another key is having housing that young Alaskans can afford.

Former state representative Chris Tuck said education should be central to efforts to bolster the economy.

“From Pre-K all the way up through our university, job training and workforce development,” Tuck said. “Another key component of that is affordable, reliable energy. We need that infrastructure in place because businesses aren’t going to want to develop here or start here unless we have that reliable, affordable energy.”

Mayor Dave Bronson listed some specific accomplishments he’s made in office including forming an energy task force and efforts to increase the housing stock in Anchorage.

In response to a question about balancing economic development with Anchorage’s cultural heritage, the mayor said the two are not mutually exclusive. He said he is working on a plan to expand access to one of Anchorage’s cultural hubs.

“That’s why I’ve spent $25,000 on a feasibility study to bring the Alaska Native Heritage Center back to downtown or to downtown, where it always should have been,” Bronson said. “Our tourists who experience cultural tourism should not have to get on a bus and drive five or six miles to experience that.”

Bronson said the move would likely mean more tourist dollars flowing into downtown Anchorage.

Candidates were also asked about their positions on a possible sales tax. Some said the city isn’t doing the best job of spending the money it has now, including LaFrance.

“The first thing we have to do is do a better job of providing services for the money that the taxpayers are paying,” LaFrance said. “And we also need to think about what’s the best way to invest in ourselves and what will give us the best return.”

LaFrance didn’t say whether she favored a tax but Popp was more enthusiastic.

“A year-round sales tax with almost 20% of it being paid by people who don’t live in Anchorage is a tax break for the citizens,” Popp said. “And these are things that we should be having a long conversation about — at least a year’s worth — before we take it for a vote.”

Tuck was less direct. When questioned, he cited his legislative experience.

“We passed a fiscal plan, one of the first fiscal plans in state history,” he said. “One of the things we did was make sure we were efficient, and we managed cuts before we started asking people to pay for more.”

Tuck said, if needed, he would prefer a seasonal sales tax.

Mayor Bronson said the city had a spending problem it needed to get under control.

“Spending is the challenge,” Bronson said. “I could support a seasonal sales tax if it guaranteed a dollar-for-dollar reduction in property tax.”

On March 13, Alaska’s News Source will televise a debate at 7 p.m. between Bronson, Popp, LaFrance and Tuck.

Feb 25 2024,EPA finalizes air pollution standards that critics say will cost jobs and hurt the economy,Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/environment/epa-finalizes-air-pollution-standars-critics-say-will-cost-jobs-and,"The EPA finalized air pollution standards that create more stringent limits for soot exposure, as it is called. This despite a 42% decrease in the national average over the last 22 years, according to the agency’s own data.

“It’s going to hurt economies. It’s going to hurt manufacturing. It’s a real problem,” Daren Bakst, senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), told Just The News.

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA every five years to do a complete review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six common pollutants, which includes particulate matter.

The NAAQS for particulate matter, sometimes referred to as PM2.5, deal with solid particles and liquid droplets that are a fraction of the width of a human hair and are suspended in the air. These particles are emitted from construction sites, unpaved roads, agriculture fields, smokestacks and fires.

The new standards lowered the fine particulate matter from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. That means under the new standards, in one cubic foot of air, there can only be 0.00000026 grams of particulate matter.

According to the EPA, particulate matter can cause premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, decreased lung function, and respiratory problems.

The standards, the EPA argues, will help avoid 4,500 premature deaths, 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, and 290,000 lost workdays — all by 2032. This will save $22 billion to $46 billion in healthcare costs, and cost $590 million to implement.

“The most vulnerable among us are most at risk from exposure to particulate matter, and that’s why it’s so important we take a hard look at these standards that haven’t been updated in nine years,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan, in a statement announcing the initiation of the review.

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) disputed the EPA’s figures on cost of compliance. Citing a NAM-commissioned analysis by Oxford Economics, NAM argues the standards could reduce GDP by nearly $200 billion and cost as many as 1 million jobs through 2031.

According to the EPA, 119 counties are currently out of compliance with the standards, many of them in California.

NAM argues that as many as 200 counties will be out of compliance, and those that are marginally in compliance will have to reconsider investments in industry and jobs to avoid falling out of compliance.

A study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that the standards would put 386 to 569 counties out of compliance with the standards. “From requiring small businesses like restaurants to install costly equipment, homeowners to replace wood fireplaces with natural gas logs, and states to pave unpaved roads, this rule will impact many sectors of our economy,” the report stated.

As much as 30% of all counties in the U.S., the report says, would have to block permitting of manufacturing facilities and new infrastructure projects.

Writing on the CEI blog, Bakst explained that the rules were reviewed in 2020 after an extensive process involving input from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the EPA decided to keep the standards where they were.

Rather than stick to the five-year timeline set by Congress, right about the time Biden took office, the EPA decided to review the standards that the EPA had retained under the Trump administration.

“This grave mistake will drive investment away from the United States, derail permitting and weaken the economy for all,” Jay Timmons, CEO and president of NAM, said in a statement.

When asked about the potential economic consequences, which critics say will undermine the positive health outcomes of the rules, the EPA said in a statement to Just The News the standards were based on the “best available science and reflect input from the public as well as scientific experts.”

“Scientific evidence shows that long- and short-term exposures to PM2.5 can harm people’s health,” the EPA said in the statement.

This includes health impacts, the EPA said to ,”overburdened communities, including many communities of color and low-income communities throughout the United States.”

Prior to EPA announcing it was initiating a review of the standards, The Washington Post reported, EPA administrator Michael Regan dismissed 40 outside experts from advisory boards, including the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, who were researchers picked under the Trump administration. Critics had complained that the picks were weighted toward regulated industry and they took positions questioning the climate crisis.

The Biden administration, the Post reported, said the move would reestablish scientific integrity across the federal government.

Bakst argued the EPA filled the panel with members that would be more favorable to the administration’s agenda without regard to the scientific merits of their positions. “They got rid of every single person that provides advice on science. It’s got the appearance of gutting and putting your own people on so you can get the feedback you want,” Bakst said.

John Graham, who Trump had appointed to lead the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, told The New York Times that the dismissals were “very sad.”

“Now for the first time in the agency’s 50-year history, we have an administrator interested in scientific advice only from those scientists he has personally appointed,” Graham told the Times.

Bakst added that by pushing up the Congressionally mandated five-year timeline for the reviews, the EPA isn’t allowing for the time needed to do a careful, science-based review of the previous standards and what the economic consequences will be of the new standards.

“Americans are struggling. The economy is not flourishing, and the Biden administration is making things worse, as opposed to taking their time and thinking it through,” Bakst said."

Jan 03 2024,Economy — is 2024 going to be the year of the recession?,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/wex-mas-2024-year-recession,"In the spirit of the season, the Washington Examiner has identified 12 issues we believe will shape 2024 — and beyond. These close-up examinations of agenda-setting issues cover everything from the ongoing battle between the Biden family’s business deals and Republican Oversight, the emergence of a “new world order,” and fights over redistricting and new election maps. Part eight is about whether there might be a recession in 2024, a critical election year.

The United States avoided a recession in 2023, but the economy is still not out of the woods heading into a 2024 filled with uncertainties.

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to highs not seen since before the Great Recession. The Fed’s current rate target is 5.25% to 5.50%, a level designed to tamp down demand and thus inflation. Historically, though, rate-hiking cycles raise the risk of an economic downturn.



TWELVE DAYS OF WEX-MAS: DEMOCRATS REBRANDING CANDIDATES AS TOUGH ON CRIME AHEAD OF 2024 RACE



As the calendar flipped from 2022 to 2023, a large number of economists predicted that the U.S. would already be in the throes of a recession by now, but economic growth has instead continued at a robust clip.

As a rule of thumb, recessions are typically, though not always, marked by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product growth.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.9% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2023 — the strongest growth since the country’s pandemic rebound. GDP growth was 2.1% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the first quarter of last year. The Atlanta Fed’s “GDP Now” tracker predicts that GDP growth in the final quarter will be 2.3%.

But there is still much uncertainty for what lies ahead in 2024.

While the Fed has raised interest rates to high levels, it takes time for those rate hikes to filter through to the general economy. The majority of economists predict that some of that downward pressure will dampen economic growth heading into the new year and could even be enough to tip the U.S. into a recession, although most of those forecasting a recession expect it to be a mild one.

In a recent report, Wells Fargo economists point out that the Leading Economic Index, tracked in concert with the Conference Board, has declined for 20 consecutive months — a pattern that would indicate that a recession is imminent.

The economists note that the “historically reliable” indicator has been flashing a recession warning for some time.

“Yet despite the persistent warning signs from the LEI, economic growth has continued to strengthen,” the report reads. “The question as we turn to 2024 is will this period be classified as one in which the LEI cried wolf, or will we look back and cheer its steadfast signal at a time when broader economic conditions showed resiliency?”

Of note, the Fed is likely to begin cutting rates next year as inflation continues to meaningfully fall. Central bank officials are penciling in three rate cuts in 2024, although investors expect double the number of cuts.

Investors now see a nearly 83% probability that the Fed will cut rates in or before March, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which calculates the probability using futures contract prices for rates in the short-term market targeted by the Fed.

Investors are also pegging near-certain odds that the Fed will trim at least a full percentage point off of its target rate, with a high probability of even deeper cuts.

More rate cuts would bode well for the markets, although, perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether inflation, which has been trending down, unexpectedly rises again, forcing the Fed to hold rates higher for longer. That would not bode well for a soft landing.

Rodney Lake, vice dean for undergraduate programs at George Washington University and director of the university’s Investment Institute, told the Washington Examiner that he is in the soft-landing camp.

“I think there is likely to be a very soft landing and potential mild recession, but all economic indicators look very positive as far as unemployment, inflation easing, and companies’ overall fundamentals looking good,” Lake said.

And the labor market has remained strong despite the rate hikes, which began in earnest back in March 2022. The economy broke expectations again in November and added nearly 200,000 jobs. The unemployment rate also dropped slightly to 3.7%, right around where it was in the months before the pandemic.

A recession, meaning a downturn in output that also drives up unemployment, would be a major problem for President Joe Biden’s reelection efforts.

Biden has been getting very low marks on his handling of the economy, likely due in big part to the inflationary scourge that has torn through the country. While inflation has moderated, people are still paying much more for goods than they were when he took office.

Inflation has overshadowed the strong job market, but if there is a recession and people start ending up out of work, it would only increase the magnitude of voters’ anger over how the administration is handling the economy. The Republican nominee for president would invariably use a recession as a cudgel to attack Biden as the year inches closer to Election Day.

Still, as inflation keeps falling and with the expectation of interest rate cuts, more and more economists are expressing optimism that a recession can be avoided.

“High interest rates will remain a drag on consumer spending growth in the near term, although that drag has lessened somewhat as long-term rates have moved lower toward the end of 2023,” PNC chief economist Gus Faucher said. “Another constraint on spending growth will be the need for households to increase their saving. But overall, it looks like the U.S. economy is moving toward slower growth, but no recession, in 2024.”"

(KIFI) – Wyoming’s economy is growing and its future is bright, Governor Mark Gordon said in his 2024 State of the State speech.

Gordon said Wyoming’s GDP is the highest in history and unemployment is as low as it has been since 2008.

“Wyoming is open for business, constantly seeking to innovate and improve,” the governor said. “I can proudly say, Wyoming is on a roll.”

Given this is a Budget Session of the Legislature, Governor Gordon urged Legislators to focus on that key task and pass the budget he presented.

“I am confident the task at hand, setting the budget for the next two years, is serious enough that folks will keep their attention on meeting the needs of the people of Wyoming. This is not Washington — Wyoming folks are focused on solutions not politics,” Governor Gordon said.

He said his proposed budget takes on significant needs like property tax relief, targeting those truly in need. He also asked the Legislature to be mindful of the potential impacts to county resources, roads and schools when considering Legislation that addresses high property taxes."

Feb 02 2024,"Economy beats expectations again, adding 353,000 jobs in January",Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2024/02/02/january-jobs-report-335000-beats-expectations-soft-landing-economy,"The nation’s employers delivered a stunning burst of hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign of the economy’s continuing ability to shrug off the highest interest rates in two decades.

Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that last month’s job gain topped the 333,000 that were added in December, a figure that was itself revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, just above a half-century low.

The latest gains far exceeded expectations and showcased employers’ willingness to keep hiring to meet steady consumer spending. It comes as the intensifying presidential campaign is pivoting in no small part on views of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship. Public polls show widespread dissatisfaction largely because even though inflation has sharply slowed, most prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Some recent surveys, though, show public approval gradually improving.

This week, the Federal Reserve took note of the economy’s durability, with Chair Jerome Powell saying “the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong.” The Fed made clear that while it’s nearing a long-awaited shift toward cutting interest rates, it’s in no hurry to do so.

To fight inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times beginning in March 2022. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to boost unemployment and likely cause a recession. Yet the economy has managed to produce enough job growth to avoid a recession without accelerating inflation pressures. Inflation cooled throughout 2023, making it likelier that the Fed would achieve a “soft landing” — taming inflation without derailing the economy.

A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts. Yet measured against the nation’s vast labor force, the recent layoffs haven’t been significant enough to make a dent in the overall job market. Historically speaking, layoffs are still relatively low, hiring is still solid and the unemployment rate is still consistent with a healthy economy.

Consumers as a whole have proved more resilient than expected in the face of the Fed’s rate hikes. Having socked away savings during the pandemic, most were willing to spend it as the economy reopened. And a wave of early retirements, some of them related to COVID-19, limited the number of people available for work and contributed to a tight labor market.

The gradual improvement in public confidence has emerged in a series of recent surveys. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan has jumped in the past two months by the most since 1991. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans’ inflation expectations have reached their lowest point in nearly three years. And a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy good, up from 30% who said so late last year.

The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them —and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation."
Feb 02 2024,"Economy added booming 353K jobs in January, unemployment held at 3.7%.","""USA Today"" Contributor",left,https://usatoday.com/story/money/2024/02/02/jobs-report-january/72443647007,"Hiring picked up sharply in January as employers added a booming 353,000 jobs, highlighting a labor market that continues to defy high interest rates and household financial strains.

The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 185,000 jobs were added last month.

The surprisingly strong showing was driven by big payroll increases in health care and professional services but was also boosted by some quirky factors linked to holiday hiring that may not persist in the coming months.

Still, the performance wasn't a one-month blip. Job gains for November and December were revised up by a whopping 126,000, with the December tally upgraded to 333,000 from 216,000. The changes portray a stronger labor market in the fall than previously believed.

""The revision of last month’s numbers added to today’s report make clear the economy is breaking new ground,"" says Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the challenges facing U.S. workers and former head of the Labor Department’s employment and training division.

Are wages catching up to inflation?

Average hourly pay also rose sharply, climbing 19 cents to $34.55 and pushing up the yearly increase to 4.5% from an upwardly revised 4.3%. Since the spring of last year, pay increases have outpaced still-high inflation, giving consumers more purchasing power.

Is the Fed expected to cut rates?

The blockbuster job and wage gains could make the Federal Reserve warier about cutting interest rates anytime soon. The Fed tentatively plans to lower rates three times this year but said this week that a March cut is unlikely because officials want to ensure a pandemic-related inflation spike has been tamed for the long term.

""With blowout payrolls, a large upward revision, and a low unemployment rate, dreams of imminent Fed rate cuts are likely to be crushed by today's report,"" Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.

He doesn't expect the Fed to start reducing rates until the third quarter.

But other economists are still betting the central bank will act in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that a strong economy and job market can coexist with easing inflation and would not discourage officials from cutting as long as price increases continue to slow.

Since pay gains feed into inflation, January's rise in wage growth poses concerns. But the Fed will be focused mostly on whether inflation reports over the next few months show a continued slowdown, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic.

What sectors are adding the most jobs?

Last month, professional and business services led the job gains with 74,000. Health care added 70,000; retail, 45,000; social assistance, 30,000; and manufacturing, 23,000.

Federal, state and local governments added 36,000 jobs.

In recent months, industries that are less sensitive to rate increases and the economy’s ups and downs – such as government, health care, and social assistance – have accounted for the bulk of U.S. job growth lately. That pattern persisted to some extent last month but job gains were broader -- based on professional services and manufacturers hiring lots of workers.

How many hours a week do most Americans work?

One glaring weakness in the report: The average workweek fell from 34.3 hours to 34.1 hours, the lowest since the depths of the pandemic in March 2020. It's unusual for employers to be giving workers fewer hours at the same time they're adding lots of employees.

At least a partial answer is that companies are still smarting from severe pandemic-induced labor shortages over the past two years and are reluctant to let workers go even if their sales are flagging, Bostjancic says. They even may be adding some workers as they eye a pickup in demand down the road.

Since businesses have a surplus of employees, they're giving each fewer hours on average. That could signal slower hiring in the months ahead.

Yet economist Lydia Boussour of EY-Parthenon says unusually cold weather last month likely played a role in the reduced hours.

How does weather affect employment?

The January totals were expected to be skewed by some unusual crosscurrents.

Cold, snowy weather in the Northeast and Midwest likely dampened employment in industries such as construction and restaurants, Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note. That seemed to play out at least partly, with construction adding a modest 11,000 jobs and restaurants and bars trimming a few thousand.

A further decline was likely because unseasonably warm weather boosted employment in December, setting the stage for a pullback as temperatures returned closer to normal last month, Goldman said.

At the same time, retailers, hotels and trucking companies brought on fewer holiday workers than usual late last year, prompting fewer layoffs in January and lifting employment on a seasonally adjusted basis. That likely swelled payrolls by about 100,000, Goldman figured, more than offsetting the weather-related hit.

What is the hiring projection for 2024?

The bigger picture is that consumer spending and job growth are likely to slow substantially this year as lower- and middle-income households cope with high interest rates, record credit card debt, still-elevated inflation and dwindling pandemic savings.

Moody’s Analytics expects the U.S. to add an average of 72,000 jobs a month, down from 255,000 last year and 399,000 in 2022, as a post-pandemic burst in pent-up spending fades further.

Will there be layoffs in 2024?

Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have announced thousands of layoffs recently and some economists continue to predict a mild recession in 2024.

But most forecasters believe the nation will avoid a downturn. The same tech giants that are cutting workers in gaming and streaming are beefing up staffs for artificial intelligence and machine learning, says Ger Doyle, senior vice president of Experis, the tech hiring arm of staffing firm ManpowerGroup.

Former President Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican primary, defeating the state's former governor, Nikki Haley, NBC News projects. South Carolina's polls closed at 7 p.m. ET, and Trump's victory was projected by networks and wire services within minutes. ""This was a lot sooner than we anticipated,"" Trump said at a party in Columbia, South Carolina following the results. ""It's an early evening and fantastic one."" Trump's widely expected win further cements his status as the likely Republican nominee, though he still needs a total of 1,215 delegates to officially secure the nomination. Just after 10 p.m. ET, Trump was holding a statewide edge of more than 20 points over Haley, according to NBC News. Until then, Haley is determined to keep the GOP primary a two-person race. On Tuesday, Haley pledged to stay on the campaign trail through Super Tuesday on March 5, even if she lost her home state's Saturday primary. After losing to Trump on Saturday, Haley doubled down on that promise.

""I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for president,"" Haley said in Charleston, South Carolina, after Trump's projected victory. ""I'm a woman of my word."" She added that she would be campaigning in Michigan on Sunday and in various Super Tuesday states throughout the coming week. Haley's campaign confirmed that she has the funding to keep her afloat after a record fundraising month in January. ""We have the resources to go the distance,"" a spokesperson for Haley's campaign told CNBC on Tuesday. The former U.N. ambassador has yet to win a race this primary season, though she managed to pull out a slimmer loss against Trump in New Hampshire due to the state's wide population of undeclared voters. Going into Saturday's primary, South Carolina was much less undecided. Trump held a roughly 30-point lead against Haley, according to a February survey from USA Today and Suffolk University, disintegrating any hopes of her home-court advantage. Trump also had the endorsements of local South Carolina GOP chapters, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace and other lawmakers in the state. Trump also has a healthy track record in the Palmetto State, having won the GOP primary in 2016 and taking 55% of the votes in 2020 against Joe Biden. Where are the candidates on South Carolina's top issues? South Carolinians had immigration and the economy top of mind as they cast their ballots, mirroring sentiments nationwide. According to the February USA Today/Suffolk University poll, 42% of likely South Carolina GOP voters viewed immigration as the most important issue, while 26% prioritize the economy.

During a CNBC interview conducted Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon discussed the current U.S. economy and politics with the 2024 presidential election little more than nine months away.

He said that many Trump supporters are backing the former president because of his policies, not necessarily his personality.

""I wish the Democrats would think a little bit more carefully when they talk about MAGA,"" Dimon said on CNBC. ""When people say MAGA they're actually looking at people voting for Trump … and basically scapegoating them, that 'you are like him'

""I don't think they're voting for Trump because of his family values. Just take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, he was kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked, he was right about some of China. I don't like how he said things about Mexico. But he wasn't wrong about these critical issues. That's why they're voting for him.""

Dimon added that ""people should be more respectful of our fellow citizens"" and suggested to the CNBC hosts that they not just ask people whether they're supporting Trump, but also why.

""Not like it is a binary thing, you're supporting Trump or you're not supporting Trump,"" he said. ""Why [are] you supporting Trump?""

Without being asked about MAGA specifically, Dimon ripped Democrats for their attack on Trump's supporters and said President Joe Biden's anti-MAGA obsession will hurt his reelection chances.

""The Democrats have done a pretty good job with the 'deplorables,' hugging on to their Bibles and their beers and their guns,"" Dimon said. ""I mean, really? Can we just stop that stuff and grow up and treat other people with respect and listen to them a little bit.

""I think this negative talk about MAGA is going to hurt Biden's election campaign.""

Dimon said he remains cautious on the U.S. economy over the next two years because of a combination of financial and geopolitical risks, CNBC reported.

""You have all these very powerful forces that are going to be affecting us in '24 and '25,"" Dimon said.

LAHAINA, Hawaii – It's a perfect early morning at Kaanapali Beach in West Maui and a dawn voyage on an Ultimate Whale Watch tour is nearly full, with visitors eager to spot humpback whales.

""Alright everybody, good morning! I'm Captain Kristina and we also have Captain Sarah today. Welcome aboard,"" says Kristina Rau. She jokes that they'll have double the fun with two captains.

It's peak whale watching season, what Rau calls ""whale soup"" because they're popping up all over the place. As the co-captains review safety protocols, Sarah Hakan includes some new talking points that she's added since the wildfires last August.

""We experienced some great loss personally, so we want to keep the topic on whales today,"" she says. ""We are very grateful to be able to be out here with you guys and have some normalcy back in our lives."" She quickly pivots and asks the crowd, ""are you excited? Are you ready? I think there is a whale there!""

It was six months ago that deadly wildfires swept through Lahaina, killing 100 people and destroying the historic town, as well as homes in central Maui. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, officials discouraged all non-essential travel to West Maui, where Lahaina is located. And visitor arrivals for the whole island dropped precipitously – in August they were down almost 58% from August the previous year.

The recovery is slowly moving ahead, but tourism – the backbone of the economy for Lahaina as well as Maui – is still struggling to reboot in trying circumstances. West Maui opened to tourists in October and though hazardous debris removal has been underway since, cleanup of the ash just got started three weeks ago.

Lee James, owner of Ultimate Whale Watch in Lahaina, says he's happy to put captains Rau and Hakan and others back to work after being out of business for about four months. He needed time to repair his fleet: four of his five boats were damaged or destroyed in the fires, and he got his first boat back out on the water in December.

""When people come back to work, part of that weight is lifted, and then you get on the water, and it's just energizing, and then you can laugh again,"" says James. ""It's good to see that.""

Still, he's only operating two boats now and doing less than half the business he typically did before the fires. He's also employing far fewer people – down from 35 workers to between 16 - 20 depending on bookings.

James says he's trying to take things a day at a time.

""Six months ago you're like, 'are we going to be able to stay on the island?'"" he says. And still today, he checks in with his wife every so often, asking her if this is still where she wants to be. ""It's such a fluid and dynamic situation,"" he says. Things feel hard but the couple is committed to staying on Maui.

James' company is one of the more than 800 businesses that operated in the disaster area, providing work for about 7,000 people. Local advisors to Maui's mayor estimate about a third of that commerce is back in West Maui at the six-month mark, though the challenges are still profound.

""The stress right now in the community is we just can't go back to the way things were,"" says Sne Patel, president of the LahainaTown Action Committee. He also serves on Maui's Recovery Commission.

""People not only lost their businesses that day, but also many of them lost their homes,"" he says. ""Their employees lost their homes as well.""

Patel says commercial rents are going up because of the shortage of space, and some business owners can't afford to stay in West Maui. Many are relocating elsewhere on the island. With the trauma of the wildfires so fresh, and a lack of long-term housing in Lahaina, the workforce is unstable, he says.

""They're perhaps not even ready to go back [to work], considering they could have lost family,"" says Patel. Many people, he says, are struggling with their mental health. ""There's so many issues that arise from an event like this,"" he says.

Childcare and schools were disrupted, as multi-generational households have been spread out all over the island, leading to long commutes hampered by the added traffic of trucks removing debris from the burn zone.

Patel is worried about the future. In addition to his other roles, he's also the sales director at a resort rental company and anticipates a 30-40% drop in visitors to the Lahaina area as long as the region is rebuilding, which local officials say could take five years. Patel based his estimate on hotel and rental bookings through this summer.

""It's really that economic tsunami that's yet to really come.""

Because of the density of resorts and vacation rentals on this part of the island, he says as goes Lahaina, so goes Maui. For 2023, the number of visitors to the whole island was down 15% from the previous year, according to Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.

""You can't divorce the economic impact of the disaster in Lahaina and the impact on the whole island,"" says Patel.

The Maui Economic Development Board says about 70% of every dollar generated on Maui comes from tourism.

Patel says Maui is not in a position to walk away from the tourism-based economy, but more could be done to strike a balance for local workers.

""We give a five-star experience, I feel, to visitors in Hawaii, in Maui especially,"" Patel says. ""The return back to the community, for meeting some of their basic needs, hasn't been five-star.""

Locals say that lots of people come to Maui to get a nice experience they can take home, but don't bother to learn about this place in a deep way or invest anything besides tourism dollars.

Patel says the disaster presents an opportunity to change that dynamic.

""Right now is not the time for small changes,"" he says. ""It's the time for big, drastic changes that are going to be shifts for generations to come.""

He thinks Maui can be the model for that.

One model that you hear a lot of chatter about is something called ""regenerative tourism."" Here's how Maui Mayor Richard Bissen explains it to NPR.

""I think the mindset is more of being a guest rather than a tourist,"" Bissen says. ""Let me give you the difference. You folks live in your homes and you have friends that come to your home and they come over as guests and they treat your home a certain way or else you wouldn't let them in your home.""

Regenerative tourism would be less extractive and more sustainable, he says, with a focus on the rich culture, history, and environment here. For instance, tourists might volunteer to remove invasive species, reforest the landscape, or restore cultural artifacts.

Mayor Bissen says while discussions continue about Maui's long-term economic strategy, the recovery itself can help fuel the economy in the short-term.

""We're going to have a lot of construction work, just to rebuild what we lost,"" he says. Bissen's roots are deep on Maui as both of his parents were born here and he spent his formative years on the island.

""I'm not saying that's going to replace tourism. I'm just saying that's the reality: we will be building and rebuilding. And that should obviously bring money into the economy, provide jobs.""

The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) is trying to connect locals to those jobs. CEO Kuhio Lewis walks into a strip mall storefront that his group has converted into a classroom.

""Aloha, aloha,"" he's greeted by two men and two women who are there getting hazmat certifications.

People who lost their livelihoods to the fires can come here, at no cost, to get certified to work in the cleanup.

That might include getting a commercial truck drivers' license, or completing an occupational safety program required for jobs like clean up and debris removal at the Lahaina burn site.

Lewis says that when the fires hit, his organization sprang into action.

""This is a sense of kuleana,"" Lewis says, using the Hawaiian word for responsibility. ""That's just the familial ties and relationships that we share with each other as a Native people.""

He says CNHA has raised more than $20 million in private donations from around the world to support their fire relief efforts.

""The goal here is to provide Maui residents with the tools that they need to be part of their own solution,"" says Lewis. ""Rather than outside mainland corporations or workers coming to take these jobs.""

Lewis, who is 40, says stabilizing the economy is key to Maui's future.

And he, too, thinks the long-term solution is embracing regenerative tourism.

""It's about hearing the stories of this place, the history of this place, connecting to the land and the people,"" Lewis argues. He says that's especially true of a place like Lahaina – which has a rich history as the one-time capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. ""That's the Hawaii that I believe everybody fell in love with. But now it's become like Mai Tais in Waikiki.""

Lewis received a state government contract back in May — before the fires — to rethink what tourism could like for all of Hawaii. He's calling that project Kilohana, and its goal is ""to overhaul Hawai'i's approach to destination stewardship, visitor management, and marketing to better share our cultural heritage and values in a way that enriches the lives of residents and visitors.""

He says that as unfortunate as this disaster has been, it underscored the need to think about these issues. Especially at a time when locals are contemplating whether they'll stay on Maui.

""They're thinking about their quality of life,"" says Lewis. ""They are thinking about their future generations and it's still unclear as to what's going to happen, so you can't blame them if they want to move."""

Feb 14 2024,2024 NBA All-Star Game could bring millions to Indy's economy,Wish TV,center,https://wishtv.com/news/local-news/2024-nba-all-star-game-could-bring-millions-to-indys-economy,"2024 NBA All-Star Game could bring millions to Indy’s economy

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Businesses in and around Downtown are getting ready to welcome more than 100 thousand people for All-Star Weekend. With that comes a potential multi-million dollar impact on the local economy.

The NBA wants to let local shops and restaurants get in on the action with the help of its All-Star Rewards Program.

One of the participating businesses, Artisians, is a gift shop on Massachusettes Avenue. Owner Jennifer McDaniel says they’re looking forward to a busy weekend.

“You can just tell already, with just people getting ready — there’s just a buzz,” McDaniel said.

According to Pacers Sports and Entertainment Vice President of External Affairs Danny Lopez, the event can potentially bring a $320 million economic boost to the city.

“[It’s] a big deal for a market like ours,” Lopez said. “[We’re] really trying to tell more than a basketball story, but to talk about all the great things that we have here … all of the arts and culture that we’ve created over time, those are the stories that we’re going to tell.”

All-Star Rewards for Indy launched back in July 2023. McDaniel signed up her shop for the program a few months ago.

The foot traffic alone from major events does wonders for her business. She says the incentive could bring even more new shoppers along Mass. Ave.

“All of that’s really going to help give us you know, a little bit of exposure,” McDaniel said. “People go ‘Oh, my God, that’s a great place. I mean, I might buy online, too’ … You just don’t know what to expect. But we’re ready. We’re ready to go.”

In total, 400 locations are participating in rewards between shops, restaurants, and landmarks like the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in New Castle.

“It’s really cool,“ McDaniel said. “They can just scan the QR code and do virtual scratch-offs and earn points and prizes.”

According to Lopez, this year’s program is the biggest the NBA has put on. Meanwhile, more than 15,000 people have already signed up to get rewards."

The unemployment rate stayed the same at 3.7%. Unemployment remains low by historical standards.

The continued employment growth is good news for the White House, which has been working to credit President Joe Biden for the strong job creation over recent months, characterizing the underlying strength of the labor market and the broader economy as “Bidenomics” in action.

“It’s way better than expected. In fact, it’s so much better I’d call it incredible, as in maybe not entirely credible,” said Dan North, a senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the headline number might be revised down in the months ahead and that some seasonal distortions might be at play.

Friday’s report also showed the estimates for job creation in November and December being revised up by a combined 126,000. Job growth in recent months has been well above the rate needed to keep unemployment trending down over time.

Job growth was led by a 74,000 job increase in professional and business services. But the growth was broad-based, with payrolls growing in healthcare, retail, government, and manufacturing.

Wage growth was strong last month according to the report. Average hourly earnings increased by about double than what was anticipated, rising 0.6%. On an annual basis, wages popped 4.5%, above the 4.1% forecast.

In response to the strong labor market report, stock futures were down on Friday. That is because investors fear that stronger wage growth and jobs market tightness could mean that the Fed will hold interest rates higher for longer.

Both job creation and GDP growth have maintained momentum despite the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.

The Fed has carried out an at-times aggressive tightening cycle in response to the inflation that has roiled households over the past few years. Since the central bank began hiking in March 2022, annual inflation, as tracked by the consumer price index, has fallen from a peak of about 9% in June 2022 to just 3.4% in December.

The Fed announced a decision this week to keep its interest rate target steady, a move that led investors to push back the timeline for expected rate hikes to May.

There is also a growing perception that the labor market and economy more broadly will avoid the sort of painful recession some economists had predicted the country would already be enmeshed in right now.

The Fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4.1% by the end of this year. Officials also predict a very modest 1.4% GDP growth in 2024.

Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was down from the 4.9 percent rate in the third quarter but easily topped forecasters’ expectations and showed the resilience of the recovery from the pandemic’s economic upheaval.

The latest reading is preliminary and may be revised in the months ahead.

Forecasters entered 2023 expecting the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign of interest-rate increases to push the economy into reverse. Instead, growth accelerated: For the full year, measured from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, G.D.P. grew 3.1 percent, up from less than 1 percent the year before and faster than the average for the five years preceding the pandemic. (A different measure, based on average output over the full year, showed annual growth of 2.5 percent in 2023.)"
Jan 31 2024,We can still make a good economy much better,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/31/24055562/economy-bill-of-rights-vibecession-progressives-freedom-fdr,"After a confusing few months of surveys suggesting that Americans are unhappy with the economy despite positive signs like low unemployment and rising real wages, the vibes are now improving. Preliminary results from the University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiments found that in January, Americans’ regard for the economy reached its highest level in two and a half years.

Even low-income Americans are seeing some of the best labor market conditions in decades, with the rollback of an estimated 40 percent of the wage inequality that built up over the last 40 years. But that doesn’t mean we should abandon the main question raised by the mysterious “vibecession”: Why weren’t people happy about the economy?

Here are some other facts that even a very good economy cannot seem to wipe away: More than 6 million Americans are unemployed; 25.3 million Americans lacked health insurance in the first quarter of 2023 (which is actually a record low); and more than 650,000 Americans experienced homelessness in 2023. And more than 40 million Americans, or 12.4 percent of the population, lived in poverty in 2022, and that’s according to a poverty line that just about everyone agrees is ridiculously outdated and low. Not captured in those statistics are tens of millions of Americans who are living too close to economic deprivation for comfort.

I repeat: The economy is good, and full of things to celebrate. But a good economy and tight labor markets still won’t give us freedom from poverty, homelessness, or insecurity. To achieve those goals, progressives have long advocated for strong direct government action. “There’s this missing economic history around the very idea of freedom,” said economist Mark Paul, author of The Ends of Freedom: Reclaiming America’s Lost Promise of Economic Rights. “We’ve had this long struggle around fighting for economic security, or economic rights, here in the US.”

One way to understand what’s still wrong with the economy is to probe the history of one of its unrealized ambitions: an economic bill of rights.

President Roosevelt proposed an economic bill of rights in 1944

“The one supreme objective for the future … can be summed up in one word: security,” announced President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1944 state of the union address. “And that means not only physical security … It means also economic security.”

Roosevelt went on to propose a second bill of rights — this one economic — that would enshrine every American’s entitlement to the basics, such as housing, health care, education, and welfare. He’d already made big strides in that direction, however piecemeal, including the 1935 Social Security Act that created Social Security as well as unemployment and welfare benefits. But Roosevelt died in office just over a year after his 1944 speech, leaving his vision for an economic bill of rights unfulfilled.

Even before his death, however, Roosevelt had already withdrawn his support for reducing the work week, instead focusing on full-time employment for all with rising wages. That shift helped cement the framework we still use today to evaluate what makes a “good economy,” which boils down to improvements in the unemployment rate, wages, GDP, and inflation.

Decades after Roosevelt, the civil rights movement picked up the idea of economic rights. In a 1967 address, Martin Luther King Jr. described the bond between civil and economic rights. “No matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all poverty,” he said. The solution embraced by the movement was a 1966 proposal drafted by the activists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin: A “Freedom Budget” for All Americans.

The Freedom Budget was a revival of Roosevelt’s economic bill of rights, outlining seven core objectives that covered most of the same terrain, with additional emphasis on reducing pollution, to be achieved within 10 years. By the end of his life, such a program had become a core priority for King — his last written work before his assassination in 1968 was the posthumously published “We Need an Economic Bill of Rights.”

But the economy was already heading in a much different direction. The idea for an economic bill of rights faded as economic policy entered its neoliberal period in the 1970s. Rather than enshrining access to basic needs and economic rights for all, free markets and full-time employment were touted as the road to achieving economic security.

Now, half a century later, the economic consensus is shifting yet again.

Economic rights, today

From Oxford’s Institute for New Economic Thinking to the conservative think tank American Compass, a bipartisan slate of organizations have been announcing the end of neoliberalism for years now. But no one is really sure what comes next.

The president’s “Bidenomics” plans do suggest a new direction, embracing the pillars of public investment, empowering workers, and promoting competition. But a recent report from the progressive Roosevelt Institute argued that “these pillars will be insufficient to move us toward a truly progressive, post-neoliberal economy.” Securing that transition, it asserts, would benefit from “direct public provision” of goods and services, like health care, rather than relying on stimulating market mechanisms with tax credits. In addition, the authors call for more progressive taxation, and more democratic governance structures that can tilt the economy’s direction toward the public good.

Roosevelt’s vision of economic security for all could help bridge the gap between Bidenomics and progressive proposals. The idea has already been seeing a revival: When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced their Green New Deal in 2019, they included economic rights, stating that achieving the legislation’s goals would require providing all people of the United States with high-quality health care, a job guarantee, housing, economic security, clean water and air, and healthy and affordable food.

A few months later, Bernie Sanders invoked Roosevelt’s speech directly in one of his own, calling for a 21st-century economic bill of rights. “We must take the next step forward and guarantee every man, woman, and child in our country basic economic rights,” he said.

But the clearest articulation yet is in Mark Paul’s book, which, after naming what might be included in an economic bill of rights — including the rights to work, housing, education, health care, basic income and banking, and a healthy environment — devotes a chapter to each on the question of “How?”

The path to a fairer economy

Some of these goals could be implemented as a single policy. Medicare-for-all bills, which would effectively create a right to health care, are already plentiful thanks to being a spotlight issue in the 2020 Democratic primary. Basic income policies could also help establish the right to a guaranteed minimum income.

Other goals lack a single flagship policy. Paul explains that the right to a healthy environment, for example, depends on the trio of green investment, smart regulations, and carbon pricing. Or consider the task of guaranteeing housing for all, which Paul argues needs six separate policies. Of the six, he emphasizes a huge, green buildout of social housing — similar to what exists in Vienna, where social housing has created something of a “renters’ utopia” — and rent control.

“Progressives do not have the power — at least not yet — to win an economic bill of rights,” he concedes. “To see poverty eradicated, progressives will have to continue pressing their case — via mass movements and grassroots organizing, over the dinner table, and in the public sphere.”

But the history of the pursuit of economic rights suggests that what may look like bold progressive demands today are, in fact, quite old. And what’s more, they’re deeply rooted in what historian Eric Foner has called the “master narrative” of American history: freedom. “True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,” Roosevelt said in his 1944 address. “Necessitous men are not free men.”

Jan 26 2024,The U.S. economy grew at blistering 3.3% pace in Q4 while inflation pulled back,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/gdp-q4-2023-the-us-economy-grew-at-a-3point3percent-pace-in-the-fourth-quarter.html,"That compared with the Wall Street consensus estimate for a gain of 2% in the final three months of the year. The third quarter grew at a 4.9% pace.

Gross domestic product , a measure of all the goods and services produced, increased at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to data adjusted seasonally and for inflation.

The economy grew at a much more rapid pace than expected while inflation eased in the final three months of 2023, as the U.S. easily skirted a recession that many forecasters had thought was inevitable, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

In addition to the better than expected GDP move, there also was some progress on inflation.

Core prices for personal consumption expenditures, which the Federal Reserve prefers as a longer-term inflation measure, rose 2% for the period, while the headline rate was 1.7%.

On an annual basis, the PCE price index rose 2.7%, down from 5.9% a year ago, while the core figure excluding food and energy posted a 3.2% increase annually, compared with 5.1%.

The two components together added up to ""supersonic Goldilocks, because it's really a strong number yet inflation hasn't shown up,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""Everybody wanted to have fun. People bought new cars, a lot of recreation spending as well as taking trips. We've been expecting a soft landing for some time. This is just one step in that direction.""

The U.S. economy for all of 2023 accelerated at a 2.5% annualized pace, well ahead of the Wall Street outlook at the beginning of the year for few if any gains and better than the 1.9% increase in 2022.

As had been the case through the year, a strong pace of consumer spending helped drive the expansion. Personal consumption expenditures increased 2.8% for the quarter, down just slightly from the previous period.

State and local government spending also contributed, up 3.7%, as did a 2.5% increase in federal government expenditures. Gross private domestic investment rose 2.1%, another significant factor for the robust quarter.

The chain-weighted price index, which accounts for prices as well as changes in consumer behavior, increased 1.5% for the quarter, down sharply from 3.3% in the previous period and below the Wall Street estimate for a 2.5% acceleration.

""This year has been like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and the economy is knocking the blocks off the economists, always outperforming,"" said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""has got to have a smirk on his face this morning. Again, he's defying the economists' predictions with strong growth and inflation clearly coming under control.""

Markets showed only a modest reaction to the report. Stock futures gained slightly while Treasury yields moved lower. Futures markets continued to reflect the likelihood that the Fed will enact its first rate cut in May, though the CME Group's FedWatch gauge put the odds of a March cut at 47.4% around 10 a.m. ET.

""It was a great report, but you didn't see the market move much because GDP is backward-looking. It told us what happened in October and November and December,"" North said. ""It's great for historical patterns, but it doesn't really tell us much about where we're headed.""

In other economic news Thursday, initial jobless claims totaled 214,000, an increase of 25,000 from the previous week and ahead of the estimate for 199,000, according to the Labor Department. Continuing claims rose to 1.833 million, an increase of 27,000.

The GDP report wraps up a year in which most economists were almost certain the U.S. would enter at least a shallow recession. Even the Fed had predicted a mild contraction due to banking industry stress last March.

However, a resilient consumer and a powerful labor market helped propel the economy through the year, which also featured an ongoing pullback in manufacturing and a Fed that kept raising interest rates in its battle to bring down inflation.

As the calendar turns a page to a new year, hopes have shifted away from a recession as markets anticipate the Fed will start cutting rates while inflation continues to drift back to its 2% goal.

Concerns remain, however, that the economy faces more challenges ahead.

Some of the worries center around the lagged effects of monetary policy, specifically the 11 interest rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points that the Fed approved between March 2022 and July 2023. Conventional economic wisdom is that it can take as long as two years for such policy tightening to make its way through the system, so that could contribute to slowness ahead.

Other angst centers around how long consumers can keep spending as savings dwindle and high-interest debt loads accrue. Finally, there's the nature of what is driving the boom beyond the consumer: Government deficit spending has been a significant contributor to growth, with the total federal IOU at $34 trillion and counting. The budget deficit has totaled more than half a trillion dollars for the first three months of fiscal 2024.

There also are political worries as the U.S. enters the heart of the presidential election campaign, and geopolitical fears with violence in the Middle East and the continuing bloody Ukraine war.

Correction: The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 2.7% on an annual basis, down from 5.9% a year ago. An earlier version mischaracterized the figures.

Dec 28 2023,It’s okay to be optimistic about the economy next year,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/24008366/economy-predictions-2024-recession-inflation-growth-jobs,"I’m going to throw out a wild idea here: What if the economy is good in 2024? I know, I know, prices are still too high. Everybody hates everything so much that we’ve coined the term “vibecession.” The pandemic fallout is still reverberating. But hear me out — maybe it would be neat to head into the new year without all the doom and gloom.

There is a case for hope here. I mean, look at what happened in 2023. We came into the year with the lowest of expectations. Tons of economists, including some big names, thought a major downturn was inevitable in the United States. Many people were sure the Federal Reserve’s fight to get inflation down would mean a significant spike in unemployment; the logic was preordained. In fall 2022, Bloomberg ran a headline forecasting a 100 percent chance of a recession within a year.

As it turns out, there’s never a 100 percent chance of anything. That surefire 2023 recession never came. Despite the negative sentiment around the economy — sentiment that mayyybe is starting to turn around — things this year were really good. Inflation came down. The jobs market stayed strong. Consumers, in aggregate, kept spending. The US economy grew at a surprisingly strong rate. After a tough 2022, stock market investors had a solid time.

“2023 wasn’t supposed to happen,” said Claudia Sahm, the founder of Sahm Consulting and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. “For inflation to come down that much, unemployment’s been below 4 percent for the longest stretch since the 1960s, and growth — inflation-adjusted consumer spending is just knocking it out of the park.”

There definitely are worse ways to head into 2024.

Come over here, let me tell you a nice little story about next year

The US economy is not out of the woods. We haven’t yet reached that coveted “soft landing,” where inflation gets back to the Fed’s 2 percent target without tipping the economy into recession. That outcome does seem possible — I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but there’s some room for optimism.

The stock market is feeling really excited about the year ahead — arguably, maybe a little too excited

Predictions obviously can be wrong — again, see 2023 — but many economists feel quite positive looking ahead. Goldman Sachs sees just 15 percent odds of a recession over the next 12 months and thinks the economy is on its “final descent” to a soft landing. Bank of America is making a similar call. The Fed likes what it’s seeing and is hoping for more of it in 2024. It’s anticipating three interest rate cuts next year.

“It should be a good year. Probably not as good as 2023,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. (Seriously, by most traditional economic measures, the 2023 economy was very good.) He pointed out that he wasn’t among the group expecting a recession this past year — when you’re on the right side of a bet, you may as well enjoy it — but that even he wasn’t anticipating this. “The big surprise was the supply side of the economy. Productivity growth revived and labor force growth surged, so that allowed the economy to grow a lot more and still get inflation back in the bottle.”

Inflation is on track to continue to cool. That doesn’t mean prices will go back to where they were in 2019, though they may decline in some areas. If the labor market stays robust, wages should keep rising, too, and at a pace faster than inflation.

“Wage growth for all income groups is stronger than the rate of inflation, so people’s real purchasing power should improve. They should feel a lot better about the buying power of their income a year from now than they do today,” Zandi said. The relief will be most welcome for low-income households, he added, which are under the most pressure right now.

Even though the Fed hasn’t cut interest rates yet, they’ve started to fall in some areas in anticipation of what’s ahead. Mortgage rates are back under 7 percent, which has inspired some hopefulness around the housing market. The stock market is feeling excited about the year ahead — arguably, maybe a little too excited.

After the Fed’s latest interest rate decision and Fed Chair Jay Powell’s news conference, “markets got a little giddy,” Sahm said. In the subsequent days, some Fed members tried to temper some of that giddiness, to limited effect, as investors remain pretty amped.

This nice little story has to come with some buts

Nothing is guaranteed in life, and certainly not a good economy. Even if the US avoids recession in 2024, someday, there will almost certainly be a recession. It’s just the way the business cycle goes. There are plenty of risks that could put a recession on next year’s agenda.

Some economists still think a downturn is likelier than not. Andrew Patterson, senior international economist at Vanguard, has a base case that the US and other developed markets will see mild recessions likely in 2024. Even if the US economy doesn’t turn completely negative, he anticipates some job loss. “Fed policy [needs to] bring inflation fully back down to 2 percent, and we believe that is going to require some labor market loosening,” he said. “That’s going to come with some pain.”

Larry Summers, former treasury secretary and one of the pre-2023 doomsayers, told the Financial Times that it’s “premature” to call this a soft landing, given where inflation is. “We may soft land on the aircraft carrier, but the landing may be hard, and we may overfly,” he said.

The main risk for 2024 is the Fed. It might keep interest rates too high for too long, pushing the economy under, or it could cut them too early, allowing inflation to take off again and necessitating even harsher hikes later. It could confuse markets with its decisions. “They’re threading a difficult needle,” Zandi said. “I think the odds of a mistake are certainly receding, but we’re not across the finish line.”

“Definitely by this time next year, we’re either landed, or we’re in a recession”

There could be dangers lurking elsewhere that observers don’t see yet, such as an issue in the banking system. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse earlier this year, which was related to the Fed’s interest rate hikes, felt like it came out of nowhere, even though it didn’t. If the past few years have taught us anything, the economy can also take big hits from really uncontrollable forces, like the pandemic and Russia’s Ukraine war. A sudden change in oil prices is always a possible risk, too. “Nothing does more damage to the economy than higher oil prices very quickly,” Zandi said.

There is also the fact that inflation coming back down without a recession would be a unique scenario. For inflation to come down fully to 2 percent while maintaining a strong labor market and avoiding broader macroeconomic weakness would be quite unprecedented, Patterson said. “It’s not out of the realm of possibility,” he added. “It’s not our base case by any means. But it is also something that we’re keeping an eye on.”

Honestly, maybe we just kind of need a hopeful nice story sometimes

The US economy is far from perfect. Increases in the cost of living are painful, and even before this latest bout of inflation, things were far from great. Higher interest rates to fight inflation have made things worse. There’s no denying that people say they do not feel good about the state of affairs, macroeconomically speaking, even if their spending says otherwise, and many admit that, personally, they’re doing okay. We’re in a weird and far-from-ideal economic scenario.

Still, it might be nice to at least try to be modestly optimistic. If objectively good things keep happening for long enough, maybe people will start to feel it more, too.

In 2023, we sort of turned a corner on inflation. Turning that corner took too long, but it happened, nonetheless. “I understand why people are angry. I’m just happy that more people have paychecks, the paychecks are bigger, and they’re out there spending,” Sahm said. She thinks that by the middle of next year, we should know whether we’ve gotten a soft landing or not. “Definitely by this time next year, we’re either landed, or we’re in a recession,” she said. Let’s all aim for the former."
Jan 12 2024,Biden Looks To Boost Economy With $132 Billion In Student Loan Relief,Forbes,center,https://forbes.com/sites/georgeschultze/2024/01/12/biden-looks-to-boost-economy-with-132-billion-in-student-loan-relief,Failed to retrieve text: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://forbes.com/sites/georgeschultze/2024/01/12/biden-looks-to-boost-economy-with-132-billion-in-student-loan-relief on URL https://forbes.com/sites/georgeschultze/2024/01/12/biden-looks-to-boost-economy-with-132-billion-in-student-loan-relief
Feb 06 2024,"Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro proposes $48 billion budget with focus on education, economy, and people – Pennsylvania Capital-Star",Pennsylvania Capital-Star,right,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pennsylvania-gov-shapiro-proposes-48-billion-budget-with-focus-on-education-economy-and-people,"Gov. Josh Shapiro said he wants to invest in the people of Pennsylvania with a $48.3 billion budget that directs new funding to education, economic growth, and creating better opportunities for residents.

“We need to build a more competitive Pennsylvania that starts in our classrooms, runs through our union halls and small businesses, through our farmlands and our high rises, our college campuses, and leads to a life of opportunity and a retirement with dignity,” Shapiro said during his budget address Tuesday in the state Capitol rotunda – the first time a governor has given an address there in the building’s nearly 120-year history.

Shapiro spoke about the successes of his first year in office, which ended with an upgrade in Pennsylvania’s bond rating and a $14 billion surplus. In his second year, Shapiro said he believes it is time to invest some of the surplus “squirreled away in Harrisburg.”

“Look, it is not a badge of honor, nor is it something to be politically proud of for some lawmakers out there to say: I took more money from the good people of Pennsylvania than I needed and then bragged about how I just kept it in some bank account here in the Capitol,” Shapiro said, in a rebuke to lawmakers who argue the commonwealth should safeguard its reserves.

Shapiro noted that even if every one of the proposals in his budget passes, the state would still have an $11 billion surplus at the end of June 2025.

The spending proposal includes a response to the state court ruling last year that Pennsylvania’s K-12 education funding system is unconstitutional by providing more than $1 billion in new funding for public schools.

Shapiro’s budget builds on a 2022 campaign pledge to provide career pathways for young adults with a plan to overhaul the commonwealth’s public university and community college system, with a 15% increase in funding for state-owned universities and a 5% increase for the state’s four land grant universities.

It proposes more than $500 million in investments in the state’s first economic development strategy in more than 20 years while continuing a phased reduction in corporate income taxes, speeding state permitting to “work at the speed of business,” and redirecting more than $283 million in state sales tax to avoid public transit fare hikes and service cuts.

Republican leaders responded with criticism that the plan is unrealistic and does little to improve the state’s economic prospects.

“Today, we heard not a moderate Gov. Shapiro,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said after Shapiro’s address. “But obviously a very liberal-minded Gov. Shapiro.”

Ward expressed concern that Shapiro’s plan didn’t address state regulations that she said caused Pennsylvania to lose business, jobs and population to other states. Ward also called the plan a “budget of unicorns and rainbows.”

“We will dig into this budget, we will look at it hard, we will try to find out where he’s coming up with the money to pay for this,” Ward said. “In addition to just raiding the rainy day fund, where is this money coming from?”

‘The future of the commonwealth’

House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said she is confident that much of Shapiro’s proposal would become a reality as lawmakers and stakeholders negotiate in the coming months.

“No longer will we wait to invest in the future of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, because the future starts right now, today,” McClinton said.

House Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said Pennsylvania can’t afford another year without raising the minimum wage, without fixing toxic and crumbling schools, or without making college affordable.

“You’re going to hear people talk about how much this costs. But look, the cost is too great for us not to do it,” Harris said, adding “ … We can’t afford another year of disinvestment in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

But House Minority Leader Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) described the budget as a “phishing scam” that claims to offer a fix for education and mass transit while keeping taxes low and making Pennsylvania more competitive.

“With a proposal like this, I can see why at first blush that many Pennsylvanians would want to buy in,” Cutler said, adding, “ … just because it looks good, you shouldn’t click the link because it could lead to ruin.”

In his address, Shapiro prodded lawmakers to move this year on initiatives that have languished in the Pennsylvania Legislature as neighboring states have acted decisively.

Shapiro called on lawmakers to raise Pennsylvania’s minimum wage from $7.25, where it has been since 2009, to $15 an hour to keep pace with each of its neighbors.

“We are falling behind, it’s anticompetitive, and it’s hurting our workers,” Shapiro said. “We have seen proof that Pennsylvania workers living in border counties would rather drive into another state for work so they can earn a higher wage than take a job at home in Pennsylvania.”

The governor’s budget calls for tapping a new revenue source by legalizing and taxing the recreational use of cannabis by adults, which all of Pennsylvania’s neighbors — save West Virginia — have already done. Administration officials said revenue from legal marijuana is projected to reach $250 million annually in five years.

Shapiro said that in addition to ensuring that the new industry is regulated and taxed, legislation should create jobs and build wealth in the communities that have been disproportionately impacted by criminalization of marijuana. It should also provide for the expungement of criminal records for people convicted of nonviolent possession of small amounts of marijuana, he said.

Not mentioned in Shapiro’s address but included in the budget is a plan to regulate and tax slot machine-like skill games, which have proliferated in a legal gray area outside the authority of the state’s Gaming Control Board. Administration officials estimate it would generate $150.4 million in the first year.

“While I expect you will carefully analyze my proposals and seek your own in the final budget, your analysis shouldn’t be used as an excuse for paralysis,” Shapiro said. “It’s time to solve these pressing problems, to meet this moment responsibly and with bipartisan compromise.”

Education funding

The February 2023 Commonwealth Court decision declaring Pennsylvania’s education funding system unconstitutional provided the overarching narrative for much of Shapiro’s first year in office.

By choosing to forego an appeal in the state Supreme Court, legislative leaders accepted the court’s mandate to change the system, Shapiro said Tuesday. He called on lawmakers to build on the commitment to students and teachers they have already shown by approving money for building repairs, in-school mental health services and free school breakfast.

Shapiro’s proposal would adopt the recommendation of the bipartisan Basic Education Funding Commission to bring each of Pennsylvania’s school districts up to an adequate funding level based on the expenditures of its most successful districts.

It would provide $872 million in the first installment to close the $5.4 billion gap over the next seven years. In addition, school districts would receive an additional $200 million in basic education funding through the state’s fair funding formula and reset the base amount each school district receives at 2023-24 levels so that no district sees a cut.

The proposal also follows the commission’s recommendation to spend $300 million a year over the next five years to repair school buildings.

Shapiro called on lawmakers to update what he called an antiquated charter school law that forces school districts to overpay for charter school tuition. He noted that when Pennsylvania first allowed charter schools in 1997, online charter schools were almost unheard of. Today, nearly 60,000 students attend cyber charter schools..

The charter school law provides the same funding to online charter schools as it does to brick-and-mortar charters. That amount varies widely from one school district to another. By setting a statewide charter school tuition at $8,000, school districts would save $262 million a year, Shapiro said.

“If you combine those savings with the new money I’m proposing for 500 school districts, that would mean nearly $2 billion more for public schools next year,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro said it’s also incumbent upon the state to make sure students have the freedom to chart their own course and determine their next steps after graduating from school.

“If you’re in the 10th or 11th grade and you’re excited about being a welder or a plumber, we should celebrate that and we should treat that career path with the same level of respect to someone who chooses to go to college,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro said his budget would build on record investments in vocational and technical schools and trade apprenticeships by establishing a program to connect young workers with skills to thousands of employers who need them.

And for those who choose college, Shapiro said his budget would improve access by capping state university and community college tuition at $1,000 per semester and increase state grants for private university students to nearly $7,000 a year.

In his first budget address last year, Shapiro said Pennsylvania’s higher education system was broken. On Tuesday, he outlined a plan to unite the 10 state-owned universities with the state’s 15 community colleges while preserving local leadership. The budget would provide $975 million in new funding for the combined public university and college system.

“Together our public colleges and universities will create pathways to affordable credentials and degrees while opening up the doors of opportunity and meeting the Commonwealth’s workforce needs,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro’s proposal would also change the way Pennsylvania’s state-related universities – the University of Pittsburgh, and Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities – are funded to make state appropriations performance-based rather than writing a blank check.

‘…sick and tired of losing to friggin Ohio’

While Shapiro touted his administration’s wins in attracting new industry and its work to improve the business environment, he said Pennsylvania is still outspent by neighbors in its economic development efforts.

“Let’s be frank. Their investment is paying off and I am sick and tired of losing to friggin Ohio. We need to catch up right now,” Shapiro said.

At the core of Shapiro’s economic development strategy is a $500 million bond issue to make industrial sites ready for business by obtaining permits and installing utilities.

Economic growth should not be solely focused on city high rises and suburban office parks, Shapiro said, noting that 600,000 Pennsylvania residents work in agriculture on 53,000 farms that contribute $132 billion to the state’s economy.

“To ignore that is not only disrespectful to our farmers, it doesn’t make sense economically. In the same sentence when we talk about life sciences, manufacturing, robotics, we should be talking about investing in our farms and in our farmers,” Shapiro said.

To that end, the proposed budget includes investments to help farmers upgrade their equipment and to promote animal health and disease prevention by funding a new state animal testing laboratory in western Pennsylvania.

Speaking about human services, Shapiro told the story of a 60-year-old single mother who cares for her adult son who requires 24/7 care. Although funding has been available for in-home care, many families who need such services have been unable to obtain them because too few people are willing to do the job for the wages offered by the state.

“I’ve listened to those families. I’ve seen the exhaustion and the desperation in the eyes of parents and caregivers who are doing everything right. But they still can’t get their kids the services they need. It’s heartbreaking,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro’s budget would provide $216 million that would allow the state to draw down another $266 million in federal money to allow community based service providers to pay higher wages to in-home care providers.

In another anecdote,Shapiro recalled Nicolas Elizalde, a 14-year-old student killed in an ambush shooting after a football game at Roxborough High School in Philadelphia. His mother Meredith, who was in the audience Tuesday, has been a vocal advocate for gun safety laws, Shapiro said.

“With gun violence at unacceptable levels in our communities, it is long past time for us to take real action,” Shapiro said.

His budget proposal includes $75 million in new funding for gun violence intervention, prevention, investigation, and prosecution. It would also provide $30 million in school- and community-based gun prevention, security for nonprofit institutions such as synagogues and churches, and create the Office of Gun Violence within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency.

But Shapiro called on lawmakers to do more, noting that many “talk a big game on law and order,” yet allow loopholes in background check requirements to go unclosed.

In closing, Shapiro pointed to the lavish murals that adorn the walls of the Capitol rotunda, saying that their images of Pennsylvania history give him hope for the commonwealth.

“When I walk these halls, and I see these depictions of our past, I can’t help but feel optimistic about our future, a future we will build together staying true to the words and the creed of William Penn as we work to do what is truly wise and just.”

Jan 12 2024,Biden touts the economy in return trip to Lehigh Valley with big election ahead,Lehigh Valley Live,left,https://lehighvalleylive.com/lehigh-county/2024/01/biden-touts-the-economy-in-return-trip-to-lehigh-valley-with-big-election-ahead-photos.html,"In his second trip to the political battleground region since taking office, President Joe Biden visited the Lehigh Valley on Friday afternoon to tour a handful of small businesses and tout a message of an American economy on an upswing as he vies for a second term.

The Democrat stopped in three stores along Main Street in Emmaus, greeting business owners, employees, and residents — many cheering, some jeering — and later appeared at the new fire training academy in Allentown that was built using federal stimulus funds.

Biden, who was born and spent his early years ago 80 miles away in Scranton, told reporters the goal of his visit was to “make sure what we’re doing” on the economy — what his administration calls “Bidenomics” — is “making some sense” and “affecting people’s attitudes.”

“Starting a new business is an act of hope,” Biden said at the Allentown Fire Training Academy. “And a lot of people came out of the last several years kind of down.”

“I just came away from this really reassured that what we’ve done has had an impact. Not just here in Pennsylvania but throughout the country.”

The economy is a topic of close scrutiny for Biden. Opponents frequently attack him for his handling of it, and polls show many Americans are dissatisfied. Supporters say he doesn’t get enough credit as unemployment and inflation numbers have improved in recent months.

The White House also stressed Friday a record 16 million new business applications have been filed in the U.S. over the last three years.

Biden last visited the Valley when he appeared at the Mack Trucks plant in Lower Macungie in July 2021 to promote manufacturing.

His return Friday comes as Pennsylvania, a swing state, could play a big role in November’s election, and the Valley in particular is a critical area. Biden defeated Trump in the state in 2020, winning 53% of the Valley’s vote.

Polls so far show Biden and Trump close in a potential 2024 rematch, including in Pennsylvania. A Jan. 10 Quinnipiac University survey found the state is a dead heat between them.

Among the stores Biden visited in Emmaus was Nowhere Coffee Company, which began in 2021 with the help of federal small business loans and now has two locations in the area.

“Anybody want a coffee? It’s on me,” Biden said, according to the press pool report.

The president ordered a smoothie for himself and took selfies and chatted while he waited for the drink. He paid cash for it.

“By the way, we’re almost in heaven,” Biden said as he left the store. “We’re almost in Scranton.”

Before that, Biden stopped at South Mountain Cycle, a bike shop in the same building. It’s owned by Borough Councilman Chad Balliet and wife Heather Balliet. Also on the tour was Emmaus Run Inn, a running store.

“When are you opening a store in Delaware?” Biden asked the owners in reference to the state where he’s lived for years after his family left Pennsylvania.

He also pointed to the press and joked: “Would you give them running shoes so they can take off?”

Sean Linehan, one of the shop’s owners, said Biden was “extremely personable,” speaking to staff and some customers about his initiatives and “how the strength and hope of our economy starts with small businesses like ours.”

“The White House advance team told us that initially it was going to be in Allentown, but they thought Emmaus had a nice small-town feel,” Linehan told lehighvalleylive.com.

Biden later traveled to the Mack Southside Fire Station in Allentown, home of the fire academy that opened in August with $2.3 million in American Rescue Plan funds.

There, the president told reporters business owners Friday relayed to him they’re still worried about their pocketbooks. But he noted the owners of the coffee shop said they have “started to gain faith” after seeing their business grow.

Asked about polls showing many Americans still have a sour view of the economy under his presidency, Biden said: “If you notice, they’re feeling much better about how the economy is doing. What we haven’t done is letting them know exactly who got it changed.”

But Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel released a statement Friday countering that view.

“With out of control crime and heartbreaking job cuts, Allentown is another unfortunate victim of Democrat control,” McDaniel said. “Today, Biden will have to face the very people his policies hurt. In November, small business owners, like ones he meets today, will vote for economic relief and safety in our Republican nominee.”

Republican state Sen. Jarrett Coleman, who represents part of Lehigh County, including a section of Allentown, was also dismissive.

“Bidenomics? Does anyone think that’s working? The thing about a healthy economy is that if we had one, the President wouldn’t have to convince people to get excited about it,” Coleman said in a statement. “Many of my constituents are struggling to make ends meet due to inflation.”

Dressed in a black coat and his trademark aviator sunglasses, Biden arrived at Lehigh Valley International Airport shortly after 1 p.m. aboard Air Force One.

He was greeted on the tarmac at their airport by several top Pennsylvania officials, all fellow Democrats: Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, U.S. Rep. Susan Wild of the Lehigh Valley, and Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk. Casey and Wild also are running for another term this year.

In Emmaus, a throng of about 100 people stretched along Main Street behind barricades to catch a glimpse of the president as he arrived in town. Someone handed out American flags. One man held a different flag: It compared Biden to a donkey. Hundreds more people mulled about sidewalks in town.

When Biden arrived via motorcade, a handful of supporters of former President Donald Trump — Biden’s one-time and possibly future rival — yelled “Let’s go Brandon!” or “F**k Joe Biden!” Onlookers sitting on the deck of a house near the bike shop shouted at Biden: “Go home, Joe!” and “You’re a loser!”

There were plenty of Biden backers, too. And because Emmaus High School was released early Friday, there were pockets of high schoolers lingering.

One man on the porch of his business told a portion of the crowd: “Thank you all for coming to see me. Happy New Year!” Laughs ensued.

The presidential motorcade later took Biden to the Allentown Fire Academy, where dozens of pro-Palestine protestors lined the street chanting “Peace right now!” and “We will remember in November!” as the war between Hamas and Israel continues in the Middle East. There was a large police presence, with officers carrying shields.

After the Allentown stop, the motorcade traveled along Interstate 78 and Route 22, closed to other traffic, before arriving back at Lehigh Valley airport at 5:37 p.m., with Biden ascending the steps for takeoff en route to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the press pool reported.

This was Biden’s second trip to Pennsylvania in a week, after he delivered a speech in Blue Bell last Friday. There, he painted Trump as a threat to democracy for his efforts to overturn and cast doubts on the 2020 presidential election.

He is also scheduled to visit Philadelphia on Monday for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service event, the White House said.

Friday’s trip comes as more than 70 Valley businesses closed last year. Several told lehighvalleylive.com they continued to face post-pandemic challenges and staffing shortages and expressed frustration by growing inflation costs.

But inflation in the U.S. has cooled more or less, falling to 3.4% after from a high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Meanwhile, the nation’s unemployment rate in November was 3.7%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from October.

Unemployment remains at a historic low in Pennsylvania, the state Department of Labor and Industry said in December. Adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the statewide rate was unchanged in November, remaining at the record low of 3.4% from October.

The Lehigh Valley’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in November was at a 20-year-low of 3.9%, according to the department, representing the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area that covers Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton and Warren counties.

The Valley also just celebrated a record gross domestic product of $50.2 billion in 2022, with manufacturing representing its biggest sector, according to the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. That GDP ranks 68th among the nation’s metro regions, with 12,100 jobs added over the last five years and 15,000-plus companies calling the Lehigh Valley home, the LVEDC said.

Among the area’s iconic brands are Mack Trucks, Martin Guitar, Olympus, Crayola, Air Products, B. Braun Medical, Lutron, and Just Born, maker of marshmallow Peeps and other candies.

Jan 05 2024,"US economy adds 216,000 jobs in December, beating expectations",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-december-2023,"The labor market ended 2023 on solid footing as job growth continued to chug along at a healthy pace in December.

Employers added 216,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, topping the 170,000 gain forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.

The report also contained sizable downward revisions to job growth during the previous two months. Gains for October and November were revised down by a total of 71,000 jobs to a respective 105,000 and 173,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is weaker than it previously appeared.

In total, the economy added about 2.7 million jobs over the course of 2023, down from 4.8 million in 2022.

AMERICANS IN THESE STATES ARE GETTING A PAY RAISE THIS YEAR

""The labor market and economy have normalized and are in a healthy place — not too hot, not too cold,"" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group.

In another show of strength for the economy, average hourly earnings — a key measure of inflation — increased 0.4% for the month and remained up 4.1% from the same time one year ago. Both of those figures came in slightly ahead of expectations.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally cooling after nearly two years of interest rate hikes. Policymakers voted last month to leave their benchmark rate unchanged for a third straight time and hinted they could soon begin cutting rates amid signs the economy is gradually slowing.

Stocks fell after the surprisingly strong jobs data diminished the odds of aggressive Fed rate cuts. Pricing suggests the odds of a March rate cut fell precipitously on Friday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

The payroll number ""probably disappointed bulls who have been riding expectations that a soft labor market will speed up rate cuts,"" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley. ""Data like this may pump the brakes a bit. For now, the name of the game is patience. Rate cuts are still on the table, but investors will probably have to wait until the second half of the year.""

Larkin added, ""And the Fed has made clear it’s prepared to go the other direction if it thinks inflation is on the rise again.""

Fed officials are slated to hold their next policy-setting meeting at the end of January.

Job gains were mostly concentrated in a handful of sectors last month, with the biggest gains in government (52,000), leisure and hospitality (40,000) and health care (37,700). Hiring in construction also trended upward.

Those gains helped to offset job losses in transportation and warehousing, the result of a steep drop in the number of couriers and messengers.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown. However, there are some signs that cracks are beginning to appear after last year's blistering pace of growth.

""Don’t be fooled by the strong job report for December,"" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. ""The cooling trend in the labor market continues. Following a period of vigorous hiring after the pandemic, there's now a shift towards more cautious hiring strategies by businesses."""

""I don’t look at the economy through the eyes of Wall Street and Park Avenue. I look at it through the eyes of the people I grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania or Claymont, Delaware,"" Biden’s X account read on Monday.

Though some Democrats have pressed Biden to move away from discussing his ""Bidenomics"" strategy, the Biden administration has continued to double down on its alleged success.

Many other X users, however, did not agree.

Author Edward Dowd asked, ""And what did the fine folks in Scranton tell you? Are they more bullish on the economy than Wall Street or less? Seriously what are we saying here? What does this mean?""

""He looks at the economy through the eyes of a Socialist with dementia,"" podcast host Dr. Mark Young explained.

Former Republican congressional candidate Jack Lombardi wrote, ""Well then you should go ahead and admit your economy sucks. Because the average American, my fellow non-elite American, is struggling under your failed polices. Your record number of EOs you bragged about signing caused this.""

""Especially when they pay you $50K p/m in rent, amirite?"" immigration lawyer Matthew Kolken joked.

A recent Fox News survey in October found that 62% of Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy with only 37% approval.

In addition, a Marquette University poll found former President Donald Trump had a 23- to 24-point lead with voters on handling inflation, the economy and the border. Trump also held a 19-point lead over Biden in voters' confidence in the candidate creating jobs.

Dec 14 2023,The Economy Is Running on Fumes. A Recession Is Right around the Corner,National Review (News),right,https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/12/the-economy-is-running-on-fumes-a-recession-is-right-around-the-corner/,
Feb 02 2024,"The US economy added 353,000 jobs in January, starting off 2024 with a bang",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/economy/january-jobs-report-final/index.html,"New York CNN —

The US economy added a stunning 353,000 jobs last month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday, registering a stronger-than-expected gain to kick off 2024 and underscoring the resilience of the US economy in an election year.

The unemployment rate remained at 3.7% from the month before. It’s the 24th consecutive month that the nation’s jobless rate has been under 4%.

“The fact that the unemployment rate has been below 4% for 24 months straight for the first time since 1967 is truly remarkable,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist and principal at RSM US, told CNN. “And that’s the word I keep saying as I look through this report: ‘This is remarkable.’ ‘Remarkable,’ is the takeaway here.”

More than a year ago, it seemed all but certain that the labor market would feel the effects of — and potentially be reeling from — the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign. But 11 hikes and four pauses later, the US job market is registering one of the longest periods of expansion this century.

January’s job gains dashed market expectations for a Fed rate cut to come sooner than later, perhaps as early as March, and for the central bank to cut as many as six times in 2024. Investors’ probability for a March rate cut dropped from 38% to under 20% on Friday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

However, the stronger-than-expected tally should help boost Americans’ tepid sentiments about the economy. And it shouldn’t knock the Fed off its current path, with officials having telegraphed a trio of rate cuts to occur this year, Brusuelas said.

“The Fed’s going to have to manage expectations very carefully here going forward,” he said. Powell signaled that the central bank wants to cut — and now “It’s just matter of not if, but when.”

An upside surprise

Hiring accelerated from December, which itself had far stronger employment growth than previously estimated. December’s job gains were revised higher by 117,000 positions to total 333,000 for the month. November was revised up as well, but only by 9,000 jobs, to a 182,000 net job gain.

January’s gains blew economists’ expectations out of the water: Consensus forecasts had called for a net gain of 176,500 jobs last month, according to FactSet.

Still, economists have cautioned that the January report is among the trickiest to forecast because it’s typically a big month for job losses (with seasonal workers being let go after the holidays and other businesses doing some new year’s belt-tightening). Additionally, the BLS applies new seasonal adjustment factors at the start of the year to help smooth out the data and better understand the trends.

For these reasons, some economists told CNN this week that it’s possible January would deliver an upside surprise.

They got one.

Where the job growth occurred

Most major industries — mining and logging excluded — added jobs in January, BLS data shows.

Private education and health services continued to drive job growth with 112,000 job gains. Health care and social assistance accounted for 100,400 of those, followed by professional and business services at 74,000 and retail trade at 45,200.

The leisure and hospitality industry added a mere 11,000 jobs in January but registered its 36th consecutive month of job gains, BLS data shows. As of January, this critical service industry that was bludgeoned at the outset of the pandemic is a mere 0.4% (75,000 jobs) from reaching its February 2020 employment levels.

During the recovery from the pandemic, leisure and hospitality and other services businesses have benefited from Americans’ strong desires to spend money on experiences.

150+ applicants for 30 jobs

In Minneapolis, Jillian Hiscock had little problem finding the more than two dozen workers she needed for her new sports bar.

Hiscock is about a month away from opening A Bar of Their Own, a bar and restaurant that exclusively will show women’s sporting events. The concept, which was inspired by industry trailblazer The Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, has garnered overwhelming support from the Twin Cities community since Hiscock floated the idea last spring and ran a crowdfunding campaign to get it off the ground.

The same was true for hiring efforts by A Bar of Their Own: She received 150 applications in two days’ time for 25 to 30 open positions.

“It’s a good problem to have, but I just wanted to make sure that we were being realistic about who we could actually communicate with, given our timeline,” she said. “But yeah, we had to turn it off in less than two days with over five times as many applicants as we needed for the positions we had available.”

The applicants came from all walks of life and included people who had experience in restaurants as well as folks who were out of work or looking to switch jobs or even careers.

“Since things have opened back up [following the pandemic], we’ve had a lot of folks whose relationships with work has fundamentally changed,” she said. “Showing up and just doing a thing for somebody that you feel doesn’t care about as a human is less interesting to people now, because we all know how quickly that can be taken away.”

People continue to want a better balance between their working life and personal life, she said.

“People were really excited about this, not just seeing this as another job, but seeing this as an opportunity to be a part of something bigger,” she said.

A banner year

The January jobs report also included the final figures for the BLS’ annual benchmark review of payroll data. US job growth last year was indeed weaker than initially estimated (by 266,000 jobs); however, that’s not as weak as the preliminary benchmark estimates suggested it could be.

Even with those revisions in play, 2023 was a banner year for job growth. Nearly 3.06 million jobs were added last year, seasonally adjusted data show. Outside of the record-shattering 2021 and 2022, that’s the highest annual jobs total since 1999 and the 17th largest on records that go back to 1939, BLS data show.

Also delivering a surprise were wage gains, which surged 0.6% for the month and 4.5% year-over-year.

“This elevates the risk that nominal wage growth will not fall back to levels consistent with reaching the inflation target on a sustained basis, particularly as the labor force participation rate refuses to rise any further,” Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings’ chief economist, wrote in a note issued Friday. “Wages growing at this rate, in a labor market this tight, is a problem for the Fed.”

Burying the recession expectations

The strong labor market has been the foundation for the surges in consumer spending — and robust economic growth — that the United States has seen in recent months. And while businesses have reined in hiring, people are quitting less and wage gains have seen some easing, the slowing pace of inflation means that people’s paychecks are finally able to go further than they have in years.

However, despite the strong economy, Americans have been mostly downbeat — although attitudes are on the upswing. A new CNN poll released Friday showed that 35% of Americans say things in the country today are going well. That’s an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall.

The poll found that the sentiment is heavily influenced by partisanship, with the uptick being led by Democrats.

While the estimated 4.5% annual hourly earnings growth reported Friday may trigger a dull headache for the Fed, it’s ultimately good for the American psyche, Brusuelas said.

“This should put the last of the recession calls six feet under,” he said. “It’s about jobs, and it’s about what people make, and this data reflects the increase in productivity. Improved productivity leads to improved number of jobs, better pay and rising living standards. It’s that mythical tide that lifts all boats.”"
Jan 05 2024,"The US economy added 216,000 jobs in December",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/05/economy/jobs-report-december-final/index.html,"New York CNN —

Friday’s jobs report marked a fitting end to what was an odds-defying year.

The US economy added 216,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The monthly total blew past expectations for a net gain of 160,000 jobs and capped off what’s been a year of resilience in the labor market.

Around this time last year, many experts said it was a sure bet that the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting rate-hiking campaign would result in job losses mounting and send the economy into a recession.

Instead, the labor market’s continued strength helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth during the past 12 months. The job market has indeed cooled down but did not derail despite 11 Fed hikes that brought the benchmark interest rate 5 percentage points higher in under two years’ time.

“We’ve lived through something quite unprecedented, which is such a large increase in interest rates and such a sharp drop in inflation without a meaningful increase in unemployment,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNN in an interview. “It’s never happened before.”

The Fed appears to be nailing the so-called “soft landing” of bringing inflation down without flinging the economy into a recession.

But the plane hasn’t landed just yet.

Friday’s jobs report also showed that the labor market and the broader economy remain at a turning point, with the ultimate destination likely hinging on interest rates coming down from 22-year highs, she said.

“We are seeing the labor market slow pretty substantially,” Pollak said, noting October and November were revised down by a combined 71,000 jobs. “The underlying rate of job growth is around 150,000/140,000, and that will continue to gradually slow in the coming months until the Fed takes its foot off the brake pedal.”

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has long cautioned that the labor market needs to cool from its breakneck pace and have a better alignment in the number of jobs available and the number of people hoping to take them. Last month, he acknowledged that the US jobs market had come into “better balance.”

Powell’s comments, and a batch of positive inflation data, helped fuel optimism from the markets that the Fed could start cutting rates sooner than later.

Friday’s robust jobs total and stronger-than-expected wage gains — 0.4% monthly and 4.1% annually — likely pushes that back, Andrew Patterson, Vanguard’s senior international economist, wrote Friday.

“Today’s report speaks to the bumpy road ahead for the Fed’s journey back to 2% inflation,” Patterson said, noting the central bank’s inflation target. “Strong headline job growth and wage growth above 4% combined with Fed communications, including the minutes, emphasizing the need to remain higher for longer decrease the likelihood of preemptive rate cuts.”

He added: “The decision of when to first cut policy rates remains one for the second half of the year, in our view.”

‘An extraordinary year’ for labor

Through 2023, the United States recorded a net gain of nearly 2.7 million jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the BLS. That averages out to a net gain of 225,000 per month.

That’s almost half of the 4.79 million jobs gained in 2022, which was the second-highest annual total on records going back to 1939. It’s also significantly under 2021’s record-setting year, when 7.27 million jobs were added as the nation continued to recover from the massive losses seen during Covid.

However, the 2.7 million jobs yearly total is more in line with what was seen during the economic expansion that occurred in the decade before the pandemic.

“The December [jobs report] resulted in a net increase of 216,000 in job creation, bringing to a close an extraordinary year in job creation,” Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, wrote in a note issued Friday. “During the past year unemployment averaged 3.6% and closed the year at 3.7% in what the best year for labor since the 1950s.”

In January of last year, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, hitting a level not seen since May 1969, two months before Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.

In April 2023, the unemployment rate for Black workers hit a record low of 4.7%.

And then in June, the labor force participation rate for women in their prime working age (25-54 years old) hit an all-time high of 77.8%.

Some warning signs

Last month’s gains were fueled by continued strong hiring in government (up 52,000 jobs), health care (+37,700), social assistance (+21,200 jobs), construction (+17,000 jobs) and leisure and hospitality (+12,000 jobs).

Those drivers of growth also serve as causes for concern.

During the past six months, 92% of all job gains were concentrated in three sectors: health care, government and leisure and hospitality, Pollak said. Spread across the whole year, that share was 76%, she added.

“Typically, job growth is more broad-based,” she said. “And so outside of those sectors, it’s looking pretty anemic in 2023.”

Labor turnover data released Wednesday showed a steep drop in hiring and quits, the latter providing a measurement of opportunity in the economy.

“Those are warning signs that perhaps we could be at risk of some overcooling in the coming months,” she said.

What could help counterbalance that is wage growth, she noted.

During the course of 2023, average hourly earnings slowed from a 4.8% annual growth rate in December 2022 to 4.1% last month, BLS data shows. As of November, annual inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) has cooled to 3.1% from 6.5% in December 2022, according to the BLS.

“In May [2023], real wage growth flipped positive, and that has been a good news story for workers who are really hurting after 25 straight months of negative real wage growth,” she said. “It’s good news for the economy going forward; it does somewhat reduce the risk of a recession early in the year, and it props up consumer spending, demand and revenues for businesses.”

Plus, she added, “productivity has been so high, it’s not necessarily inflationary.”"

TMJ4's Chief Political Reporter Charles Benson is covering the caucuses and looks at a key issue in 2024 election.

Dubuque is the oldest city in Iowa, known as the Masterpiece on the Mississippi because of its scenic views with a river that separates Iowa from Wisconsin and Illinois.

It’s also a good place see how the economy is working in this city of 60,000.

Angela Lee knows what it’s like to run a small business - she has seen inflation drive up costs at The Spot Nutrition juice bar and has adjusted.

""The cost of doing business has gone up a little bit - we’ve had to go up in prices,"" said Lee.

Lee and her husband are also raising two children - she feels they are in a good place right now.

""Business is going well - we had a really good year last year.""

Poll after poll point to the economy as a key issue in the 2024 election and it may play a role in who wins the Iowa caucuses Monday night.

The unemployment rate in Dubuque dropped last year - it’s now around 3% - that’s better than the national average of 3.7%.

Inflation and gas prices have come down but the cost of things are still expensive. Wages are up but so are interest rates.

Tut Fuller opened Capra Bank in his native hometown less than a year ago.

He’s seeing the impact of higher rates.

""Housing starts have been extremely slow, said Fuller. The mortgage industry is not doing a lot of mortgages right now and that’s not just in Dubuque, that’s all over.""

Dubuque has a healthy dose of manufacturing jobs and tourism is important to the local economy, but like many cities it needs more help with childcare needs.

Fuller sees an economy that has bounced back from the pandemic.

""Yeah, borrowing costs are up a little bit, but I don’t know, I think it’s pretty healthy and resilient.""

Dubuque County is more purple than red or blue in recent presidential elections. Barack Obama won here in 2008 and 2012. Donald Trump carried the county 2016 and 20.

Jan 25 2024,US economy grew faster than expected during the 4th quarter,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-fourth-quarter-2023,"The U.S. economy grew at a faster pace than expected at the end of 2023, underscoring its resilience even in the face of still-high inflation and steep interest rates.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew by 3.3% on an annualized basis in the three-month period from October through December, the Commerce Department said in its first reading of the data Thursday.

That is far higher than the 2% increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, although it marks a notable drop from the rapid 4.9% pace seen during the third quarter.

""GDP has four cylinders, and the fourth quarter fired on them all,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Pundits are already saying this will be as good as it gets, but then again, most were predicting a recession last year that never came.""

WHEN WILL THE FEDERAL RESERVE START TO CUT INTEREST RATES?

Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, continued to power economic growth during the fourth quarter. It rose 2.8% for the period, down just slightly from the previous quarter.

Increases in private inventory investments, a boost in federal government spending and a jump in non-residential fixed income also helped to boost the GDP numbers. However, high mortgage rates continued to drain demand from the real estate market, with investment in housing plunging 27% for a second straight quarter.

State and local government spending also helped to fuel the expansion, climbing 3.7% during the fourth quarter. Gross private domestic investment rose 2.1%, another contributor to growth.

""Once again, it’s the strength and resiliency of the consumer that carries the day for the U.S. economy,"" said Jim Baird, Plante Moran Financial Advisors CIO. ""Solid labor market conditions and wage growth coupled with the ability to tap cash and available credit continue to fuel spending.""

The economy has remained solid even as experts predicted that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike campaign would send it spiraling into a recession. For all of 2023, the economy expanded 3.1%, up less than 1% in the previous year.

However, there are signs that growth is finally beginning to slow in the face of tighter monetary policy. Job growth is moderating. The housing market, which is vulnerable to higher interest rates, is trapped in a prolonged downturn, and consumer spending has shown signs of cooling off.

Many economists expect to see further cooling in coming months as higher interest rates continue to work their way through the economy.

(KNWA/KFTA) — Walther Manufacturing announced it is expanding its facility in Fort Smith.

The gun factory will use $30 million to add 40,000 square feet onto its existing 185,000-square-foot facility. The project is supposed to begin within the next few months, adding 76 jobs.

“Walther Manufacturing is making a substantial investment in our Fort Smith factory to facilitate the expansion of our research development and manufacturing of U.S.-produced firearms and accessories,” Tom Goike, Walther Manufacturing President and CEO said in a statement.

The increased number of jobs could provide economic impacts on the surrounding area.

“It’s always great when businesses bring in more work,” Robert Lopez, owner of Las Americas Restaurant, said. “Somebody else is growing, we grow, other businesses grow.

“People like to go out, try new cuisines, new stores, what’s new, so it works out for everybody.”

Mundi Ross, the director of marketing with Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority, said Walther Manufacturing’s facility expansion could have a variety of impacts.

“That equals tax dollars,” Ross said. “That equals an opportunity to go and enjoy our local cultural scene.”

Ross said she is excited about the future of the Fort Smith area and its potential growth. She described Fort Chaffee, Fort Smith and Barling as “one entity.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders met with Walther Manufacturing — which has had a presence in Arkansas since 2012 — during her European trade mission in the summer of 2023."

Jan 30 2024,The booming American economy leads the IMF to upgrade its outlook for the whole world this year,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/imf-world-economy-outlook-forecast-america-boom-soft-landing,"The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its outlook for the world economy this year, envisioning resilient growth led by the United States and a slower pace of inflation.

In its latest outlook, the 190-country lending agency said Tuesday that it now expects the global economy to grow 3.1% this year, unchanged from 2023 but better than the 2.9% it had predicted for 2024 in its previous estimate in October.

Worldwide, the IMF thinks inflation will ease from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. In the most advanced economies, the agency expects inflation to drop this year to 2.6% and next year to the 2% level that the Federal Reserve and some other central banks have set as a target.

The combination of steady growth and falling inflation has raised hopes for a so-called soft landing for the global economy – a slowdown sufficient to contain inflation without causing a recession.

“We are now in the final descent toward a soft landing,’’ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, told reporters ahead of the report’s release.

The forecast for overall global growth this year and next (3.2%) trails the 3.8% average from 2000 to 2019. That is partly because the Fed and other central banks aggressively raised interest rates to fight high inflation, and the resulting higher borrowing costs have slowed spending and investment.

Gourinchas said he expects “relatively limited’’ economic damage from the attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea. The attacks have forced container ships carrying cargo between Asia and Europe to avoid the Suez Canal and instead take the long way around the tip of Africa, thereby delaying and disrupting shipments and raising freight charges. But Gourinchas said that for now, the Red Sea disruptions don’t seem to be “a major source of reigniting supply side inflation,” which arose from far more severe shipping backlogs in 2021 and 2022.

For the United States, the world’s largest economy, the IMF sharply marked up its estimate for growth this year – to 2.1% from the 1.5% it had penciled in three months ago. The U.S. economy expanded 2.5% in 2023 after an unexpected burst of year-end growth fueled by consumers willing to spend despite higher borrowing costs.

The outlook for the slumping Chinese economy was also upgraded by the IMF. It now expects the world’s second-biggest economy to grow 4.6% this year, up from the 4.2% it had forecast in October but down from 5.2% growth in 2023. Government spending has helped offset the damage from a collapse in the Chinese housing market.

“There was a lot of resilience in many, many parts of the world,’’ Gourinchas said, singling out Brazil, India, Southeast Asia and Russia, which has remained surprisingly sturdy in the face of Western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine.

But the IMF downgraded the outlook for some places. Europe, for example, continues to struggle with dispirited consumers and the lingering effects of the energy price shock caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The IMF expects the 20 countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow a meager 0.9% this year. That would be up from 0.5% growth in 2023 but down from the IMF’s October forecast of 1.2% growth for the eurozone this year.

The IMF also modestly downgraded the outlook for the Japanese economy, to 0.9%, a drop from 1.9% growth in 2023.

The improving inflation outlook is a result of higher interest rates, the end of the supply chain backlogs of the past couple of years, more workers entering the job market and lower energy prices after the spike caused by the Ukraine war. The IMF expects oil prices, which plunged 16% in 2023, to fall a further 2.3% this year and 4.8% in 2025.

The world economy still faces risks. One is that financial markets have become too confident that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates as early as its meeting in March. Gourinchas said he doesn’t expect the rate-cutting to start until the second half of 2024. Disappointed investors could drive down stock prices if they don’t see lower rates as soon as they hoped.

Another is that geopolitical tensions, especially between the United States and China, could disrupt world trade. Gourinchas suggested that some of President Joe Biden’s economic policies, including those that benefit American producers of computer chips and green technology, could violate World Trade Organization rules.

The IMF expects world trade to grow just 3.3% this year and 3.6% in 2025, below the historical average of 4.9%."
Jan 23 2024,It’s primary time in New Hampshire. Here’s a snapshot of the Granite State’s economy,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/new-hampshire-economy-primary/index.html,"New York CNN —

New Hampshire, the “first-in-the-nation” primary state (which will hold those elections Tuesday), has been a relatively “better-off” state than most others nationally.

Unemployment is low, economic growth is strong, but that doesn’t mean life in the Granite State is without its bumps.

Here’s a snapshot of New Hampshire’s economy in advance of Tuesday’s election.

Strong job market

New Hampshire has a diverse mix of industries, similar to that of the United States overall, but with hubs in fields such as health care, education and manufacturing.

And while it’s a state with one of the highest interstate commuting rates in the nation (thanks to its proximity to other metro areas, specifically Boston), New Hampshire boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates, logging a preliminary jobless rate of 2.3% in November, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

“It’s sort of a ‘good news/bad news situation,’” said Charlie Dougherty, a Wells Fargo senior economist who follows the Northeast US region closely. “The good news is, it represents a strong labor market, where a lot of folks have employment, and for those who find themselves displaced, it’s relatively easy to find another job.”

The bad news?

“The challenge is for businesses who are trying to hire,” he said.

Tough for employers to find workers

Worker shortages have been a key theme of the pandemic recovery across the nation as economic growth outstripped businesses’ abilities to hire enough employees. Several factors contributed to the tight labor market, including early retirements, Covid-related deaths and long-term health issues, caregiving needs, health and safety concerns, and a greater desire for work-life balance. However, the situation has been more acute in New Hampshire.

“New Hampshire is going to run into some headwinds, when it comes to slower population growth,” Dougherty said. “New Hampshire skews a little bit older, and as more people age out of the labor force, it’s going to present some challenges to overall growth in the state over the long run.”

As of November, there were 2.1 jobs for every person looking for one in New Hampshire, according to BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover state-specific data released last week. Nationally, that ratio is 1.4.

Both rates are trending down toward their pre-pandemic levels; however, New Hampshire still has a ways to go. Tight labor markets are seen as problematic in the context of inflation: The Federal Reserve views out-of-balance labor markets as potential drivers of higher wages that, in turn, can lead to higher prices and keep inflation elevated.

Additionally, while the state’s lack of income tax or sales tax means it is attractive for businesses and workers, New Hampshire is running up against a housing crisis.

“You’ve got to get the people here; but even if you get the people, where are they going to live?” Patricia M. Anderson, a professor of economics at Dartmouth University, told CNN in an interview.

Housing becoming increasingly unaffordable

Housing affordability has eroded in New Hampshire in recent years. Rising home prices coupled with higher mortgage rates put homebuying out of reach for many residents.

“This is a trend that you’ve seen especially in the Northeast, where the housing supply’s a little more limited, and that exerts upward pressure on prices,” Dougherty said.

In the quaint town of Chester, New Hampshire, located about 20 minutes outside of Manchester, home prices have jumped in the past year, said Patrick Connelly, whose family has run Field to Fork Farm, an organic farm and now event venue, for almost two decades.

“People can’t find rentals; there are certainly people that want to live in our town, and there are hundreds of houses backlogged to be built until things loosen up,” Connelly said, referencing the high interest rate environment. “So there’s a lot of growth in our area, in our small little town, but that’s not going to help the big issue of affordable housing, because the houses they’re building are all $700,000-$900,000 homes where the builders make the most money.”

Counterbalancing the limited income tax and lack of sales tax collections, property taxes in New Hampshire are the third-highest nationwide, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.

The state has allocated $100 million in federal Covid-19 recovery funds to build more affordable housing and help boost the workforce.

Tourism

New Hampshire’s important tourism industry has recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of visitors and revenue.

People wanted a place to go after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, said Brian Gottlob, the state’s economist.

“When the pandemic receded, that pent-up desire got spent,” he said. “A good part of it [was] because New Hampshire does a really, really good job of creating an image and marketing.”

In 2021, when air travel was still down, the state’s tourism division increased its digital marketing campaigns in areas within driving distance, such as Ohio and Washington, DC, said Lori Harnois, New Hampshire’s tourism director. It is now marketing more heavily in Canada and larger portions of New York and Pennsylvania.

Some 4.5 million visitors spent $2.3 billion in New Hampshire last summer. Both metrics are up 3.3% from the summer of 2022, she said. Part of the increase in spending is due to inflation.

However, the industry remains about 800 to 1,000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic staffing levels as the state struggles with labor shortages, Gottlob said. Tourism, which encompasses leisure and hospitality, is New Hampshire’s second-largest employer, behind retail.

Median income/poverty

The typical New Hampshire household has a higher income compared to the average in the United States, and a smaller share of state’s residents are in poverty.

The median household income in New Hampshire was just under $90,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the Census Bureau.

And the Granite State has the lowest official poverty rate of any state, at 7.2% for 2022, while the nation’s rate is 12.6%, according to the bureau’s American Community Survey.

Southeastern New Hampshire — where three-quarters of the state’s residents live — benefits from being close to the Boston metropolitan area, said Phil Sletten, research director at the left-leaning New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. That region has the highest median incomes and lowest poverty rates in the Granite State.

But other parts of New Hampshire — particularly the northernmost and west-central areas, which are rural — are struggling more in comparison. Their poverty rates were 11.6% and 11.7%, respectively, during the 2018 to 2022 time frame, compared to 7.3% for the state over that time period, according to Sletten.

Also, Sletten noted, it’s important to consider that New Hampshire is a relatively expensive state to live in.

“If you look at the top-level numbers, it is a better-off state in terms of its economic fortunes than many other states,” he said. But “when we compare incomes across states, unless you’re adjusting for the cost of living, that may not indicate the overall economic well-being or financial security of households.”

Rosier sentiment and outlook

New Hampshire residents give President Joe Biden somewhat higher marks on his handling of the economy compared to what other surveys have found for the nation at large. Some 42% of New Hampshire residents approved of Biden on the economy, with 55% disapproving, according to a November CNN/University of New Hampshire poll.

New Hampshire’s economy expanded at a 4.5% rate during the third quarter of last year, according to Commerce Department data. That robust rate was close to the national average of 4.9%.

But when it comes to their personal finances, New Hampshire residents are downbeat. Some 46% think their household is worse off financially than a year ago, while only 15% say they are better off, and 39% feel their finances are about the same, according to a December poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.

One bright note: In 2022, some 61% of Granite Staters felt their household was worse off — but the current share is still “considerably higher” than it was in 2021, the center said.

Residents’ sentiments vary widely by party. The share of Republicans who say they are worse off is near an all-time high, while the shares of Democrats and Independents who feel this way have “fallen considerably” over the past year, according to the center.

“I think my friends and the people I associate with are pretty emboldened in who they’re going to be voting for, and I think the economy wouldn’t really affect it that much,” Connelly said. “I think that’s pretty common in New Hampshire. The people are really in their camps, and they’re not moving.”"
Feb 02 2024,"US job growth unexpectedly jumps in January as economy adds 353,000 new positions",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-january-2024,"U.S. job growth unexpectedly surged in January, underscoring the resilience of the labor market even in the face of high interest rates and stubborn inflation.

Employers added 353,000 jobs in January , the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, easily topping the 180,000 gain forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, against expectations for a slight increase.

Wage growth also accelerated last month, with average hourly earnings — a key measure of inflation — rising 0.6%, double what economists had expected. On an annual basis, wages rose 4.5% in January. However, that coincided with a drop in average hours worked, which fell by 0.2 hour last month to 34.1 hours.

THE NUMBER OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS IS DWINDLING

In another show of strength for the economy, the report contained sizable upward revisions to job growth during the previous two months. Gains for November and December were revised up by a total of 126,000 jobs to a respective 182,000 and 333,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is stronger than it previously appeared.

The surprisingly strong report paints a picture of a job market that has gone largely unscathed despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate hike campaign, but it also diminishes the odds of an imminent rate cut.

""The dramatic upside surprise to both jobs and wage growth means that a March rate cut must be off the table now, and a May cut is also now potentially on ice,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""Certainly, with this kind of number, the six or seven rate cuts that markets had been pricing in seems very offside.""

AMERICANS IN THESE STATES ARE GETTING A PAY RAISE THIS YEAR

The Federal Reserve signaled it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally softening after months of solid job gains as policymakers try to ensure that inflation continues to ease. The consumer price index has cooled considerably in recent months but remains above the Fed's preferred 2% target, despite 11 rate hikes in the span of 16 months.

Faster job growth and the unexpected uptick in wage gains complicate the U.S. central bank's plans to start unwinding tighter monetary policy. Policymakers held interest rates steady at the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday and signaled that they are prepared to cut interest rates later this year.

""If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,"" Chair Jerome Powell told reporters during a post-meeting press conference in Washington, D.C. ""But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured.""

Stock futures fell after the report dashed investors' hopes for a March rate reduction, and called into doubt the prospect of a May cut. Just 17% of investors are currently pricing in a quarter-point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

Job gains were broad-based last month, with the biggest gains in professional and business services (74,000), health care (70,000), retail trade (45,200), government (36,000) and manufacturing (23,000).

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown.

""So much for the cooling labor market,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. ""The best part of the blockbuster number is how widespread the hiring has become. ... This shows a growing labor market reflecting a broad-based economic expansion, and not just recoveries in a few sectors such as health care and government."""
Jan 09 2024,US farmers warn Biden’s economy spells ‘destruction’ ahead of 2024 Iowa caucuses,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/us-farmers-warn-bidens-economy-destruction-2024-iowa-caucuses,"With the Republican Iowa caucuses just one week away, Hawkeye State farmers are revealing how the 2024 presidential election will serve as a pivotal moment for the economy and agricultural industry.

""I'm afraid if we keep heading down this path, we've got a lot of destruction ahead,"" fifth-generation farmer Rick DeGroote told FOX Business’ Grady Trimble.

U.S. Department of Agriculture data estimates that production costs for farmers increased by about $15 billion in 2023. Additionally, American corn producers reportedly worry the Biden administration’s electric vehicle push will drastically reduce demand for corn-based ethanol, which is used to power gas engines.

Although Iowa’s farmland stays mostly barren in the dead of winter, its political landscape is anything but, as DeGroote represents one of many industry leaders who feel at a crossroads in the upcoming election.

U.S. COWBOYS TRAVEL TO ISRAEL TO HELP FARMERS HARVEST THEIR CROPS: THEY HAVE A GOD-GIVEN ‘RIGHT’ TO THIS LAND

""Most of our corn goes to ethanol, and without that, that would cripple the farm economy,"" DeGroote added.

""It seems like that we are an easy scapegoat for a population that is looking for someone to blame, and knowing full well that we really don't have a very big voice,"" said Kyle Mehmen, of MBS Family Farms.

For the first time in its 55-year history, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) reported in its annual Winter Reliability Assessment that energy policy is one of the top threats to the U.S. power grid due to the Biden administration's green agenda. It also said the key factors contributing to the risk are increasing demand for electricity to power things like electric vehicles, decreasing generation due to the premature closures of coal and gas-fired power plants.

When Trimble polled a focus group of six Iowa farmer-constituents, four Republicans answered that they stand undecided over which candidate to support as the party’s presidential nominee.

""I want to see strong economic policy for our country. The issues that face my farm are no different than any other business. It’s inflation, it’s labor, it’s taxation, so that’s what I’m looking at in the candidates this year,"" sixth-generation farmer from Jesup, Ben Riensche also told Trimble.

Husband-wife farming team Eric and Krystal Doolittle claim they've been dissatisfied with the past four years, and want to see someone ""other than Biden"" be elected to office.

""I am a person that wants to pick the president based on their policies, and being in the [agriculture] industry, it’s really easy to see how policies impact us directly,"" Krystal said, while her husband listed ""rising interest costs that we’re undergoing now, and the massive amount of inflation.""

The latest FOX Business poll indicated former President Donald Trump leads by 34 points amongst surveyed Iowa Republicans, and that 52% of likely GOP caucus-goers support Trump , putting him over 50% for the first time. Next, it’s Ron DeSantis at 18% and Nikki Haley at 16%.

The Fed was widely expected to stand pat today, and it did. Investors also were watching to see whether Fed chair Jay Powell would hint at the central bank’s outlook on a potential rate hike at its December meeting. He insisted the decision will be based on data—two more inflation readings, two more labor market readings—and not prejudged.

“This has been a resilient economy, it’s been surprising in its resilience,” Powell told reporters after the Federal Open Market Committee finished its November meeting.

The big question for markets and citizens remains the same: How soon will the Fed be prepared to cut rates? You’ll be shocked to hear that some economists think the economy is still too hot and liable to see prices increase too quickly, while others fret that the Fed is in danger of overshooting and plunging the economy into a deep recession.

Powell says he and his colleagues haven’t even gotten to the question of cuts yet; he still isn’t sure whether monetary policy is tight enough to keep driving inflation downward. The Fed’s answer is to wait and watch, but there are still dangers in the monetary policy board’s apparent plans to keep interest rates where they are for longer.

The economy is sending mixed signals, although perhaps less mixed than in recent months. On the plus side: Third-quarter GDP growth shot through the roof at a 4.9% annualized rate, and the job market remains robust, while inflation continues to trend lower despite slight boosts in recent reports. The Fed’s preferred inflation index, based on government analysis of household spending, rose 3.4% year-over-year in September. That’s higher than the Fed’s 2% target, but far less than the 6.5% increase in prices seen in September 2022.

What about the other data, particularly sentiment and survey data that asks businesses and consumers about their views and plans? Those figures have diverged from the actual economic indicators—perhaps a sign that non-economic grumbles are leaking into questions about finances—but even consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan is starting to turn around.

Without a recession, the US economy is nearly in uncharted territory

Much-mocked recession predictions from economists like Harvard’s Larry Summers relied on historical data. In one 2022 working paper, Summers cited 11 historical instances where average wage inflation was 5% and the unemployment rate was below 5%—each time, there was a recession within two years. He also cited eight instances where average wage inflation was above 5% and unemployment was below 4%—again, each time there was a recession within two years.

The US economy tripped the first wire in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the second in the first quarter of 2022. That means if the US makes it through March 2024 without a recession, we’ll be in uncharted territory. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast suggests we might make it at least part way, predicting 1.2% real growth in the last quarter of this year. The specter of growth petering out before the Fed cuts rates is still hovering over all of this, though Powell said today that the central bank’s staff isn’t forecasting a recession.

The presumption behind these recession predictions is that to fight inflation, the Fed would have to raise interest rates high enough to cause a recession. Instead, the economy has been robust even with higher interest rates and inflation has fallen without too much pain for the average American, at least thus far. That might suggest that supply problems related to the pandemic had a big role to play in high inflation; indeed, for the first time in 35 months, US manufacturers are no longer reporting shortages of silicon chips.

The Fed’s interest rate increases have not been without impact

Though the Fed has yet to truly diminish demand in the US, the effects of higher interest rates are starting to crimp investment. That’s notable in the housing market, where 30-year mortgage rates above 7% have slowed new homes under construction, but also in all kinds of businesses that depend on credit, particularly in large green energy projects like building wind turbines. High interest rates also are weighing on the US government, which is assuming a much larger burden to borrow at a time when deficits are unusually high.

Bond markets have watched all this with caution. Last week’s hot GDP print brought a sell-off of US government debt, leading to a burst of higher yields for longer term US bonds. That could finally end the “yield curve inversion”—the fact that it costs the US government less to borrow money for 10 years than it does for just a month.

That could be interpreted in several ways: Powell says it’s not clear yet if this trend is persistent or just run-of-the-mill market volatility. Bill Gross, the erstwhile Bond King, is expecting a recession before the end of the year and is betting that the Fed will cut rates, making those cheap bonds more valuable. It could simply be a sign of slowing demand for Treasurys, as the US sells more debt and the Fed buys less of it. It might actually be the markets doing the Fed’s job for it, since higher yields mean tighter credit across the economy, and returning the yield curve to its normal slope.

That gets at the Powell’s challenge in these unusual times. The central bank was late to start to reigning in the bucking bronco of the US economy when it started hiking in 2022. But after several years of tightening its hold, it’s not clear whether hanging on or letting go is the safer option."
Oct 30 2023,The Secretive Industry Devouring the U.S. Economy,The Atlantic,left,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/,"Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET on October 30, 2023

The publicly traded company is disappearing. In 1996, about 8,000 firms were listed in the U.S. stock market. Since then, the national economy has grown by nearly $20 trillion. The population has increased by 70 million people. And yet, today, the number of American public companies stands at fewer than 4,000. How can that be?

One answer is that the private-equity industry is devouring them. When a private-equity fund buys a publicly traded company, it takes the company private—hence the name. (If the company has not yet gone public, the acquisition keeps that from happening.) This gives the fund total control, which in theory allows it to find ways to boost profits so that it can sell the company for a big payday a few years later. In practice, going private can have more troubling consequences. The thing about public companies is that they’re, well, public. By law, they have to disclose information about their finances, operations, business risks, and legal liabilities. Taking a company private exempts it from those requirements.

That may not have been such a big deal when private equity was a niche industry. Today, however, it’s anything but. In 2000, private-equity firms managed about 4 percent of total U.S. corporate equity. By 2021, that number was closer to 20 percent. In other words, private equity has been growing nearly five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole.

James Surowiecki: The method in the market’s madness

Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University who studies corporate finance, told me that if current trends continue, “we could end up with a completely opaque economy.”

This should alarm you even if you’ve never bought a stock in your life. One-fifth of the market has been made effectively invisible to investors, the media, and regulators. Information as basic as who actually owns a company, how it makes its money, or whether it is profitable is “disappearing indefinitely into private equity darkness,” as the Harvard Law professor John Coates writes in his book The Problem of Twelve. This is not a recipe for corporate responsibility or economic stability. A private economy is one in which companies can more easily get away with wrongdoing and an economic crisis can take everyone by surprise. And to a startling degree, a private economy is what we already have.

America learned the hard way what happens when corporations operate in the dark. Before the Great Depression, the whole U.S. economy functioned sort of like the crypto market in 2021. Companies could raise however much money they wanted from whomever they wanted. They could claim almost anything about their finances or business model. Investors often had no good way of knowing whether they were being defrauded, let alone whether to expect a good return.

Then came the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From October to December of 1929, the stock market lost 50 percent of its value, with more losses to come. Thousands of banks collapsed, wiping out the savings of millions of Americans. Unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The Great Depression generated a crisis of confidence for American capitalism. Public hearings revealed just how rampant corporate fraud had become before the crash. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws launched a regime of “full and fair disclosure” and created a new government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to enforce it. Now if companies wanted to raise money from the public, they would have to disclose a wide array of information to the public. This would include basic details about the company’s operations and finances, plus a comprehensive list of major risks facing the company, plans for complying with current and future regulations, and documentation of outstanding legal liabilities. All of these disclosures would be reviewed for accuracy by the SEC.

This regime created a new social contract for American capitalism: scale in exchange for transparency. Private companies were limited to 100 investors, putting a hard limit on how quickly they could grow. Any business that wanted to raise serious capital from the public had to submit itself to the new reporting laws. Over the next half century, this disclosure regime would underwrite the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in U.S. history. But it didn’t last. Beginning in the “Greed Is Good” 1980s, a wave of deregulatory reforms made it easier for private companies to raise capital. Most important was the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which allowed private funds to raise an unlimited amount of money from an unlimited number of institutional investors. The law created a loophole that effectively broke the scale-for-transparency bargain. Tellingly, 1997 was the year the number of public companies in America peaked.

From the November 2018 issue: The death of the IPO

“Suddenly, private companies could raise all the money they want without even thinking about an IPO,” De Fontenay said. “That completely undermined the incentives companies had to go public.” Indeed, from 1980 to 2000, an average of 310 companies went public every year; from 2001 to 2022, only 118 did. The number briefly shot up during the coronavirus pandemic but has since fallen. (Over the same time period, the rate of mergers and acquisitions soared, which also helps explain the decline in public companies.)

Meanwhile, private equity has matured into a multitrillion-dollar industry, devoted to making short-term profits from highly leveraged transactions, operating with almost no regulatory or public scrutiny. Not all private-equity deals end in calamity, of course, and not all public companies are paragons of civic virtue. But the secrecy in which private-equity firms operate emboldens them to act more recklessly—and makes it much harder to hold them accountable when they do. Private-equity investment in nursing homes, to take just one example, has grown from about $5 billion at the turn of the century to more than $100 billion today. The results have not been pretty. The industry seems to have recognized that it could improve profit margins by cutting back on staffing while relying more on psychoactive medication. Stories abound of patients being rushed to the hospital after being overprescribed opioids, of bedside call buttons so poorly attended that residents suffer in silence while waiting for help, of nurses being pressured to work while sick with COVID. A 2021 study concluded that private-equity ownership was associated with about 22,500 premature nursing-home deaths from 2005 to 2017—before the wave of death and misery wrought by the pandemic.

Eventually, the public got wind of what was happening. The pandemic death count focused attention on the industry. Journalists and watchdog groups exposed the worst of the behaviors. Policy makers and regulators, at long last, began to take action. But by then, much of the damage had been done. “If we had some form of disclosure, we probably would have seen regulatory action a decade earlier,” Coates told me. “But instead, we’ve had 10-plus years of experimentation and abuse without anyone knowing.”

Something similar could be said about any number of industries, including higher education, newspapers, retail, and grocery stores. Across the economy, private-equity firms are known for laying off workers, evading regulations, reducing the quality of services, and bankrupting companies while ensuring that their own partners are paid handsomely. The veil of secrecy makes all of this easier to execute and harder to stop.

Private-equity funds dispute much of the criticism of the industry. They argue that the horror stories are exaggerated and that a handful of problematic firms shouldn’t tarnish the rest of the industry, which is doing great work. Freed from onerous disclosure requirements, they claim, private companies can build more dynamic, flexible businesses that generate greater returns for shareholders. But the lack of public information makes verifying these claims difficult. Most careful academic studies find that although private-equity funds slightly outperformed the stock market on average prior to the early 2000s, they no longer do so. When you take into account their high fees, they appear to be a worse investment than a simple index fund.

“These companies basically get to write their own stories,” says Alyssa Giachino, the research director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They produce their own reports. They come up with their own numbers. And there’s no one making sure they are telling the truth.”

In the Roaring ’20s, the lack of corporate disclosure allowed a massive financial crisis to build up without anyone noticing. A century later, the growth of a new shadow economy could pose similar risks.

The hallmark of a private-equity deal is the so-called leveraged buyout. Funds take on massive amounts of debt to buy companies, with the goal of reselling in a few years at a profit. If all of that debt becomes hard to pay back—because of, say, an economic downturn or rising interest rates—a wave of defaults could ripple through the financial system. In fact, this has happened before: The original leveraged buyout mania of the 1980s helped spark the 1989 stock-market crash. Since then, private equity has grown into a $12 trillion industry and has begun raising much of its money from unregulated, nonbank lenders, many of which are owned by the same private-equity funds taking out loans in the first place.

Meanwhile, interest rates have reached a 20-year high, posing a direct threat to private equity’s debt-heavy business model. In response, many private-equity funds have migrated toward even riskier forms of backroom financing. Many of these involve taking on even more debt on the assumption that market conditions will soon improve enough to restore profitability. If that doesn’t happen—and many of these big deals fail—the implications could be massive.

Joe Nocera and Bethany McLean: What financial engineering does to hospitals

The industry counters that private markets are a better place for risky deals precisely because they have fewer ties to the real economy. A traditional bank has a bunch of ordinary depositors, whereas if a private-equity firm goes bust, the losers are institutional investors: pension funds, university endowments, wealthy fund managers. Bad, but not catastrophic. The problem, once again, is that no one knows how true that story is. Banks have to disclose information to regulators about how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. Private lenders sidestep all of that, meaning that regulators can’t know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy.

“Everything could be just fine,” says Ana Arsov, a managing director at Moody’s Investors Service who leads research on private lending. “But the point is that we don’t have the information we need to assess risk. Who is making these loans? How big are they? What are the terms? We just don’t know. So the worry is that the leverage in the system might grow and grow and grow without anyone noticing. And we really don’t know what the effects could be if something goes wrong.”

The government appears to be at least somewhat aware of this problem. In August, the SEC proposed a new rule requiring private-equity fund advisers to give more information to their investors. That’s better than nothing, but it hardly addresses the bad behavior or systemic risk. Nearly a century ago, Congress concluded that the nation’s economic system could not survive as long as its most powerful companies were left to operate in the shadows. It took the worst economic cataclysm in American history to learn that lesson. The question now is what it will take to learn it again."

Jan 11 2024,Inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December while Americans grow more confident about the economy,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/inflation-rate-december-2023-falling-prices-impacting-consumers-rcna133050,"Inflation climbed from 3.1% to 3.4% in December, a sign the Federal Reserve will continue to have to wrestle consumer price growth down to its desired 2% level.

Forecasts had been for a reading of 3.2%.

On a monthly basis, inflation hit 0.3%, while core inflation, which strips away the more volatile costs of food and energy, was 3.9%, down from 4% in November but ahead of forecasts for a reading of 3.8%.

The biggest contributors to December's pickup in price growth were housing and shelter costs, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said accounted for more than half of the gain. On a year over year basis, total shelter costs increased 6.2%, while rents increased 6.5%.

""As long as shelter inflation remains stubbornly elevated, the Fed will keep pushing back at the idea of imminent rate cuts,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in a note to clients following the Thursday data release.

Yet economists also said these increases are unlikely to last given other real-time measures of housing costs showing cooling price growth. In its most recent rental report, the real estate group Redfin said the median asking rent in the U.S. fell for the third-straight month in December to $1,964.

The decline came as landlords grappled with rising vacancies due to a post-pandemic building boom, Redfin said.

Indeed, there are signs consumers are starting to feel better about the economy — even though, to many of them, the prices they're experiencing still don't feel like a big improvement.

After two years of breakneck inflation that sent the cost of everyday goods and services surging, 2023 experienced a meaningful slowdown in price growth: the December 3.4% reading is down from the 6.4% growth seen in December 2022.

Thursday's reading is still above the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2%, and prices in most cases aren't actually reversing. As a result, the shell shock of the past 24 months for consumers is still wearing off.

“The good news is the rate of inflation has been steadily moderating and moving closer to the ultimate goal of 2%,” said Greg McBride, a vice president and the chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “The bad news is it doesn’t mean prices are actually falling — just that they’re not going up as fast.”

Two of the categories most affecting consumers — food at home and energy prices — have had more aggressive slowdowns in price growth than many other categories, McBride said. After hitting a high of 13.5% in August 2022, 12-month food price growth slowed to 1.3% in December, the BLS said Thursday.

And gas prices, which surged to almost $5 a gallon on average in June 2022, are now about $3 a gallon.

While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine produced an acute price surge for those two categories in 2021, McBride said their price growth has slowed thanks to a broader slowdown in economic growth — a trend that is likely to continue. The World Bank announced this week that it expects worldwide gross domestic product to hit just 2.4% this year, down from 2.6% in 2023, 3.0% in 2022 and 6.2% in 2021.

Yet, consumers still face everyday prices that are above pre-pandemic levels. White bread, which cost about $1.30 per pound in the winter of 2019-20, now costs about $2 per pound, according to BLS data. Ground beef has increased from about $3.87 a pound to $5.35 a pound over the same period. And a gallon of milk has climbed from roughly $3.20 to about $4.

So even as price growth continues to moderate, consumers are still adapting to a new normal.

“Consumer sentiment is still depressed overall,” said Matt Bush, the U.S. economist at Guggenheim Investments. “While the rate of inflation is slowing down, the absolute level is still really high — consumers are still unhappy with the level of prices.”

There are signs that consumer sentiment is slowly turning around now that wage growth has surpassed the rate of inflation.

Consumer confidence jumped in the final month of last year to its highest level since July. Data released Friday showed employers added 216,000 jobs in December, far more than expected, demonstrating the labor market remains robust even as it cools down.

Against that backdrop, some economists view even potentially concerning trends, like consumers’ ballooning debt burdens, as a sign that people are starting to feel a bit more optimistic as price pressures ease.

“They’re taking on additional debt because they expect to make more money,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consulting firm RSM. Consumer debt figures don’t always paint a full picture, in part because wealthier Americans tend to borrow and repay more money at faster rates, he said. But even so, many consumers “have the capacity to pay that debt back” despite higher interest rates on credit cards to mortgages and auto loans.

“In many ways, it’s an expression of confidence,” he added.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, said that even as wage growth slows, it should still continue to stay above inflation.

For consumers, that means real — if small — gains.

""With each passing month, it gets a teeny bit better,"" Zandi said. He continued: ""There's a slightly brighter hue in terms of people's responses. It's not an event; it’s a process — the feeling that wages are outpacing inflation, that purchasing power [is] improving. That’s what’s happening, but it will take a while to convince to people it’s real and sustainable."""
Jan 10 2024,New Labor Department rule would classify more workers in ‘gig economy’ jobs as employees,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2790488/biden-rule-gig-economy-workers-returns-to-obama-policies/,"The Biden administration implemented a new rule on Tuesday that will tighten standards for when “gig economy” workers at companies like Uber, Lyft, and Grubhub must be considered employees who are entitled to labor protections rather than independent contractors.

The Labor Department finalized a new rule that will replace a Trump-era standard that narrowed the criteria for classifying workers as employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

“Misclassifying employees as independent contractors is a serious issue that deprives workers of basic rights and protections,” acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su said in a press statement. “This rule will help protect workers, especially those facing the greatest risk of exploitation, by making sure they are classified properly and that they receive the wages they’ve earned.”

Contractor status means the people in question would not receive protections related to overtime pay and minimum wages. The new rule has been anticipated by labor advocates but received pushback from gig economy employers such as Uber and Lyft.

“This rule does not materially change the law under which we operate, and won’t impact the classification of the over one million Americans who turn to Uber to make money flexibly,” Uber’s head of federal affairs, CR Wooters, said in a prepared statement.

“This new guidance creates additional complexities and ambiguities for companies and courts alike across the country,” Lyft said in a blog post.

The Department of Labor set relaxed criteria for what is considered a contractor in 2021 by only focusing on two of the six criteria used by the department to determine if a staffer is a contractor. The new rule will now have Labor focus on all six criteria when considering whether an employee is a contractor.

These six criteria include whether the employee can make a profit based on their managerial skills, whether the employee had to invest in the company, the permanence of the relationship, how much control the company has over the employee’s operations, the skill level of the employee, and additional factors.

One complexity will be how it relates to different states. The rules won’t override California’s policies on contractors, for example, which are significantly more restrictive than those of other states.

The rule is also expected to increase costs for some industries, including trucking and retail.

It could also lead to more restrictive policies on contractors in the future. “Depending upon how the political winds blow, this could mark the beginning of much stricter regulation of the gig economy by the [Department of Labor],” Aaron Goldstein, a labor lawyer with Dorsey & Whitney, told the Washington Examiner in an email.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said on Tuesday that he would introduce a resolution to repeal the rule, arguing that it is an example of the Biden administration “prioritizing unions over Americans who choose to earn a living without participating in a union.”

The policy will go into effect on March 11."

Jan 03 2024,"What's ahead for the US economy and job growth? A peek at inflation, interest rates, more",USA TODAY,left,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/02/2024-economic-outlook-brightens/72055290007/,"The post-COVID-19 economy was finally supposed to stop defying gravity and topple into a recession this year.

Instead, the stock market is roaring on the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is on track to wrestle down inflation without causing a downturn, a rare feat known as a “soft landing.”

To be sure, growth is expected to slow amid the delayed effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes, the depletion of households’ excess pandemic savings and a pullback in federal government spending.

But other factors are likely to keep the economy afloat, forecasters say, including near-record home and stock prices, a further easing of inflation to or near the Fed’s 2% goal and the central bank’s tentative plans to cut interest rates more sharply than previously anticipated.

“2023 was a very good year,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “2024 will just be a good year.”

Will the Fed lower interest rates in 2024?

A flurry of developments in recent weeks has brightened the outlook. The Fed said it’s probably done hiking rates to fight inflation and is penciling in three rate cuts in 2024, a strategy that would lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Inflation has slowed more dramatically than expected, validating the Fed’s turnabout.

And a stock market that was already surging on an improved inflation picture rocketed higher after the Fed’s pivot.

“It was like pouring gasoline on a fire that was already burning,” Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist of BMO, wrote in a note to clients.

What will the economy be like in 2024?

Forecasters expect the economy to grow 1.3% this year, down from a projected 2.4% in 2023 but above their 0.7% estimate in July, according to a survey by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators. Meager gains in the first half of the year should give way to stronger output by fall as the Fed slices rates further, forecasters say.

The 3.7% unemployment rate – modestly above a 50-year low − is projected to rise to 4.2% by the end of 2024, well below economists’ 4.8% estimate a year ago.

Keep in mind the Wolters Kluwer poll was conducted in early December, before the Fed news on Dec. 13.

Some top economists have since revised their estimates. Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial, has bumped up his GDP growth forecast to 1.9% from 1.6%. Zandi, who says he always believed inflation would retreat and the Fed would shift its stance, is sticking to his 1.8% prediction.

GDP growth of just under 2% is far from robust but it would be close to the decent 2% average in the decade before the pandemic. Normally, a big drop in inflation requires a dramatically cooling economy as softer consumer and business demand leads companies to lower prices and employees to accept smaller pay raises.

But nothing has been normal about the post-pandemic economy, which vaulted 5.8% in 2021 as it emerged from the COVID-19 recession. The boom came with product and worker shortages that sent prices soaring. But inflation is now easing as those supply driven troubles unwind – even without a big drop in demand. Economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics calls the development “almost unprecedented.”

What are the top economic threats?

There are risks.

Inflation could fall more gradually than expected, prompting the Fed to keep its key rate higher for longer. That could hamper growth and possibly even nudge the nation into recession or ""stagflation,"" a toxic mix of a weak economy and high inflation, Ashworth says. The delayed impact from the Fed’s 5.25 percentage points in rate hikes since early 2022 – the most in 40 years – could hobble the economy more than believed.

And global shipping snarls resulting from military conflict in the Red Sea could push prices still higher.

But there’s also a chance that inflation tumbles more rapidly, spurring the Fed to trim rates sooner and faster so that inflation-adjusted rates don’t increase, Goldman Sachs says. Futures markets are forecasting six quarter-point rate cuts in 2024, double the Fed’s estimate.

“We see the upside and downside risks as balanced,” Moody of Regions says. “Previously, we saw the downside risks as dominant.”

In other words, an economy that sizzles again now appears just as likely as one that slumps.

How different parts of the economy are likely to perform in 2024:

Consumer spending

American shoppers have more than done their part to sustain an economy fueled mostly by their purchases. But their pent-up demand from the pandemic is fading and their savings from federal stimulus checks and hunkering down at home are dwindling, Moody says, especially for low- and middle-income consumers.

Those households also have built up record credit card debt to cope with high prices, curtailing their spending even as banks tighten lending standards, says Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon.

Meanwhile, Daco says, job and wage growth are set to slow as the economy cools, providing consumers less cash to spend. High interest rates also should constrain spending, at least until the Fed starts cutting.

But there are also encouraging signs.

Average annual wage growth is set to fall from 4% toward the Fed’s 3.5% target, but inflation will likely come down even more rapidly, Zandi says. That, he says, should give households more purchasing power.

And recently strong growth in productivity – or output per worker – could allow employers to keep doling out healthy raises without hurting profits, Zandi says.

Although low- and moderate-income Americans are squeezed, higher-income consumers have more pandemic savings and are benefiting from near-record home and stock prices, Zandi says, making them feel wealthier and prompting them to splurge. The top third of income earners account for nearly two-thirds of overall spending while the bottom third make up a tenth, Zandi says.

The bottom line?

Consumer spending should rise 1.4% in 2024 following 2.2% growth last year, according to the Wolters Kluwer survey. Zandi expects a stronger 2% gain.

Job growth

Slower consumer spending and a cooling economy should reduce average monthly job gains from a projected 216,000 in 2023 to just 53,000 this year, according to Zandi.

Moody and Goldman Sachs are more sanguine, predicting monthly additions will average about 100,000 – enough to keep the 3.7% unemployment rate from rising.

Zandi agrees there’s a chance payroll growth could be stronger if immigration stays robust instead of declining as expected. That would continue to boost the labor supply and hiring while keeping a lid on pay increases and inflation.

Some hot industries plan to hire lots of workers this year.

Point in Time Studios, a video production company that specializes in virtual reality and 3D animation, expects sales to grow 75%, in part, because of the artificial intelligence frenzy, says company President Rami Kalla. He says the company, based in Tempe, Arizona, will add up to 10 employees to a staff of 25.

And Healthy Technology Solutions, which provides computer systems and services to hospitals and high-end builders, will add four or five employees to its 12-person staff, says Leo Bletnitsky, president of the Las Vegas-based company.

“When all the (large) tech companies were laying people off, it made (job candidates) a lot more available,” he says.

But Robert Brill, CEO of Brill Media, a Los Angeles-based digital advertising company, says sales were down the past two years after soaring in 2021. Higher borrowing costs, he says, have made many businesses wary of taking on new projects.

“I think companies are becoming way more frugal,” Brill says, noting he expects that to change when the Fed lowers rates. For now, he has no plans to add to his 20 staffers.

Inflation

Morgan Stanley reckons the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure, which strips out volatile food and energy items, will fall to 2.4% by the end of the year, from 3.2% in November and a high of 7% in mid-2022. Ashworth predicts it will drift close to the Fed’s 2% target by mid-year, prompting officials to start shaving rates in March.

But Morgan Stanley says rent hikes, the largest contributor to inflation, will fall slowly, keeping inflation elevated longer and delaying the Fed’s first rate cut to June.

Government spending

The Biden Administration’s sweeping legislation to encourage infrastructure, green energy and computer chip development in the U.S. has pumped billions into the economy. But spending cuts are expected in 2024 as part of Congress’s November deal to avert a government shutdown.

Zandi expects a 4% decline in non-defense spending following a 4.8% rise in 2023.

Business investment

While high interest rates will likely dampen business capital spending in the first half of 2024, falling Fed rates could spark a rebound later in the year, economists say.

Broadly, businesses will invest in equipment and structures to the extent consumers keep buying their products and services, Zandi says.

He expects business investment to rise but at less than half of 2023's 4.4% pace.

Housing

Single-family housing starts were weak last year, mostly because of mortgage rates that approached 8%.

But rates recently fell below 7%. And with existing homeowners reluctant to sell because they would have to buy another house at a much higher mortgage rate, demand for new homes is strong.

After hurting economic growth last year, housing should provide a boost in 2024, says Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group."
Jan 09 2024,"""Desperate"" Trump says he wants the economy to crash this year — because it will give him a boost",Salon,left,https://salon.com/2024/01/09/desperate-says-he-wants-the-economy-to-crash-this-year--because-it-will-give-him-a-boost,"Donald Trump during a Monday interview with Lindell TV said he hopes for an economic crash because he thinks it will boost his chances of winning the 2024 presidential election. The former president sat down with Lou Dobbs, a former Fox host whose show was axed in 2021 over Dobbs’s intense MAGA fervor. During the interview, Dobbs asked Trump to disclose his plans for how he would “restore primacy” for those who are “fighting for their economic and their real survival.” Trump replied by discussing the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, which would run between Nebraska and Alberta, Canada, though President Joe Biden revoked the pipeline’s permit once he assumed office. “That’s one of just so many different things,” Trump said of the pipeline. “So what we will be doing is we will be drilling, we will be reducing energy, that will bring down inflation, that will bring down interest rates.”

“We have an economy that is incredible,” Trump added. “We have an economy that is so fragile. And the only reason it’s running now is it’s running off the fumes of what we did—what the Trump administration did. It’s just running off the fumes.” He continued: “And when there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during these next twelve months, because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover,” referencing the acting president during the Great Depression. “The one president—I just don’t want to be Herbert Hoover.”

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough took sharp issue with Trump’s remarks about the economy, using them as fodder for why he should not be permitted to once again run for office. ""What you have to love is that he's once again exposed himself to show just how horrific of a public servant he would be,"" the “Morning Joe” host said. ""This is a guy that admitted on television, because he's so focused on himself, that he wants Americans to hurry up and lose their jobs. He wants them to lose their savings, he wants them to lose their 401(k)s. Yes, he wants their retirement accounts to be shattered over the next 12 months. He's that desperate to be elected."" Scarborough continued by asserting that “economists from left to right” will claim the economy is stronger than it has been in recent years. “It's more resilient than they ever expected it to be,” he added. “This economy, you even had conservatives, you had [Wall Street Journal editor] Gerard Baker, no fan of Joe Biden, saying one of the big winners of 2023 last year was the United States economy. It is strong."""

Where they stand on the economy, crime and the border",CalMatters,center,https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/01/us-senate-california-candidates/,"In summary The five major contenders have different track records and proposals on some of the biggest issues facing California. They’re trying to position themselves to appeal to sizable voting blocs before the March 5 primary.

Lea este artículo en español.

The main contenders to become California’s new U.S. senator want voters to see them in a certain light:



Rep. Adam Schiff as a defender of democracy; Rep. Katie Porter as an anti-corruption crusader; Rep. Barbara Lee as a courageous progressive; Eric Early as a champion for the “forgotten Americans;” and Steve Garvey as a commonsense consensus builder.

But their ads, slogans and speeches offer only a glimpse into who they are, or what they have done — or plan to do — to tackle some of Californians’ most pressing concerns. All three Democrats have years of voting records while serving in Congress.

All but Early are set to debate for the first time in this race on Monday evening. Ahead of the event, CalMatters sent each campaign a questionnaire and analyzed their records and stances on issues such as border, immigration, criminal justice, foreign policy, economy, labor and housing.

Here’s a detailed look at where they stand on those issues — and how they differ from each other:

Border and immigration

The three Democrats share a similar track record on immigration and border security issues.

They all voted against Republican proposals to bar federally-funded housing to migrants, limit asylum eligibility and condemn the use of public school facilities to shelter migrants. They have all supported — or even co-sponsored — bills to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and their children, establish independent oversight on border security activities and limit the president’s ability to restrict undocumented immigrant entries.

All support expanding unemployment insurance benefits to undocumented immigrants seeking work.

At a November immigration forum, all three Democrats criticized President Joe Biden’s policy that banned most migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border illegally. Porter said the policy was “dishonoring this nation’s history and our future.” Schiff and Lee both called it “wrong.”

Biden — noting that previous congressional actions tied his hands — decided to continue building former President Donald Trump’s Mexican border wall in October, shocking some Democrats. The decision drew instant criticism from Lee, who urged White House to reverse course in a tweet.

Lee, Schiff and Porter all agreed a generic border wall is ineffective in response to CalMatters’ questionnaire this month. Schiff and Porter both advocated for increased use of detection technologies at the border.

Porter, however, said some “site-specific” barriers do work, “for example, in dangerous areas where the lives of migrants and U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel are at risk when there are unauthorized crossings and search and rescue missions.”

Of the three Democrats, Lee appears to be the most staunch critic of allocating more funds to federal border patrol agencies.

In 2019, Lee voted against authorizing a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid and security funding package at the southern border, while Schiff and Porter voted in favor. The package — backed by Republicans and moderate Democrats — passed the House without the stronger protections in migrant facilities that House progressives had supported.

Lee called for a 50% budget cut for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in statements to CalMatters. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security, she said, would be better spent on “meaningful immigration reform.”

“ICE is rotten to the core,” Lee said in response to the CalMatters questionnaire. She is the only Senate candidate to have voted against creating the agency in 2002, when Schiff — then in his first term — supported it.

Porter told CalMatters she generally does not support additional funding for the agency, but said she wants border patrol employees to “receive pay commensurate with their work” to help “recruit a workforce that can meet the needs of our border communities.”

Schiff said Congress should provide aid to border communities and increase resources and personnel at ports of entry to help handle an influx of asylum seekers.

The top two Republicans — Garvey and Early — both support the border wall, additional funding for border patrol agents and tightened restrictions on border entries. Both said the nation should prioritize immigration applications from people legally present in the United States and both oppose offering undocumented immigrants unemployment benefits.

Early argued he supports a path to citizenship for “illegal immigrants who have enlisted in and participated honorably in our military.” Currently, non-citizens can only join the military if they are legal permanent residents, but a Democrats-backed bill in Congress would allow undocumented DREAMers to serve in the military.

Garvey visited the Mexico border as one of his first campaign events last month and said he wants to complete the wall.

Crime and guns

On this topic, the Republican and Democratic candidates seem to share some common ground.

They have all stressed the need to invest in mental health services as well as policing to address crime, but the devil’s in the details.

The three Democrats want more funding to reform policing methods. They all voted for de-escalation training for police, more federal dollars for violence intervention initiatives and restricting police use of chokeholds after George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.

Garvey and Early’s campaigns called for more funding for police departments and law enforcement officers, as well as the need to secure the southern border.

All three Democrats support boosting funding for mental health treatment programs. Lee — arguing poverty is the root cause of crime — believes raising the minimum wage, expanding access to healthcare and legalizing marijuana will address the “structural problems” that lead to criminal acts, her campaign says.

Porter’s campaign championed her Mental Health Justice Act — a 2022 bill to give grants to governments to recruit and train mental health professionals to respond to emergency calls. Schiff and Lee both voted for the measure.

Garvey’s campaign said he also supports funding to treat mental health problems and drug addiction, arguing they often contribute to gun violence and homelessness. Early, via a campaign spokesperson, advocated for a “rebuild” of the nation’s mental health system “that allows for the severely mentally ill to be permanently housed and cared for,” arguing that services were “decimated” in the 1960s — when people were discharged from institutions and placed in community-based care centers amid the civil rights movement.

On gun policies, Garvey supports “common-sense measures” such as pre-sale background checks and an assault weapon ban — something mainly supported by Democrats, according to his campaign. “We can keep guns out of the hands of criminals while also protecting Second Amendment rights,” his campaign said in a response to CalMatters’ questions.

The candidates are otherwise split along party lines. For example, all three Democrats oppose the federal death penalty, while Republicans argue the opposite.

But there are nuanced differences, especially among Democrats. They all voted against legislation to permanently raise fentanyl-related drugs to the highest class of illegal substances — a GOP-led bill Biden urged Congress to pass. Lee, however, was the only candidate to vote against even temporarily doing so.

Schiff — a former prosecutor in Los Angeles — has the most controversial track record on criminal justice issues due to his past support for tough-on-crime policies.

Schiff was among 48 Democrats to support the Thin Blue Line Act in 2017 to apply the federal death penalty to cop killers — something Early supports. Schiff has since publicly spoken against the sentence. In his campaign response to CalMatters, Schiff credited his change of heart to “technological advancements” that revealed “deep flaws” with the death penalty and a “disproportionate application” of the sentence on people of color.

As a state senator, Schiff authored legislation to crack down on juveniles, including a bill to create year-long “boot camps” for teenagers found in possession of marijuana at school and another to try kids 14 years and older as adults if they commit murder or rape.

In Congress, he introduced legislation in 2009 to increase funding to a controversial program to place more cops in communities, supported language to exclude asylum seekers and immigrants from privacy protections and voted for the Protect and Serve Act in 2018 to impose stricter penalties on assaulting law enforcement officers, which most Democrats voted for. Lee voted against both measures.

Schiff’s record irked criminal justice activists, who in a 2021 letter urged Gov. Gavin Newsom not to appoint Schiff as the next state attorney general. He has since softened some of his positions on criminal justice. In February 2023, he said his viewpoint had changed since the 1990s. “I’ve learned that some of the policies of the 90s didn’t work,” he told ABC7 last year.

Foreign policy and defense

The issue of a ceasefire in the Gaza war highlights a key split among the three Democratic hopefuls.

A day after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Lee called for a permanent ceasefire from the stage of a Senate candidate debate — one of the first members of Congress to do so. Schiff called for “unequivocal support” for Israel, while Porter cautioned against Islamophobia and mourned the lives lost on both sides.

For months afterward, as the casualty numbers rose in Gaza, Schiff and Porter both called for a “humanitarian pause” — aligning with the Biden administration’s policy. But as calls for a permanent ceasefire grew, Porter shifted her stance in a Dec. 18 statement, calling for a “lasting bilateral ceasefire” that “brings remaining hostages home, secures Israel’s safety, removes Hamas from operational control of Gaza, and invests in creating a better economic and political architecture for Palestinians in Gaza.”

When asked to explain why she shifted her stance, Porter’s campaign pointed to her Dec. 18 statement, in which she seemed to suggest Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of Palestinian governance of Gaza was the reason.

“His remarks and actions necessitate tough conversations with our ally Israel about its long-term strategy and among U.S. policymakers about our approach in the Middle East,” she said in the statement.

Schiff, however, has stood by his initial position, arguing that a permanent ceasefire would “perpetuate Hamas terrorist control of Gaza,” according to his campaign.

All three Democrats signed on as co-sponsors of a largely symbolic bipartisan House resolution affirming Israel’s right to defend itself. But Lee was the only candidate to vote against the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act — a bipartisan bill that would sanction Hamas, its affiliates and governments providing aid to the group.

“The bill was opposed by major humanitarian organizations because it is overly broad and will hurt a lot of innocent Palestinians by making it harder if not impossible to receive humanitarian assistance,” Lee spokesperson Sean Ryan told CalMatters in an email.

Decades before Gaza, Lee shocked the world by being the lone vote against the Afghanistan war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a decision that got her death threats then but now hailed as a show of courage by her supporters.

Lee is still somewhat of a unicorn on foreign policy compared to her opponents.

In 2002, Lee voted against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, while Schiff voted in favor. Lee has since sponsored a resolution to repeal the authorization most years; it wasn’t until 2021 that the House passed it, with Schiff and Porter both voting in favor.

Lee was also the only candidate to support a U.S. troop removal from Syria in March 2023 — a measure most Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, voted against. Critics of the bill said a removal could give Islamic State terrorists time to reorganize, the Associated Press reported.

Additionally, Lee touts herself as the most consistent in calling for cutting the nation’s “bloated” defense budget. She has voted against authorizing defense and military spending when Schiff and Porter voted in favor, voting records show.

Schiff’s campaign said he wants to reduce the Pentagon’s budget by 10% and supports eliminating weapons systems the administration does not need or want. “There is far too much waste in the defense budget that must be eliminated,” his campaign said.

Porter’s campaign said the funding level needs to be indexed to national security threats and there needs to be more oversight. “I’ll never rubber stamp spending, but I believe investing in our servicemembers and their well-being is paramount,” the campaign said.

Both Republicans support increasing the defense budget. Neither Garvey nor Early supported a call for a ceasefire. They both argued Israel must have the ability to fight Hamas until it is destroyed, their campaigns said.

Economy and labor

Although far lower than during the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation remains high, jumping from 3.1% to 3.4% in December. Experts attribute it to the rising cost of housing, and project it’s unlikely to last given a housing market cool-down, NBC reported.

Republican candidates blame the Biden administration. Garvey attributed it to “excessive government spending” while Early criticized the reduction of domestic energy production — a GOP talking point that conflicts with record-high U.S. oil production in October.

Democrats slam corporations instead. Porter — a self-proclaimed warrior taking on Wall Street interests — argued inflation worsened because businesses are overcharging customers, pointing to record-high profits for big corporations. Similarly, Lee blamed corporate greed. Apart from corporate profit, Schiff pointed to the supply chain interruption during the pandemic and a lack of housing as contributing factors.

Among the three Democrats, Schiff — a past member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition — has historically been the most skeptical of federal spending. In 2005, he demanded a “rainy-day” reserve in the budget.

Schiff is the only Senate candidate to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling last year to avoid a default. Lee and Porter — along with 38 other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — voted against it. Lee said she voted to stand up against “extreme MAGA Republicans holding our economy hostage,” and Porter — who has argued the debt ceiling should be abolished — criticized the measure for including “giveaways” to the oil and gas industry, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Schiff, who applied to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus last year but withdrew, voted multiple times against the “People’s Budget” — which contains all the caucus’ priorities and which has served as a purity test. Lee — the only other candidate in Congress at the time — voted in favor.

Lee is also the only candidate to sponsor the Curtail Executive Overcompensation Act, a measure increasing taxes on corporate CEOs. Lee and Porter are both sponsoring the Oligarch Act, another measure aimed to tax the rich, while Schiff is not. Schiff has, however, expressed support for repealing tax cuts for the wealthy made under the Trump administration.

All three Democrats have gained union endorsements, although Schiff has won the most from statewide unions. All the Democrats support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act to override all state right-to-work laws and strengthen union protections. Garvey and Early both said that the decision belongs to states, not the federal government, according to their campaigns.

The five candidates also split along party lines on whether striking workers should be eligible for unemployment benefits — a controversial bill vetoed by Gov. Newsom last year. All three Democrats said those workers deserve the benefits. Early outright said no, while Garvey’s campaign told CalMatters that governments should stay out of disputes between unions and businesses.

All three Democrats believe the federal minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — should increase.

Lee called for a $50 hourly minimum wage during a forum last year, noting that’s the living wage one working adult with two children would have to make, according to an Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate.

Porter’s campaign said she supports a $20 federal minimum wage and $25 for California, indexed to inflation. Schiff’s campaign said he supports a $20 federal minimum wage indexed to inflation, with a boost to $25 for health care workers.

Early believes the federal rate does not need to change and that an increase would worsen inflation, according to his campaign.

Garvey, on the other hand, did not give a specific number. “Each state and its voters have the ability to raise their minimum wage, as California has multiple times, beyond the federal minimum wage,” his campaign said.

Homelessness and housing

On California’s worsening homelessness crisis, Republican candidates say mental health problems are the main culprit — not the lack of affordable housing.

Early, in his campaign’s response to CalMatters’ questions, said the cause of the state’s homelessness is “severe mental illness” and “soft-on-crime” policies, referring to Proposition 47 — a ballot measure passed in 2014 that reduced penalties for certain thefts and drug offenses.

“The biggest factor is manifestly not insufficient low-income housing,” the campaign’s statement read.

Garvey’s campaign said the biggest driving factors of the problem are “drug and alcohol addiction” and “mental health issues.” During a Wednesday visit to a Sacramento homeless encampment, he said he wants a “deep dive” into how taxpayer dollars are spent to battle the homelessness crisis.

But the Democratic candidates all argued a lack of affordable housing is driving the crisis.

The homelessness problem is a “direct result” of failed federal housing policies over the past decades, Porter argues on her website. Her campaign said she supports a “major investment” in housing, including a fully-funded federal Section 8 program and an expansion of the national Low Income Housing Tax Credit.

Lee’s campaign said homelessness is a housing issue “at its core.” Like Porter, she also called for a fully-funded Section 8 program and a national rent control standard — one that the Biden administration has pushed for. She believes expanding health care access, offering free college and raising the minimum wage would help ease homelessness in the state, her campaign said. She also touted legislation she introduced to help renters, such as the DEPOSIT Act, which would allow federal programs to cover security deposit and moving expenses for those using the Housing Choice vouchers.

Similarly, Schiff’s campaign said he also supports expanding Section 8 vouchers and providing wraparound services. Additionally, his campaign stressed the importance of easing regulations and offering tax incentives to encourage the build-out of affordable housing — something Garvey and Early also support.

On Schiff’s campaign website, he touted legislation he introduced and supported to fight homelessness, including the Affordable and Homeless Housing Incentive Act, which would offer tax incentives for homeless shelters.

Asked if they support more federal funding to combat the crisis, only Early’s campaign said no. Garvey’s campaign said funding for housing should prioritize projects in “low-income areas, and near job and transit centers.”

Schiff and Lee have both touted their success securing earmarked funds for housing and homelessness. Porter, however, is a staunch opponent of earmark requests, arguing the funding goes to lawmakers’ “pet projects” and requests should be rejected. She has signed onto letters instead, urging her colleagues to approve grants to homelessness assistance programs."

Dec 08 2023,"The US economy added 199,000 jobs in November",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/economy/november-jobs-report-final/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN —

The US economy notched another solid month of job growth, with an added lift from actors and autoworkers coming off the picket lines.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.

“The economy’s still humming along,” Jane Oates, a former Department of Labor official who is president of employment education nonprofit WorkingNation, told CNN. “For the past two weeks, all we’ve heard is doom and gloom about how this is going to be a terrible day. And it was a much better day than was predicted.”

Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady, according to Refinitiv.

The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 62.8%, returning to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate increase is a “positive underlying context to the unemployment rate decline,” wrote Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, in commentary issued Friday.

One-time boosts

The largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated 93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing saw a boost, too, largely because of the return of striking autoworkers, which lifted motor vehicles and parts employment by 30,000 jobs.

Additionally, the resolution of the Screen Actors Guild strike against Hollywood studios resulted in 17,200 jobs added in the motion picture and sound recording industries.

In total, the BLS was anticipating a net gain of 35,000 workers returning after strikes: The agency estimated that 61,000 workers were absent from the labor market due to labor disputes, versus 96,000 the month before.

Taking into account those one-time gains, the underlying rate of job growth is likely around 160,000 jobs per month, which aligns with the 2019 average, wrote Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter.

November’s jobs number is in line with the strong monthly gains hit in the decade before the pandemic, when 183,000 jobs per month were added. The current rate of job growth also is well above the “neutral rate,” or what’s needed to keep up with population growth.

“It is critical to put this data in the proper context,” Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist of RSM US, wrote in a note on Friday. “Given long-term demographic changes and structural transformation of the US economy to keep employment stable, only 75,000 jobs per month need to be created, in contrast with the roughly 200,000 that was the case just over a decade ago.”

Retail drop-off

The biggest declines occurred in the retail trade and temporary help services sectors, which lost 38,400 jobs and 13,600 jobs, respectively.

“The [reason for the] reduction of jobs in retail is very similar to the reduction of jobs in other places, except retail hasn’t been able to absorb — and that’s technology,” Oates said.

As e-commerce and in-store pick-ups become more engrained in how people shop, that leads to fewer people needed at the brick-and-mortar level.

What this means for the Fed

November’s job growth was stronger than October’s unrevised tally of 150,000 jobs added. September’s job gains were revised down to 262,000 from 297,000, according to the BLS.

The continued strength in the labor market has helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth, but Federal Reserve officials believe slower demand (and slower wage growth) will help bring down inflation.

Friday’s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in November from the month before, showing a more accelerated pace of growth than the 0.2% uptick seen in October and the 0.3% expected by economists.

On an annual basis, however, wage gains eased to 4% from the 4.1% rate seen a month before.

Through November, the economy has added an average of 232,000 jobs per month — far more moderate growth than 2022 and 2021, when an estimated 399,000 and 606,000 jobs were added every month, respectively.

Friday’s strong jobs report likely keeps the Fed’s options open, although cooling inflation should mean that another pause is in store when the central bank meets next week, wrote Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist.

“Labor market endurance will lead Fed officials to retain some optionality for future rate hikes, if needed,” she wrote. “We expect policymakers will resist talking about rate cuts until early 2024.”"
Dec 28 2023,"Housing, inflation, interest rates and more: What to expect in the 2024 economy",NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/what-expect-2024-economy-buying-house-inflation-recession-rcna130790,"A slowdown — but no recession.

That's the broad consensus for the economy among experts as we head into 2024. After a post-pandemic period that saw growth surpass most forecasts — but also spurred breakneck inflation — Americans should now expect a period of reduced business activity.

Yet while some economists believe the risk of a recession will remain, others think a ""soft landing"" is more likely. That oft-talked-about scenario is understood as a combination of milder inflation alongside slow-and-steady employment growth.

""There's more hope for it [a soft landing] going into 2024 than there had been heading into 2023,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.

The forecast among many economists for a recession in 2023 did not come to pass. Indeed, from a purely data-driven perspective, history may consider this year to be a good one, as low unemployment and rapidly declining inflation prevailed.

Today, the unemployment rate stands at 3.7% — little changed from the 3.5% seen one year ago. The annual rate of inflation, meanwhile, has fallen to 3.1%, less than half of the 7.1% rate seen in November 2022.

As a result, consumer confidence has grown. In the most recent survey by the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization, good economic vibes among consumers rocketed to the highest reading since July.

Warning signs on the horizon

With additional context, each of these measures point to a slowdown on the horizon. The unemployment rate is up from the 3.4% low reached in April. And despite coming off the near double-digit highs in June 2022, inflation has not been able to break below 3%. In fact, it has bounced around in that 3% range for six consecutive months.

As for consumer confidence, it is still well below the post-pandemic high recorded in the spring of 2021.

Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the unemployment rate is likely to increase to around 4% as consumers pull back on spending, causing job growth to slow.

But while the risk of recession remains ""elevated,"" it likely won't occur unless there is a negative shock to the global economy, like wider conflict in the Middle East, where Israel is at war with Hamas fighters in Gaza, Faucher said.

""It [a recession] is less likely now than it was three or six months ago, just because of the ongoing strength we've seen,"" Faucher added.

The economy has already slowed thanks to high interest rates, something consumers will continue to encounter in 2024, Bankrate’s McBride said. The Federal Reserve has kept rates elevated in its ongoing effort to wrestle inflation, and it isn't likely to reduce them anytime soon.

Right now, credit card interest rates continue to average more than 20%. And even though mortgage rates are just starting to decline, the average 30-year interest rate still hovers around 6.5% to 7% — and even higher in certain faster-growing regions of the country. That range is about the same for car loans, too.

""Interest rates took the elevator going up, but are going to take the stairs coming down,"" McBride said. While some Federal Reserve officials have begun to signal they would be open to cutting rates next year, McBride said they would come down ""at a very modest rate.""

""We're going to be in a high-interest-rate environment for some time,"" he said.

Still, many consumers have weathered this environment, and will continue to do so next year, experts say.

In commentary released this week, Bank of America economists said ""net wealth"" has grown for many Americans, thanks to higher home prices and a banner year for the stock market. This will continue to fuel a healthy rate of purchasing, they said.

""Understanding the consumer continues to be more about 'watch what I do and not what I say,'"" the economists wrote, suggesting that shoppers are still comfortable with spending money even as they express concerns about the economy.

The economists added that recent retail sales reports indicate holiday spending this year ""was more favorable than many expected,"" while total hours worked have continued to expand.

Of course, this sunnier scenario of staying afloat financially without much difficulty does not apply to all Americans. The Bank of America economists note that when it comes to how savings and housing affordability have been distributed since the pandemic, many households are far from well-off.

And Bankrate's McBride estimates that some 60% of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck.

Yet overall, ""it appears the U.S. consumer is cooling, not retrenching,"" the Bank of America economists said."
Jan 09 2024,"Global economy headed for worst half-decade in 30 years, World Bank warns",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/09/world-bank-global-economy/,"The global economy will slow in 2024 for the third straight year and appears headed for its weakest half-decade since the early 1990s, the World Bank said Tuesday in its latest annual forecast. While higher interest rates appear to be bringing inflation under control without the serious financial crisis or soaring unemployment that many had feared, the global economy’s overall performance is lagging, said Indermit Gill, the bank’s top economist.

After rebounding sharply in 2021 from the depths of the pandemic, the global economy grew by 3 percent in 2022, dipped to a 2.6 percent rate last year and is expected to post a tepid 2.4 percent this year, the bank said in its annual Global Economic Prospects report. Those rates lag the 3.1 percent average for the decade of the 2010s.

The continuing slowdown all but guarantees that world leaders will fail to meet the 2030 development goals that 193 members of the United Nations, including the United States, agreed to in 2015. Governments pledged to transform the global economy by the end of this decade by setting 17 ambitious aims, including eliminating extreme poverty, cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half, boosting education for the poor and eradicating hunger.

The measures were not legally binding. But resulting from three years of negotiations, and introduced at the United Nations with an address from Pope Francis, they were seen as packing a moral punch.

“The 2020s have so far been a period of broken promises. Governments across the world have fallen short of the ‘unprecedented’ goals they promised to meet by 2020,” Gill wrote in a foreword to the report, which labeled the outlook “wretched.”

In a quarter of the world’s developing countries, people are poorer today than they were before the pandemic, the bank said.

“When you look at the big picture, it’s not pleasant,” said Ayhan Kose, the bank’s deputy chief economist.

Still, the bank celebrated progress in bringing inflation under control, as supply chain kinks were ironed out and higher borrowing costs cooled business activity. Globally, inflation is expected to average 3.7 percent this year, down from 5.3 percent in 2023.

But prices are likely to continue rising faster than central banks such as the Federal Reserve say is advisable well into this year.

“I suggest we don’t pop the champagne yet,” Kose said.

The bank’s forecast calls for the United States to grow at a 1.6 percent rate this year, roughly twice as fast as Europe or Japan. China is expected to grow by 4.5 percent, down from an estimated 5.2 percent last year as its post-covid reopening fades.

In the long run, slowing growth is a problem for advanced economies and middle-income countries alike. One reason for anemic growth in the latter is a sharp drop in investment spending, which is running at barely half the average rate seen in the past two decades.

By implementing policy changes such as expanded trade and capital flows and government budget discipline, developing countries could fuel an investment boom, the bank said, citing historical examples. In 192 episodes since 1950, countries such as Chile, Colombia and Turkey increased annual economic growth rates by almost one-third thanks to sharply higher spending on new plants and equipment.

In such periods, developing countries expanded their economies by around 40 percent over six years, the report said.

While bank economists expect a good-but-not-great year, they warned that conditions are more likely to disappoint than to produce a positive surprise. The war in Gaza — coupled with ongoing hostilities in Ukraine — could sideswipe global growth. Escalation of the fighting in the Middle East would probably send oil prices well above their current $75-per-barrel level, dampening growth and lifting inflation.

Attacks on shipping through the Red Sea have prompted cargo vessels to take the longer, costlier route around the southern tip of Africa. Over the 10 days ending Jan. 2, the volume of trade through the Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, dropped 28 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund."

Dec 27 2023,"Gov. Kelly announces Kansas economy grows 9.7% in fall 2023, fastest in nation",WIBW 13,center,https://wibw.com/2023/12/27/gov-kelly-announces-kansas-economy-grows-97-fall-2023-fastest-nation,"TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Governor Laura Kelly announced Kansas economy grew by 9.7% in the third quarter of 2023, which was the fastest rate in the nation.

Officials with the Office of the Governor said according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), this improves on an already impressive record of economic growth. In the second quarter, Kansas’ economy grew at the second-fastest rate in the nation at 7.4%.

“This data shows that our efforts to support businesses, create a stable economy, and grow our workforce are paying off,” Governor Kelly said. “Now, Kansas is outstripping the entire nation in economic growth and attracting business investment. Last week, I announced Kansas surpassed $18 billion in business investment since I took office in 2019. It’s clear we have the momentum to continue this trajectory of economic success into 2024 and beyond.”

Officials with the Office of the Governor indicated the Kelly Administration’s work to support the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industries helped drive this economic growth. While those industries decreased nationally and in 33 other states, they were leading contributions to growth in Kansas.

In addition, Kansas also ranked third in the nation for the growth in personal income, with personal income growing at 4.9% over the 3rd quarter of 2023. Farming, which decreased nationally and in 41 other states, was the leading contributor to the increased earnings in Kansas.

Office of the Governor officials said Kansas’ economic growth is measured by the change in its real gross domestic product (GDP), or the market value of goods and services produced in the state.

Sep 26 2023,Will the economy finally un-weird itself?,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/2023/9/25/23889590/economy-risks-jobs-government-shutdown-uaw-strikes-student-loans-inflation,"Let’s get this out of the way: the economy is not in bad shape at the moment.

The red hot labor market is cooling off a little, but it remains resilient. It’s the type of thing you’d want to see if the “soft landing” scenario we’re aiming for, where the economy slows down without going into negative territory, is going to happen. Inflation has moderated. Consumers are still hanging in there. The country’s GDP growth for the third quarter is expected to come in quite strong. It actually needs to slow a little bit if inflation is going to come down more. Objectively, you can’t look around and declare, “Yes, we are in the midst of a broad-based recession.”

Still, after the last few years, being nervous is well within many Americans’ rights. Plenty of people have been nervous about the economy for what feels like forever, to the point that it might just be time to accept that at least some level of economic anxiety is a permanent state of being. It’s understandable. The possibility of a recession is scary, inflation is a real bummer, and the thing most people do to exist in the economy — work — is not always super fun. For millions of low-income Americans, economic precarity feels like a fact of life.

There are potential headwinds ahead, as there always are — that’s sort of the name of the game. And there are indicators pointing in negative directions, too. A lot of the excess savings people built up in the pandemic have dissipated, and the programs the government put in place to shore up people’s finances and the economy have by and large dried up. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for well over a year in an attempt to slow the economy down and combat inflation, and it’s not clear whether the full effects of that have been felt. (Remember the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse from the spring? That was in part the result of Fed rate hikes.)

“It’s a hold-your-breath moment, because you’re just waiting,” said Claudia Sahm, the founder of Sahm Consulting and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. “That’s always the case, but now I think it’s even more reinforced. We’ve been in uncharted territory since 2020, and now it’s seeing if we can get out of it. You can make the case in every direction.”

On the economy, the vibes and realities don’t always match — there’s often a negative bias here, too. People’s individual circumstances vary as well. If you’re a striking auto worker, if your student loan payments are about to come back, or if you got swept up in some of the tech layoffs earlier this year, you’re of course going to be extra worried right now.

“We’ve been in uncharted territory since 2020”

At the macro level, really, things do seem pretty solid. But there are some potential uncertainties to keep in mind.

Strikes, student debt, and the shutdown are an economic “triple threat,” in the bad way

In the short term, there are multiple factors that, while small on their own, could add up to a significant drag on the economy when combined. The United Auto Workers strikes, the pending resumption of student debt payments, and the risk of a government shutdown represent a “triple threat on the economy” at the moment, Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told me in a recent interview. “It’s the combination of the headwinds that can hurt you more than any single isolated incident.”

The UAW strikes cost the economy $1.6 billion in their first week, according to an estimate by Michigan consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, with the impact largely being felt in the places where the union’s strikes are taking place. The longer the strikes go on — and the more the UAW escalates to have more workers walk off the job — the worse the scenario will get. Initially, the UAW struck at just three plants in three states, now it’s escalated to 38 plants across 20 states. That’s expanded its geographic reach as well as its disruption.

It’s a similar situation with a potential government shutdown, which could be just days away if Congress doesn’t strike a deal by midnight on September 30. Some of the economic activity lost during shutdowns will be recovered — government workers who have to forgo their paychecks during that time eventually do get paid. Still, there is damage: the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 34 days, led to $3 billion in permanent lost economic growth, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Regardless, a shutdown isn’t an awesome sign for the state of anything. “The government shutdown is about politics and dysfunction,” Sahm said. “It can’t be good for the economy.”

Student loan repayments, put on pause during the pandemic, are set to become due again in October — for real this time. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that will cost American households some $70 billion each year. That is likely to hit consumer spending somewhat — borrowers will be sending $200 or $300 to the government each month instead of injecting it into the economy. It’s not going to do the economy in.

“Sure, it’s going to have an effect, but I think the magnitudes are not big enough to drive us into a recession unless we’re already on the verge of a recession,” said Constantine Yannelis, an associate professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The White House has laid out an “on-ramp” for student loan repayments to get people back to paying over time that may also soften the economic blow.

There are other short-term negative factors in play as well. Oil prices have risen and, in turn, so has the cost of gas. Mortgage rates are spiking. Most, if not all, pandemic relief programs have sunsetted, including food stamps, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance. Congress allowed the expanded child tax credit to expire as well.

“The pandemic relief programs clearly had effects on demand, clearly had effects on improving balance sheets and debt,” Sahm said. “It’s not hard to think about which direction [the end of the programs] goes.”

Child poverty spiked in 2022 after supplemental programs were ended. Millions of people have lost Medicaid.

The labor market is still good! But it’s slowing down, and the Fed’s still doing its thing.

If everything we were talking about up to this point was sort of small-scale, short-term risk, this is the part where we get to the medium stuff. Keeping with the spirit of the rule of threes, let’s put it into three categories that are top of mind: jobs, inflation, and the Fed.

The overarching headline about the US labor market during the pandemic recovery has been that it’s astonishingly resilient. Many workers were able to get hired, to trade out of bad jobs for better ones, and to join the labor force. Inflation did outpace wage growth for a while, but that’s no longer the case, and those at the bottom end of the income spectrum in particular have really been able to make important gains. In recent months, things have started to moderate. People are quitting their jobs at more normal rates, and job openings have fallen. Job gains have slowed as well. As of the August jobs report, the US was adding an average of 150,000 jobs per month over the past three months. By comparison, at the start of the year, the figure was more than double that.

“The very pillar that is reason for optimism is becoming less solid as we move through the year”

This is all headed in the direction of “normal” territory. The question is whether normal sticks. The downward trend could continue into negative territory, meaning the labor market adds fewer and fewer jobs until we eventually see job losses. “What stops that deceleration?” Sahm said.

“We’re seeing an ongoing slowdown in the labor market,” Daco said. “The very pillar that is reason for optimism is becoming less solid as we move through the year.”

It’s also worth noting that a normal jobs market doesn’t mean an optimal one. The Black unemployment rate has typically remained much higher than the white unemployment rate, though this recent tight labor market has led to historically low unemployment rates for Black workers. If anything, the past few years have shown that we don’t have a great sense of just how good the labor market can get.

Inflation increasing again is another concern. It’s moving in the right direction generally, but the ride is likely to be bumpy. While the hope for the labor market is that it stays close to where it is, the hope for inflation, which is in the 3-4 percent range annually, continues to come down, heading more toward that 2 percent rate the Fed aims for in the long term. What’s more, some of the factors that could contribute to increasing inflation — trade disruptions, rising oil prices — are very much out of the Fed’s hands.

“We’re seeing a lot of political instability in China at the moment and an increasing decoupling between China and the US, and more generally, we’ve entered, since the pandemic, a new era of trade protectionism,” Yannelis said.

“While the Fed will say they care about all inflation, they can do nothing about [oil and gas price] inflation,” Sahm said. “That’s global demand, that’s global politics.”

Speaking of the Fed, that’s where another wild card comes in — or, at least, wild-ish. In September, it left interest rates unchanged in a sign that it’s relatively optimistic about where the economy is headed. It’s expected to raise interest rates once more this year and has also indicated it will keep rates higher for longer in 2024. It’s a sign the Fed seems to believe the economy can withstand higher rates for longer. That means borrowing costs will likely stay high, something many consumers, businesses, and investors may not love. Still, the economy is unpredictable, and economic forecasts are just that — forecasts.

It’s still not clear if we’ve seen the full fallout of the actions the Fed’s already taken. “I’m still in the camp that we haven’t seen the effect of all the Fed’s interest rates, and frankly, I’m most concerned with the risks in the financial sector,” Sahm said, pointing to the role higher interest rates played in Silicon Valley Bank’s implosion. That being said, the Fed hiking interest rates so much thus far could have pushed the country into a recession, and it didn’t. “With a recession, typically there’s been a shock. The Fed rapidly raising interest rates by over 5 percentage points, that could have been a shock, but it’s not like we rolled right into a recession,” she said.

Qian Wang, an economist at Vanguard Group, said she sees a potential problem where the Fed gets stuck between a rock and a hard place as different parts of the economy move in different directions. “I think the biggest risk is that the Fed may get into a dilemma and inflation may pick up actually again and economic growth may weaken and slow down, so that literally makes a soft landing impossible,” she said.

To be sure, there are all sorts of scenarios that could play out. Yannelis pointed to “tail-risk nightmare scenarios” in the long term (or, really, whenever) that could obviously do big damage to the economy — artificial intelligence getting out of control, a disastrous 2024 election where people en masse refuse to accept the results, large-scale confrontation between global powers, like Russia and NATO. It’s important to point out here that these are really unlikely scenarios. Also, if there is a global nuclear war, it’s not really going to matter what mortgage rate your local bank is offering.

Maybe it’s just time to embrace economic anxiety acceptance

Now that I’ve spent a lot of this story bumming you out a little, I want to emphasize here that there really are plenty of reasons for optimism about the economy — on jobs, consumer spending, and growth. The soft landing scenario seems very much possible, though most economists and policymakers aren’t rushing to call this a definitive win.

“We do feel that a soft landing is not impossible, of course, but we don’t think that’s our baseline scenario,” Wang said, noting Vanguard’s base case is a recession within the next 18 months. “The market sentiment is getting too high.”

“We have not soft landed, we are still in the landing process”

“Objectively, the economy’s feeling pretty good, but it’s vulnerable, because it’s still dealing with high interest rates. And you throw in these headwinds, and I don’t think we’re home free yet,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “You can’t declare mission accomplished yet. We have not soft landed, we are still in the landing process.”

The US economy has been claimed to be near a recession for months and months now, and one doesn’t appear to have happened yet. There will very likely be a downturn again at some moment, because recessions, historically, have been a fact of economic life. It’s fair to say that right now, the economy looks quite strong and resilient, and there are also risks. Whether those risks will add up to something impactful isn’t something anyone can definitively declare."
Jan 09 2024,Donald Trump says he hopes economy tanks this election year 'because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover',"""USA Today"" Contributor",left,https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/09/donald-trump-hopes-economy-crashes-in-2024/72159263007,"WASHINGTON − Former President Donald Trump seems to be rooting for a financial crash this year so that it can help him get reelected.

“When there’s a crash − I hope it’s gonna be during this next 12 months, because I don't want to be Herbert Hoover,"" Trump told interviewer Lou Dobbs on the ""Lindell TV"" platform.

Hoover was president during the stock market crash of 1929 and the onset of the Great Depression.

The White House and President Joe Biden's reelection campaign said Trump and the Republicans are willing to hurt the middle class for their own political benefit.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates, noting that consumer confidence is rising, inflation is falling, and employment is up, said ""a commander-in-chief’s duty is to always put the American people first; never to hope that hard-working families suffer economic pain for their own political benefit.""

Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden's campaign manager, said that “Donald Trump should just say he doesn’t give a damn about people, because that’s exactly what he’s telling the American people.""

Trump, who described the economy as ""fragile,"" has been predicting calamity under Biden for years. But most economic indicators at the present time are favorable as the economy recovers from COVID-era shutdowns.

Democrats and commentators said Trump is rooting for failure that would hurt millions of Americans in order to attack Biden.

""It's just another manifestation of the insensitivity and the grotesqueness of this person,"" said House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., speaking on MSNBC."

Nov 28 2023,The obvious and not-so-obvious reasons people are unhappy about the economy,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/four-reasons-people-unhappy-economy,"Economic sentiment and President Joe Biden’s approval ratings are low despite strong output and employment growth for reasons both obvious and subtle.

The public is gloomy about the state of the economy even though two of the most important measures of economic health are strong — namely, GDP growth has been strong in recent quarters, and the employment rate is high by historical standards.

TALKING TURKEY: ARE BLACK FRIDAY DEALS A SCAM OR A STEAL?

For example, the University of Michigan’s Index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 61.3 this month. That’s better than it was last year during the worst of the inflationary bout, but still low by historical standards. It’s well lower than it was, for example, when unemployment was as low as it is now, 3.9%, in December 2018.

University of Michigan Surveys of Consumer Sentiment University of Michigan Surveys of Consumer Sentiment

Similarly, Biden is deeply underwater in terms of approval ratings on the economy, with disapproval near 60% in the RealClearPolitics average of polls .

Here’s why the public is unhappy:

THE OBVIOUS REASON: PRICES ARE HIGH

Prices were 18% higher in October than they were in October 2020, according to the Consumer Price Index.

In recent months, inflation has fallen from as high as 8.9% year-over-year in June 2022 to 3.2% in October. The White House has touted the decline in the inflation rate, and overall economic sentiment has improved as it has come down. Over the past year, average hourly earnings have outpaced inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Still, a decline in the rate of inflation means that prices are still rising — just more slowly. Many households are still facing hardship because prices shot up so fast in recent years.

That’s especially true for the prices of goods that people buy frequently, and thus likely feed into their perception of overall price pressures.

Most notably, grocery prices are up more than 20% over the past three years, according to the CPI. Recent research suggests that grocery prices play an outside role in shaping perceptions of inflation.

Gas prices, which commuters see at the pump several times a month, are up 66%.

Erik Lundh, a principal economist at The Conference Board, which puts out a closely watched index of consumer confidence, said that people are focused on prices and costs and that groceries and gas are top-of-mind.

“It takes a while to get used to new price levels,” he said.

A NOT-SO-OBVIOUS REASON: INTEREST RATES

One major non-obvious factor depressing economic sentiment is that higher interest rates are putting some purchases out of reach for households.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 7.44%, according to the latest data from Freddie Mac, up from 3.22% at the start of 2022. The average mortgage payment on a new home has nearly doubled from 2020, creating an affordability crisis .

Similarly, rates for auto loans and credit cards have shot up in recent months as the Federal Reserve has raised its interest rate target in a bid to arrest inflation.

In other words, while prices for big-ticket items may not be rising as fast as they were in previous months, they’re still becoming less affordable because finance costs are going up.

The effects of higher interest rates have been clearly reflected in indices of sentiment.

In the Conference Board Consumer Confidence index, the number of respondents saying they planned to buy a home in the next year plunged by roughly 50% from October 2022 to October 2023, Lundh noted, a sign of interest rate costs weighing on households (although that metric does not feed directly into the overall index).

A NOT-SO-OBVIOUS REASON: REPUBLICAN ANGST

Republicans seem to be disproportionately unhappy about the economy, dragging down overall measures of sentiment.

The University of Michigan survey breaks out sentiment by partisanship. While sentiment improved among Democrats first as the country emerged from the pandemic shutdowns and then again as inflation has abated, independents still aren’t feeling as good as they were pre-pandemic — and from Republicans’ point of view, the country is still in a terrible recession.

It’s not unusual for people to be less happy about the state of the country when their party is out of power. But Republican sentiment appears to be more sensitive to partisan control of the White House. An analysis by former Biden White House economists found that overall sentiment is lower than what might be expected based on economic fundamentals and that disproportionate GOP unhappiness explained about a third of the difference.

A NOT-SO-OBVIOUS REASON: THE PANDEMIC CHANGED EVERYTHING

The pandemic uprooted life for almost everyone and led to far-reaching changes in commerce and day-to-day life. The changes are so wide-ranging that it is possible that, for example, a 3.9% unemployment rate today is not the same as it was four years ago before the pandemic. The circumstances around today’s low unemployment might be overall less favorable than back then, whether it’s because of the loss of a small business, changing expectations about working from home or in an office, or a thousand other differences.

“I do still believe it is a reasonable hypothesis that consumer sentiment underwent a structural change during the pandemic,” said Yongchen Zhao, an economist at Towson University. “And it is not unfair to believe that an entire generation of consumers may have become permanently less optimistic after the pandemic.”

Zhao, who has published research on the determinants of consumers, noted the changes in the economy that could have played a role in the shift. For instance, restaurants and retail have continued to find their footing in the post-pandemic era while the tech sector has prospered."

Oct 23 2023,Housing disaster threatens economy in front of Biden's eyes,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/housing-disaster-threatens-economy-bidens-eyes,"Housing industry officials are warning the Biden administration that the market is headed for disaster without help and, so far, have received only a muted response.

In recent months, homebuying has become so expensive that it is out of reach for most people. The industry, which usually accounts for about a sixth of economic output, has taken a massive hit. And families are having to put off major life decisions because the market lacks homes within financial reach.

INTEREST RATES FOR RETAIL CREDIT CARDS HIT RECORD AS FED WORKS TO CONTAIN INFLATION

The housing chaos, along with broader inflation, is a major drag on President Joe Biden’s economic approval ratings, which are poor, even though the labor market is strong and GDP growth has proved resilient. Yet the administration has taken only the merest of steps to address the problem by policy or messaging — a stark contrast to its efforts, for example, to counteract criticisms about its handling of inflation or even its measures to aid student loan borrowers.

Housing markets have been driven to near-crisis because mortgage rates have soared from nearly 3% at the start of last year to around 8% in recent weeks.

In theory, higher mortgage rates could be offset by lower home prices — because fewer people would be able to finance a home at each price point, demand should fall, and prices should go down accordingly.

And indeed, prices did fall after mortgage rates began rising in 2022 — a bit. But not much, and then they began rising again in 2023.

The problem is that while demand for homes did decrease, supply did as well. Sales of existing homes have cratered. That’s because many homeowners who’d taken out mortgages with interest rates closer to 3% or 4% have realized that if they sell, they’d need to take out new mortgages to buy a new home — and those mortgages would be far costlier. In other words, interest rates shot up so fast that it locked many people in their homes, putting their life plans on hold and freezing the market.

The net result is the worst of both worlds: Higher mortgage rates and high prices, meaning that mortgage payments are extremely high. Affordability in August was the worst in records going back to 1989, according to the National Association of Realtors, or NAR, and it has only gotten worse since.

The typical homebuyer’s monthly mortgage payment was $2,866 in August, according to the real estate company Redfin, roughly double what it was as recently as mid-2020. A homebuyer must earn about $115,000 a year to afford the typical U.S. home, which sold for roughly $420,000, yet the typical household only earns $75,000, according to the Census Bureau.

For months, the broader housing and construction industry has been kept afloat by a supply of newly built homes — the lack of supply of existing homes has pushed buyers toward new construction. The rental market, too, has performed well, with huge amounts of new multifamily supply keeping rents low and construction employment surprisingly high.

But as mortgage rates have breached the 8% mark, even construction is threatened. Higher interest rates, generally, have also made it harder for builders to finance new projects.

Housing starts have drifted lower over the course of the year, and homebuilder sentiment also dropped off in recent months, according to the National Association of Home Builders, or NAHB, suggesting that the market is cooling.

INDUSTRY GROUPS ASK FOR HELP

The darkening outlook has led industry groups to ask the federal government for relief.

Earlier this month, NAR, the NAHB, and the Mortgage Bankers Association petitioned Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to swear off interest rate hikes.

In an effort to address the historic inflation wracking the country, the Fed raised its interest rate target from near zero at the start of 2022 to now as high as 5.5%. Changes in that short-term rate affect rates on all other credit instruments, including mortgages.

In fact, mortgage rates have soared even beyond what would be expected based on other interest rates, the industry groups noted.

“They have gone sort of out of whack,” said Scott Olson, the executive director of Community Home Lenders of America.

Although it’s not well understood why mortgage rates have soared beyond what might be expected, housing sector representatives are looking for two responses from the government.

The first is for the Fed to stop selling off its massive holdings of mortgage-backed securities. The central bank has removed about $200 billion of mortgage bonds over the past year, leading to greater supply in the market and driving up rates on mortgages.

The second is for the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be allowed to purchase mortgage-backed securities for their own portfolios. Fannie and Freddie support the secondary market for mortgages by buying them from originators such as banks and bundling them into securities to sell to investors. They also hold mortgages in their own portfolios — once, as much as $800 billion apiece. Under the terms of the 2008 government bailout, though, those portfolios are being wound down, and they now each have less than $100 billion.

NAR, the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the Community Home Lenders of America asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier this month to amend the terms of the Treasury’s agreements with Fannie and Freddie to allow them temporarily to hold more MBSs to relieve pressure on the market.

“That’s one thing that directly the Biden administration could do,” Olson said.

THE ADMINISTRATION RESPONSE

So far, the Biden administration’s response has been limited.

The soaring interest rates, in part, are out of its control. Control of monetary policy is the Fed’s role, and the Biden administration has said it will not weigh in on interest rate decisions out of respect for the Fed’s independence. (That’s a change in course from the previous administration. President Donald Trump pressured the central bank to cut rates when he thought money got too tight.)

The Treasury could allow the GSEs to rebuild their MBS portfolios, as requested by the industry groups. The agency did not respond to a request for comment from the Washington Examiner about that possibility.

Otherwise, the White House has not done or said much regarding the problem in recent weeks.

Last week, with little publicity, it put out a fact sheet listing a few new efforts to boost homeownership, including a Federal Housing Administration policy allowing prospective borrowers to use income from renting out accessory dwelling units to count as income for the purposes of qualifying for an FHA mortgage. The White House also touted the nearly $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund authorized by the 2021 Democratic pandemic relief bill, which it said has assisted 400,000 homeowners at risk of foreclosure.

Still, the lack of urgency is notable, especially considering the signs that unaffordable housing and high interest rates are taking a toll on Biden’s approval ratings. Higher interest rates have fed into negative perceptions of the economy in recent months, according to the Conference Board’s index of consumer confidence.

In contrast, the Biden administration went to great lengths to convince the public that it was responding to the problem when the problem was soaring oil and gas prices. As with interest rates, there is little the White House can do in the short term to bring down the price of oil. Yet when oil soared to near $115, Biden ordered huge releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, called on Congress to suspend the gas tax, directed the Federal Trade Commission to investigate oil companies for gouging, and asked drillers to increase supply. He gave public speeches meant to reassure voters that he was trying to bring down gas prices.

So far, though, the housing troubles have not elicited a similar response.

SUPPLY

Over time, building more housing would lower prices, if not necessarily mortgages, bringing housing costs down.

“What we’re seeing now is an increase in prices that is directly tied to a lack of supply,” said David Dworkin, president and CEO of the National Housing Conference. “The only way you can address that is with more supply. We’ve got to build more housing.”

Dworkin noted two bipartisan bills his group backs to boost supply. One is the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act, which would expand and strengthen the low-income housing tax credit, which rewards developers who build or restore housing targeted at lower-income households.

The other is the Neighborhood Homes Investment Act, which would create a new tax credit to increase the incentive for developers to build new homes in areas where prices are so low that there is little benefit to investing in new construction.

Recent White Houses, including Biden’s, have identified local land-use regulations and zoning laws as a major barrier to supply, meaning that the problem, in some ways, is not the federal government’s. Still, Biden’s economic team has launched several initiatives to coax lower-level governments to ease off such rules, by rewarding them with funds through the Department of Housing and Urban Development, by giving priority in Department of Transportation funding to cities and towns to reform their zoning, and by changing rules in existing housing programs."

Nov 20 2023,"Snow removal, homelessness and economy among topics at State of the City Address",Alaska's News Source KTUU/KYES,center,https://alaskasnewssource.com/2023/11/21/snow-removal-homelessness-economy-among-topics-state-city-address,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Mayor Dave Bronson gave his annual State of the City speech Monday in downtown Anchorage, addressing a variety of accomplishments and challenges including snow removal efforts, homelessness and the economy.

November’s record-breaking snowfall tested the limits and preparedness of the city’s snow removal crews, Bronson said.

“I know that many of you have been frustrated as the snow has impacted your daily lives, your businesses, our schools and the safety of our roads,” Bronson said. “I hear you loud and clear. I agree with you. Trust me, I really do hear you.”

Bronson had been criticized for moving snow removal assets from residential areas to help with state-maintained roadways. After his speech, the mayor defended this.

“We have to keep the public roads, the high-speed roads, open, “Bronson said. “So people can get food. So the ambulances can get in. Now the ambulances were coming into the neighborhoods and having challenges. I understand that, but why would I plow a neighborhood when you could get out of your neighborhood and out of your driveway and then you get to a major road that’s impassable?”

There are more snow removal resources, and staff, this year compared to last, Bronson said.

“Last year it took us nearly 50 days to get emergency procurement contracts in place so we can get more resources,” Bronson said. “That usually means graters to help with the snow hauling and the snow plowing.”

The mayor’s administration will be having roundtable discussions about this winter’s snow response, so far, and said he’ll be sharing those findings.

Anchorage Assembly Chair Chris Constant said he agreed with a lot of the mayor’s speech and disagreed with other parts.

“When you hear issues relating to limited snow hauling and all the issues we had last week, we had multiple vacancies,” Constant said. “We have 49 vacancies in maintenance and operations, and so it’s no wonder the services can’t be delivered in a timely manner. You know, the mayor’s message in October was, ‘If we get a snow like we had in December, we are ready.’ Well, we had less snow so far in November than we did last December. And so, we weren’t ready. Why? Because we don’t have workers in the jobs.”

The mayor also talked about the homelessness crisis in Anchorage.

“Our initiative to transform the solid waste service admin building to a cold weather shelter have protected numerous Anchorage residents from our unforgiving Alaskan winters and we appreciate the Anchorage Assembly for supporting our recommendation to expand the number of available beds.”

Both the mayor and Constant said they have both been working together on a variety of issues.

“The one area that I think we have the closest alignment with the administration, I think his words were pretty accurate, are issues relating to housing policy,” Constant said. “The Assembly has been very aggressive at working on jumpstarting the housing economy to make sure everybody has a place to live in this town.”

The mayor also talked about 2023 being a record-breaking year for local tourism, calling the topic “the shining star.”

“The heart of our city, downtown Anchorage, is finally emerging from the challenges we face during the pandemic undergoing a renaissance with the establishment of the mushing district and significant business developments that bring energy and vitality to our urban core,” Bronson said. “People are coming back to downtown.”

Alaska’s News Source asked the mayor about safety issues we’ve been hearing about from downtown businesses. Kaladi Brothers Coffee, said in a Facebook post, they’d be closing their downtown location on Dec. 1.

“It’s a big hindrance,” Bronson said. “But we’re still having — we had a very robust year, a very good year. Best tourist year yet.”

Alaska’s News Source also asked Constant about the safety issues downtown.

“There’s no question that, yes we had a record year of tourism, more visitors than ever and we had great revenue that comes from it,” Constant said. “And there’s also no question that there are issues in the community, in the downtown streets, that people aren’t feeling safe. And how we manage that is through a public safety response at this point. We have our outreach. We have our other services relating to people who are unhoused. But we also have issues of crime that are going unmanaged in the downtown.”

In his speech, Bronson also talked about economic development.

“Landmark projects like NorthLink Aviation’s new cargo terminal breaking ground at Ted Stevens International Airport, just several weeks ago and global power players like Amazon building new facilities within the municipality,” Bronson said.

Bronson also talked about his increase in funding to snow removal in the city, in his proposed budget, and increasing pay for the Anchorage Police Department, giving them “the largest pay increase in the history of the municipality.”

The mayor also talked about securing funding to modernize and repair the Port of Alaska.

Anchorage Assembly Vice Chair Meg Zaletel also talked about the mayor’s speech afterward.

“We have some areas of agreement,” Zaletel said. “But what it really doesn’t drill down into is that what’s been keeping the city moving for the past year is the work of the Anchorage Assembly. A lot of the accomplishments that the mayor is taking credit for often are because the Assembly is overriding vetoes or bringing forward legislation. It is not coming from his administration.”

Alaska’s News Source asked the mayor about this criticism.

“We partner on a lot of things,” Bronson said. “But we provide the path forward and they support us. They’re saying things that they do that we support them on too. The Title 21 reforms that, you know, Kevin Cross is working on. That’s really good. I met with Kevin this morning. The contest isn’t as deep as people think.”

Nov 03 2023,How Daylight Saving Time clock changes upend the economy,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/how-daylight-saving-time-upends-economy,"On Sunday, Nov. 5, most of the U.S. will dial back their clocks an hour in order to ""fall back"" to standard time as part of the nation's semi-annual ritual of changing the time.

While much of the analysis surrounding America's twice-a-year clock changes covers the health effects of Daylight Saving Time (DST) – which includes a higher risk of cardiac issues amid disrupted sleep schedules – the economic toll has not received as much focus.

However, research indicates that changing the clock twice a year has adverse impacts on the money side of things that are very real, and the evidence is growing.

A study published last year by researchers from several business schools found that investors and capital market participants are slower to respond to accounting reports in the week after we ""spring forward"" – which falls smack in the middle of earnings season.

""These results are strongest among firms with investors who are more likely to be trading on earnings news and among firms with a less sophisticated investor base,"" the authors wrote. ""Further analysis reveals that our main results are driven by muted reactions to positive earnings surprises, consistent with cognitive impairment and investor pessimism jointly underlying the diminished market response to earnings news.""

FOUR-DAY WORKWEEK GAINING STEAM, RESTAURANT, MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES SAY IT DOESN'T WORK

Another set of business school researchers found that on the Monday following DST, there is a rise in workplace injuries. Not only that, the injuries were more severe (measured by days of work lost due to the injuries), which surged by 67%.

A subsequent study discovered that on the Monday after DST there is a sharp uptick in ""cyberloafing,"" the practice of employees scrolling the internet for non-work-related activities.

There is also evidence the time change leads to an increase in heart attacks, strokes and depression, leading to an increase in health care costs. Even commuting becomes more treacherous and expensive, given that the change to DST has been linked to spikes in car accidents.

YOU CAN'T FIRE THEM, THEY QUIT

Additionally, while DST has been touted as an energy-saving move, a 2008 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that DST actually led to a 1% increase in residential energy consumption by consumers in Indiana – costing households in the state an extra $9 million on their electric bills and resulting in another estimated $1.7 to $5.5 million in ""social costs of increased pollution emissions.""

The actual dollar amount of the collective impact of these factors is tough to pin down, but a Chmura Economics & Analytics study from a decade ago found that the springtime change cost the U.S. economy more than $433 million. As of 2021, Manhattan Institute senior fellow Allison Schrager reported that DST cost the airline industry alone hundreds of millions of dollars.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PROPOSE MAJOR ENERGY AND PERMITTING REFORM PACKAGE

Despite evidence indicating changing the clocks has negative impacts on Americans' health and the economy, the latest effort in Congress to end the practice appears stalled.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been leading a bipartisan coalition for years to make what is currently DST, the new standard time. His ""Sunshine Protection Act"" eliminating the time change passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent last year, but the House never took it up that Congress.

Rubio reintroduced his legislation in March, backed by several senators from both sides of the political aisle, and Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., filed a companion bill in the House. Both bills remain in committees."
Dec 08 2023,"US economy adds 199,000 jobs in November, unemployment rate unexpectedly falls",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-november-2023,"U.S. job growth continued to chug along at a healthy pace in November, suggesting that the labor market remains resilient even in the face of higher interest rates, stubborn inflation and other economic uncertainties.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, as striking autoworkers and actors returned to work. That was slightly above the 180,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.7% after rising for three straight months, driven by a sizable drop in the jobless rate for teenagers.

The report also contained modest downward revisions to job growth at the beginning of fall. Gains for September were revised down by a total of 35,000 jobs to 262,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is weaker than it previously appeared. October's gain was unchanged at 150,000 jobs.

WORKERS NOW DEMANDING NEARLY $80K TO START NEW JOB

""Today’s jobs report shows a continued stabilization following the hot summer hiring season, leading to a New Year reset,"" said Becky Frankiewicz, chief commercial officer of ManpowerGroup. ""We’ve anticipated a stabilization, and we’re moving toward it slowly but surely.""

In another show of strength for the economy, average hourly earnings – a key measure of inflation – increased 0.4% for the month and remained up 4% from the same time one year ago. The monthly increase came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% estimate, but the annual figure was in line with expectations.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally cooling after more than a year of interest rate hikes. Policymakers voted last month to leave their benchmark rate unchanged for a second straight time to assess the cumulative impact of previous increases.

FED LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED DESPITE STILL-HIGH INFLATION

Many economists believe that the Fed is done with its tightening campaign, although Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that it would be ""premature"" to assume that there will be no more rate hikes – and to speculate on when policy may ease.

Stocks fell after the stronger-than-expected jobs report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.4%.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 38790.43 +75.66 +0.20% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 16103.44802 +130.27 +0.82% SP500 S&P 500 5149.42 +32.33 +0.63%

The Fed will hold its final two-day meeting of the year next week, and investors are closely watching for clues about what comes next for monetary policy amid signs that inflation is continuing to cool. Pricing suggests that the central bank will cut interest rates as soon as March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

""To the extent that the market was expecting four (or more) rate cuts next year, reports like this one are bound to cast shade on that belief and could lead to disappointment in the short run,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.

Job gains were mostly concentrated in a handful of sectors last month, with the biggest gains in health care (76,800), government (49,000) and leisure and hospitality (40,000). Hiring in manufacturing also trended upward, reflecting the return of UAW workers who had been on strike against General Motors, Stellantis and Ford.

Employment declined in retail trade, reflecting declines in department stores as well as furniture, home furnishings and electronics retailers.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown. But there are some signs that cracks are beginning to appear after last year's blistering pace of growth.

""Sorting through the noise, the picture that is emerging is one of a resilient but cooler labor market,"" said Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist. ""Job gains have become less broad-based, labor demand continues to fall, and jobless claims are creeping higher in a sign of softer conditions."""
Nov 01 2023,"Inflation, economy on the minds of Virginia voters ahead of upcoming election",WTOP,center,https://wtop.com/virginia/2023/11/inflation-economy-on-the-minds-of-virginia-voters-ahead-of-upcoming-election,"In less than a week, Virginia voters head to the polls for a closely-watched, high-stakes election, and the economy is on the minds of many people who will cast a ballot, according to a recent poll.

In less than a week, Virginia voters head to the polls for a closely-watched, high-stakes election, and the economy is on the minds of many people who will cast a ballot, according to a recent poll from The Wason Center at Christopher Newport University.

The poll of 800 likely voters from Virginia showed that “the economy and inflation” was the number one answer for which issue is top-of-mind.

“Pocketbook issues are just something that a lot of voters are thinking about,” said Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo, the poll’s research director. “When you’re thinking about how much money you’re spending on groceries or on gas, it’s a common issue that people deal with in their lives.”

Inflation is not a Virginia-specific issue, but it has the attention of many voters choosing candidates who will represent them locally.

“Most voters are lumping the economy and inflation together,” Bromley-Trujillo said. “When voters mentioned the economy in other years, they’re not necessarily thinking about inflation; they may be thinking about much broader issues.”

The answers varied depending on political party, with 41% of Republicans saying the economy and inflation was their number one issue.

For Democrats, just 12% gave that answer, with many saying they care more about abortion and gun laws.

“A lot of these races are nationalized, so they’re prioritizing issues that may or may not be directly influenced by our state legislature,” Bromley-Trujillo said.

The poll has a margin of error of plus-or-minus four percentage points.

All 140 General Assembly seats are on the ballot.

With the legislature narrowly divided, both parties believe they have a path to a full statehouse majority, running through a little more than a dozen battleground districts centered in central Virginia, Hampton Roads and the outer D.C. suburbs.

If the GOP holds onto both chambers of the state legislature, then it would clear the way for Gov. Glenn Youngkin to move swiftly on what he calls his “commonsense” conservative priorities — boosting pay and funding for law enforcement, protecting parental rights in education, overhauling the mental health system, enacting additional tax cuts and greater restrictions on abortion.

While he has notched some successes on taxes and education through bipartisan support during his first two legislative sessions, a lot of his priorities have been blocked by the Democratic majority in the Senate.

Democrats claimed that total Republican control would lead to the repeal of legislation enacted in 2020 and 2021 while they ran the state government, such as measures that mandated a transition to cleaner cars and an electric generation, greatly expanded voting access and added restrictions to firearms purchases and ownership.

A lot of Democratic candidates are making abortion a top campaign issue, saying that Youngkin’s proposed ban on abortion after 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother, would harm women’s health and interfere with their bodily autonomy.

Virginia is the only state in the South that has not enacted new restrictions since the Supreme Court overturned its landmark Roe v. Wade ruling last year and stripped protections for abortion.

LAHAINA, Hawaii – It's a perfect early morning at Kaanapali Beach in West Maui and a dawn voyage on an Ultimate Whale Watch tour is nearly full, with visitors eager to spot humpback whales.

""Alright everybody, good morning! I'm Captain Kristina and we also have Captain Sarah today. Welcome aboard,"" says Kristina Rau. She jokes that they'll have double the fun with two captains.

It's peak whale watching season, what Rau calls ""whale soup"" because they're popping up all over the place. As the co-captains review safety protocols, Sarah Hakan includes some new talking points that she's added since the wildfires last August.

""We experienced some great loss personally, so we want to keep the topic on whales today,"" she says. ""We are very grateful to be able to be out here with you guys and have some normalcy back in our lives."" She quickly pivots and asks the crowd, ""are you excited? Are you ready? I think there is a whale there!""

It was six months ago that deadly wildfires swept through Lahaina, killing 100 people and destroying the historic town, as well as homes in central Maui. In the immediate aftermath of the fires, officials discouraged all non-essential travel to West Maui, where Lahaina is located. And visitor arrivals for the whole island dropped precipitously – in August they were down almost 58% from August the previous year.

The recovery is slowly moving ahead, but tourism – the backbone of the economy for Lahaina as well as Maui – is still struggling to reboot in trying circumstances. West Maui opened to tourists in October and though hazardous debris removal has been underway since, cleanup of the ash just got started three weeks ago.

Lee James, owner of Ultimate Whale Watch in Lahaina, says he's happy to put captains Rau and Hakan and others back to work after being out of business for about four months. He needed time to repair his fleet: four of his five boats were damaged or destroyed in the fires, and he got his first boat back out on the water in December.

""When people come back to work, part of that weight is lifted, and then you get on the water, and it's just energizing, and then you can laugh again,"" says James. ""It's good to see that.""

Still, he's only operating two boats now and doing less than half the business he typically did before the fires. He's also employing far fewer people – down from 35 workers to between 16 - 20 depending on bookings.

James says he's trying to take things a day at a time.

""Six months ago you're like, 'are we going to be able to stay on the island?'"" he says. And still today, he checks in with his wife every so often, asking her if this is still where she wants to be. ""It's such a fluid and dynamic situation,"" he says. Things feel hard but the couple is committed to staying on Maui.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR

James' company is one of the more than 800 businesses that operated in the disaster area, providing work for about 7,000 people. Local advisors to Maui's mayor estimate about a third of that commerce is back in West Maui at the six-month mark, though the challenges are still profound.

""The stress right now in the community is we just can't go back to the way things were,"" says Sne Patel, president of the LahainaTown Action Committee. He also serves on Maui's Recovery Commission.

""People not only lost their businesses that day, but also many of them lost their homes,"" he says. ""Their employees lost their homes as well.""

Patel says commercial rents are going up because of the shortage of space, and some business owners can't afford to stay in West Maui. Many are relocating elsewhere on the island. With the trauma of the wildfires so fresh, and a lack of long-term housing in Lahaina, the workforce is unstable, he says.

""They're perhaps not even ready to go back [to work], considering they could have lost family,"" says Patel. Many people, he says, are struggling with their mental health. ""There's so many issues that arise from an event like this,"" he says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR

Childcare and schools were disrupted, as multi-generational households have been spread out all over the island, leading to long commutes hampered by the added traffic of trucks removing debris from the burn zone.

Patel is worried about the future. In addition to his other roles, he's also the sales director at a resort rental company and anticipates a 30-40% drop in visitors to the Lahaina area as long as the region is rebuilding, which local officials say could take five years. Patel based his estimate on hotel and rental bookings through this summer.

""It's really that economic tsunami that's yet to really come.""

Because of the density of resorts and vacation rentals on this part of the island, he says as goes Lahaina, so goes Maui. For 2023, the number of visitors to the whole island was down 15% from the previous year, according to Hawaii's Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism.

""You can't divorce the economic impact of the disaster in Lahaina and the impact on the whole island,"" says Patel.

The Maui Economic Development Board says about 70% of every dollar generated on Maui comes from tourism.

Patel says Maui is not in a position to walk away from the tourism-based economy, but more could be done to strike a balance for local workers.

""We give a five-star experience, I feel, to visitors in Hawaii, in Maui especially,"" Patel says. ""The return back to the community, for meeting some of their basic needs, hasn't been five-star.""

Locals say that lots of people come to Maui to get a nice experience they can take home, but don't bother to learn about this place in a deep way or invest anything besides tourism dollars.

Patel says the disaster presents an opportunity to change that dynamic.

""Right now is not the time for small changes,"" he says. ""It's the time for big, drastic changes that are going to be shifts for generations to come.""

He thinks Maui can be the model for that.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR

One model that you hear a lot of chatter about is something called ""regenerative tourism."" Here's how Maui Mayor Richard Bissen explains it to NPR.

""I think the mindset is more of being a guest rather than a tourist,"" Bissen says. ""Let me give you the difference. You folks live in your homes and you have friends that come to your home and they come over as guests and they treat your home a certain way or else you wouldn't let them in your home.""

Regenerative tourism would be less extractive and more sustainable, he says, with a focus on the rich culture, history, and environment here. For instance, tourists might volunteer to remove invasive species, reforest the landscape, or restore cultural artifacts.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR

Mayor Bissen says while discussions continue about Maui's long-term economic strategy, the recovery itself can help fuel the economy in the short-term.

""We're going to have a lot of construction work, just to rebuild what we lost,"" he says. Bissen's roots are deep on Maui as both of his parents were born here and he spent his formative years on the island.

""I'm not saying that's going to replace tourism. I'm just saying that's the reality: we will be building and rebuilding. And that should obviously bring money into the economy, provide jobs.""

The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement (CNHA) is trying to connect locals to those jobs. CEO Kuhio Lewis walks into a strip mall storefront that his group has converted into a classroom.

""Aloha, aloha,"" he's greeted by two men and two women who are there getting hazmat certifications.

People who lost their livelihoods to the fires can come here, at no cost, to get certified to work in the cleanup.

That might include getting a commercial truck drivers' license, or completing an occupational safety program required for jobs like clean up and debris removal at the Lahaina burn site.

Lewis says that when the fires hit, his organization sprang into action.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR Deanne Fitzmaurice for NPR

""This is a sense of kuleana,"" Lewis says, using the Hawaiian word for responsibility. ""That's just the familial ties and relationships that we share with each other as a Native people.""

He says CNHA has raised more than $20 million in private donations from around the world to support their fire relief efforts.

""The goal here is to provide Maui residents with the tools that they need to be part of their own solution,"" says Lewis. ""Rather than outside mainland corporations or workers coming to take these jobs.""

Lewis, who is 40, says stabilizing the economy is key to Maui's future.

And he, too, thinks the long-term solution is embracing regenerative tourism.

""It's about hearing the stories of this place, the history of this place, connecting to the land and the people,"" Lewis argues. He says that's especially true of a place like Lahaina – which has a rich history as the one-time capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. ""That's the Hawaii that I believe everybody fell in love with. But now it's become like Mai Tais in Waikiki.""

Lewis received a state government contract back in May — before the fires — to rethink what tourism could like for all of Hawaii. He's calling that project Kilohana, and its goal is ""to overhaul Hawai'i's approach to destination stewardship, visitor management, and marketing to better share our cultural heritage and values in a way that enriches the lives of residents and visitors.""

He says that as unfortunate as this disaster has been, it underscored the need to think about these issues. Especially at a time when locals are contemplating whether they'll stay on Maui.

""They're thinking about their quality of life,"" says Lewis. ""They are thinking about their future generations and it's still unclear as to what's going to happen, so you can't blame them if they want to move."""

The 100-basis-point hike to 16% was the fifth rate rise since summer as the central bank grapples with accelerating inflation, which rose to 7.5% year-on-year in November. Moscow has, nevertheless, outpaced expectations despite Western sanctions following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine."

Pernell Robert Galloway, 54, was sentenced to 131 months in prison. Cassie Louise McKenzie, 42, was sentenced to 115 months.

Court documents say the investigation began in 2023 after law enforcement managers were told the managers were selling drugs from the hotel, located on Highway 90. A search was conducted on June 8, leading to the discovery of the following items:

14 grams of a meth, separated into two separate bags

a firearm

digital scales

additional unused baggies for distribution

Galloway and McKenzie were indicted by a federal grand jury and pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.

The case was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Hancock County Sheriff’s Office.

INDIANAPOLIS (WISH) — Businesses in and around Downtown are getting ready to welcome more than 100 thousand people for All-Star Weekend. With that comes a potential multi-million dollar impact on the local economy.

The NBA wants to let local shops and restaurants get in on the action with the help of its All-Star Rewards Program.

One of the participating businesses, Artisians, is a gift shop on Massachusettes Avenue. Owner Jennifer McDaniel says they’re looking forward to a busy weekend.

“You can just tell already, with just people getting ready — there’s just a buzz,” McDaniel said.

According to Pacers Sports and Entertainment Vice President of External Affairs Danny Lopez, the event can potentially bring a $320 million economic boost to the city.

“[It’s] a big deal for a market like ours,” Lopez said. “[We’re] really trying to tell more than a basketball story, but to talk about all the great things that we have here … all of the arts and culture that we’ve created over time, those are the stories that we’re going to tell.”

All-Star Rewards for Indy launched back in July 2023. McDaniel signed up her shop for the program a few months ago.

The foot traffic alone from major events does wonders for her business. She says the incentive could bring even more new shoppers along Mass. Ave.

“All of that’s really going to help give us you know, a little bit of exposure,” McDaniel said. “People go ‘Oh, my God, that’s a great place. I mean, I might buy online, too’ … You just don’t know what to expect. But we’re ready. We’re ready to go.”

In total, 400 locations are participating in rewards between shops, restaurants, and landmarks like the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in New Castle.

“It’s really cool,“ McDaniel said. “They can just scan the QR code and do virtual scratch-offs and earn points and prizes.”

According to Lopez, this year’s program is the biggest the NBA has put on. Meanwhile, more than 15,000 people have already signed up to get rewards."

Feb 02 2024,"Economy started 2024 strong with 353,000 jobs in January",Washington Examiner,right,https://washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/2832255/economy-started-2024-strong-jobsjanuary-employment-growth-slowed-to-xxx-in-january,"The economy crushed expectations in January and added 353,000 jobs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday morning, showing that the labor market started 2024 on strong footing after defying fears of a recession throughout 2023.

The unemployment rate stayed the same at 3.7%. Unemployment remains low by historical standards.

The continued employment growth is good news for the White House, which has been working to credit President Joe Biden for the strong job creation over recent months, characterizing the underlying strength of the labor market and the broader economy as “Bidenomics” in action.

“It’s way better than expected. In fact, it’s so much better I’d call it incredible, as in maybe not entirely credible,” said Dan North, a senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. North said the headline number might be revised down in the months ahead and that some seasonal distortions might be at play.

Friday’s report also showed the estimates for job creation in November and December being revised up by a combined 126,000. Job growth in recent months has been well above the rate needed to keep unemployment trending down over time.

Job growth was led by a 74,000 job increase in professional and business services. But the growth was broad-based, with payrolls growing in healthcare, retail, government, and manufacturing.

Wage growth was strong last month according to the report. Average hourly earnings increased by about double than what was anticipated, rising 0.6%. On an annual basis, wages popped 4.5%, above the 4.1% forecast.

In response to the strong labor market report, stock futures were down on Friday. That is because investors fear that stronger wage growth and jobs market tightness could mean that the Fed will hold interest rates higher for longer.

Both job creation and GDP growth have maintained momentum despite the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.

The Fed has carried out an at-times aggressive tightening cycle in response to the inflation that has roiled households over the past few years. Since the central bank began hiking in March 2022, annual inflation, as tracked by the consumer price index, has fallen from a peak of about 9% in June 2022 to just 3.4% in December.

The Fed announced a decision this week to keep its interest rate target steady, a move that led investors to push back the timeline for expected rate hikes to May.

There is also a growing perception that the labor market and economy more broadly will avoid the sort of painful recession some economists had predicted the country would already be enmeshed in right now.

The Fed predicts the unemployment rate will rise to 4.1% by the end of this year. Officials also predict a very modest 1.4% GDP growth in 2024.

Gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. That was down from the 4.9 percent rate in the third quarter but easily topped forecasters’ expectations and showed the resilience of the recovery from the pandemic’s economic upheaval.

The latest reading is preliminary and may be revised in the months ahead.

Forecasters entered 2023 expecting the Federal Reserve’s aggressive campaign of interest-rate increases to push the economy into reverse. Instead, growth accelerated: For the full year, measured from the end of 2022 to the end of 2023, G.D.P. grew 3.1 percent, up from less than 1 percent the year before and faster than the average for the five years preceding the pandemic. (A different measure, based on average output over the full year, showed annual growth of 2.5 percent in 2023.)"
Jan 31 2024,We can still make a good economy much better,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/31/24055562/economy-bill-of-rights-vibecession-progressives-freedom-fdr,"After a confusing few months of surveys suggesting that Americans are unhappy with the economy despite positive signs like low unemployment and rising real wages, the vibes are now improving. Preliminary results from the University of Michigan’s survey of consumer sentiments found that in January, Americans’ regard for the economy reached its highest level in two and a half years.

Even low-income Americans are seeing some of the best labor market conditions in decades, with the rollback of an estimated 40 percent of the wage inequality that built up over the last 40 years. But that doesn’t mean we should abandon the main question raised by the mysterious “vibecession”: Why weren’t people happy about the economy?

Here are some other facts that even a very good economy cannot seem to wipe away: More than 6 million Americans are unemployed; 25.3 million Americans lacked health insurance in the first quarter of 2023 (which is actually a record low); and more than 650,000 Americans experienced homelessness in 2023. And more than 40 million Americans, or 12.4 percent of the population, lived in poverty in 2022, and that’s according to a poverty line that just about everyone agrees is ridiculously outdated and low. Not captured in those statistics are tens of millions of Americans who are living too close to economic deprivation for comfort.

I repeat: The economy is good, and full of things to celebrate. But a good economy and tight labor markets still won’t give us freedom from poverty, homelessness, or insecurity. To achieve those goals, progressives have long advocated for strong direct government action. “There’s this missing economic history around the very idea of freedom,” said economist Mark Paul, author of The Ends of Freedom: Reclaiming America’s Lost Promise of Economic Rights. “We’ve had this long struggle around fighting for economic security, or economic rights, here in the US.”

One way to understand what’s still wrong with the economy is to probe the history of one of its unrealized ambitions: an economic bill of rights.

President Roosevelt proposed an economic bill of rights in 1944

“The one supreme objective for the future … can be summed up in one word: security,” announced President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his 1944 state of the union address. “And that means not only physical security … It means also economic security.”

Roosevelt went on to propose a second bill of rights — this one economic — that would enshrine every American’s entitlement to the basics, such as housing, health care, education, and welfare. He’d already made big strides in that direction, however piecemeal, including the 1935 Social Security Act that created Social Security as well as unemployment and welfare benefits. But Roosevelt died in office just over a year after his 1944 speech, leaving his vision for an economic bill of rights unfulfilled.

Even before his death, however, Roosevelt had already withdrawn his support for reducing the work week, instead focusing on full-time employment for all with rising wages. That shift helped cement the framework we still use today to evaluate what makes a “good economy,” which boils down to improvements in the unemployment rate, wages, GDP, and inflation.

Decades after Roosevelt, the civil rights movement picked up the idea of economic rights. In a 1967 address, Martin Luther King Jr. described the bond between civil and economic rights. “No matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all poverty,” he said. The solution embraced by the movement was a 1966 proposal drafted by the activists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin: A “Freedom Budget” for All Americans.

The Freedom Budget was a revival of Roosevelt’s economic bill of rights, outlining seven core objectives that covered most of the same terrain, with additional emphasis on reducing pollution, to be achieved within 10 years. By the end of his life, such a program had become a core priority for King — his last written work before his assassination in 1968 was the posthumously published “We Need an Economic Bill of Rights.”

But the economy was already heading in a much different direction. The idea for an economic bill of rights faded as economic policy entered its neoliberal period in the 1970s. Rather than enshrining access to basic needs and economic rights for all, free markets and full-time employment were touted as the road to achieving economic security.

Now, half a century later, the economic consensus is shifting yet again.

Economic rights, today

From Oxford’s Institute for New Economic Thinking to the conservative think tank American Compass, a bipartisan slate of organizations have been announcing the end of neoliberalism for years now. But no one is really sure what comes next.

The president’s “Bidenomics” plans do suggest a new direction, embracing the pillars of public investment, empowering workers, and promoting competition. But a recent report from the progressive Roosevelt Institute argued that “these pillars will be insufficient to move us toward a truly progressive, post-neoliberal economy.” Securing that transition, it asserts, would benefit from “direct public provision” of goods and services, like health care, rather than relying on stimulating market mechanisms with tax credits. In addition, the authors call for more progressive taxation, and more democratic governance structures that can tilt the economy’s direction toward the public good.

Roosevelt’s vision of economic security for all could help bridge the gap between Bidenomics and progressive proposals. The idea has already been seeing a revival: When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced their Green New Deal in 2019, they included economic rights, stating that achieving the legislation’s goals would require providing all people of the United States with high-quality health care, a job guarantee, housing, economic security, clean water and air, and healthy and affordable food.

A few months later, Bernie Sanders invoked Roosevelt’s speech directly in one of his own, calling for a 21st-century economic bill of rights. “We must take the next step forward and guarantee every man, woman, and child in our country basic economic rights,” he said.

But the clearest articulation yet is in Mark Paul’s book, which, after naming what might be included in an economic bill of rights — including the rights to work, housing, education, health care, basic income and banking, and a healthy environment — devotes a chapter to each on the question of “How?”

The path to a fairer economy

Some of these goals could be implemented as a single policy. Medicare-for-all bills, which would effectively create a right to health care, are already plentiful thanks to being a spotlight issue in the 2020 Democratic primary. Basic income policies could also help establish the right to a guaranteed minimum income.

Other goals lack a single flagship policy. Paul explains that the right to a healthy environment, for example, depends on the trio of green investment, smart regulations, and carbon pricing. Or consider the task of guaranteeing housing for all, which Paul argues needs six separate policies. Of the six, he emphasizes a huge, green buildout of social housing — similar to what exists in Vienna, where social housing has created something of a “renters’ utopia” — and rent control.

“Progressives do not have the power — at least not yet — to win an economic bill of rights,” he concedes. “To see poverty eradicated, progressives will have to continue pressing their case — via mass movements and grassroots organizing, over the dinner table, and in the public sphere.”

But the history of the pursuit of economic rights suggests that what may look like bold progressive demands today are, in fact, quite old. And what’s more, they’re deeply rooted in what historian Eric Foner has called the “master narrative” of American history: freedom. “True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,” Roosevelt said in his 1944 address. “Necessitous men are not free men.”

Mar 12 2024,"Elderly retirees face big losses after Chinese trust goes bust, reflecting turbulent economy",Quartz,center,https://qz.com/elderly-retirees-face-big-losses-after-chinese-trust-go-1851330814,"CHENGDU, China (AP) — Some investors in a troubled trust fund in China are facing financial ruin under a government plan to return a fraction of their money, casualties of a slump in the property industry and a broader economic slowdown.

Sichuan Trust, headquartered in the southwest city of Chengdu, announced it was insolvent in 2020, stricken by sketchy accounting and failed investments in shopping malls and other projects. A deadline earlier this month to accept a 20%-60% “haircut” or loss on their investments has left some investors in deep financial trouble, according to public announcements and AP interviews with five people affected.

China’s economy, the world’s second largest, depends heavily on real estate development to drive growth and create jobs. Property prices and sales have languished after a crackdown on what leaders viewed as dangerous levels of borrowing, causing dozens of developers to default on their debts.

At the National People's Congress session in Beijing last week, officials pledged to do more to protect investors. Premier Li Qiang said China would work to control risks and resolve the property crisis.

For the people who put their life savings into Sichuan Trust and similar entities, it's likely too late. Around 300 of more than 8,000 investors refused to accept a government plan and are looking for legal help, a relative of one investor said. A few who attempted to come to Beijing during the congress to air their grievances were blocked by police, the relative said.

The ruling Communist Party faces a dilemma: Debt is a problem, but falling home prices lead people to scrimp on spending. That squeezes companies' sales, so they lay off workers and cut back on investment. The result: slowing growth and less wealth to go around.

Inevitably, someone will end up losing out as China’s debt crisis unwinds, said Tsinghua University finance professor Michael Pettis.

“Nobody wants to absorb the loss. If you assign it to households, you weaken consumption even more,” Pettis said. “It’s got to be assigned. And that’s the political problem.""

Trusts are a cross between a bank and an investment fund. Some advertised their offerings as reliable, high interest government-backed accounts. They're actually private entities that fund projects like factories and shopping malls. Weak disclosure requirements allowed them to use money from new investors to pay what they owed earlier ones, a set-up somewhat like a Ponzi scheme.

“Financial supervision was relatively loose in the past, so the design of these products, including systems for protecting investors’ rights and interests, had serious issues,” said Zhu Zhenxin, chief analyst at Rushi Finance Institute in Beijing. “If underlying assets of financial products won't generate enough returns to pay such high interest rates, default is inevitable.”

The troubles at Sichuan Trust first surfaced when the government began restricting new sales of trust products in 2020. Without revenue from new investors, it couldn't pay its outstanding debts.

That summer, Sichuan Trust announced it had 25.3 billion RMB ($3.5 billion at the time) in debts it couldn't repay. The provincial government and banking regulators took control, ousting the management, reorganizing its books and launching an investigation.

Hundreds of investors staged weekly protests outside the company’s headquarters and their losses became a political issue.

In 2021, police detained Sichuan Trust’s majority shareholder Liu Canglong, a mining and real estate tycoon who was once the richest man in Sichuan, a province of more than 80 million people. He is accused of embezzling trust funds.

In December, the trust announced it would return investors’ funds according to a sliding scale of the original investment. The larger the investment stake, the larger the loss.

That sparked more protests.

“We’re extremely anxious,” one investor who asked not to be named told The AP. “It’s so cruel, the amount of money they’re giving us is so little.”

A person answering Sichuan Trust's hotline said the company does not take interviews and would not provide comment. Sichuan Trust, the Sichuan provincial government and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission did not respond to faxed and emailed requests for comment.

The plan to return funds “appropriately favors small and medium-sized investors,” Sichuan Trust said earlier in a public statement, calling it “fair.”

Those protesting fear say they've been harassed and intimidated, subjected to police interrogations and threats from their children’s employers. They've been barred from leaving Chengdu or, at times, their housing compounds.

On a recent visit to the company's headquarters, dozens of uniformed officers, half a dozen police vehicles and an empty bus were parked outside. More than a dozen plainclothes agents who refused to identify themselves followed two AP journalists around.

Earlier, a Dutch journalist was shoved to the ground and forced into a police vehicle when he attempted to approach protesting investors.

“They abduct you, they threaten your children,” said another investor, who also did not want to be identified due to fears of more police harassment. “They have so many dirty tricks.”

Advertisement

Analysts say investors were bound to suffer big losses given the size of Sichuan Trust’s debts. Chinese media have reported on the problem, but focused on alleged wrongdoing by those who ran the trust, presenting the repayment plan as a fair solution.

Some of the more than 95% of investors who signed off on the plan said they agreed under duress and were threatened with bigger losses if they didn't meet a March 5 deadline.

Trusts have a high minimum investment — for Sichuan Trust it was generally 300,000 yuan ($42,000) — and many people believed mostly the relatively well-off were affected.

However, some investors were retirees who said they met the investment threshhold by collecting money from friends and relatives who now want their money back. For them, Sichuan Trust’s default is a calamity.

“They’re so poor, they don’t have money to spend,” said a relative of investors who lost money to the trust. “They don’t have money for medical treatment. They have to borrow money to survive.”

Those interviewed said the name Sichuan Trust led them to believe it was a trustworthy financial institution like a bank, with a steady, fixed interest rates, rather than a risky investment fund. They were attracted by the 8% or 9% interest rates it promised – multiple times higher than traditional savings accounts. Some financially unsophisticated retirees invested large chunks of their life savings.

“The country said trusts are very safe, like banks,"" one of the people said. “We didn't think there would be problems.”

Instead of enjoying their retirements, two of the people said, they've had to borrow money from relatives and cut back on their expenses.

Advertisement

“We ordinary people are miserable,” another investor said. “The corruption is so serious.”

China's roughly $3 trillion trust sector is part of a large “shadow banking” industry in the country, which for decades supplied credit to entrepreneurs and households not served by the state-run banking system. Concerned over speculation and illegal practices, authorities have tightened controls. In 2020, regulators declared victory in cleaning up China's online peer-to-peer lending industry, or P2P.

Advertisement

Wealth management companies also have gotten into trouble.

“We believe risks could increase, potentially affecting more financial-sector entities, if China’s economic recovery continues to lose momentum and the property sector’s distress is sustained,” Fitch Ratings said in a report after the collapse of another big trust company, Zhengrong.

Officials and analysts say crackdowns have been necessary, but investors footing the bill are questioning how they've been carried out.

“I support the Communist Party very much,"" one of the investors said. “But some people are blackening the Party's name.”

The report stated there will be a downshift in the economy and the growth will come more from local sources, including the construction to rebuild Lahaina.

According to the forecast, “on the Valley Isle, the initial visitor recovery after the wildfires has proven somewhat stronger than expected, but rebuilding will take a long time, with many uncertainties about how this will play out.”

The state saw near-historic highs with real visitor spending in the first quarter, even though visitor arrivals fell during the second half of 2023.

Reports showed an uptick in Canadian and Japanese visitors, but trends of poor purchasing power of foreign currencies proved to remain a challenge.

The UHERO forecast also revealed that the construction industry will reach new heights as well.

Over $500 million will be utilized for the Maui Interim Housing Plan for debris removal, rebuilding permits, and to address the housing shortage.

The state will also be increasing restrictions on short-term rentals to push property owners back to long-term housing.

The labor market amongst the islands proved to be both steady and healthy, as employment increased on Big Island, Oahu, and Kauai.

To meet the building needs of both Maui and Oahu, 2500 workers will be added to crews over the next three years to contribute to the Maui Interim Project and other housing projects.

Amid deflationary risks, a prolonged downturn in the real estate market and dampened business confidence, Li said the government was “keenly aware” of the challenges ahead.

Opening the annual session of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, Li said the government was aiming for around 5 per cent growth, roughly as much as it grew in 2023.

“Global economic growth lacks steam and the regional hotspot issues keep erupting. This has made China’s external environment more complex, severe and uncertain,” he said.

But there was no announcement of any splashy quick fixes. The government would press on with a “proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy”, the premier said, suggesting no major change in the leadership’s approach to the economy.

That strategy was reflected in other targets. As in 2023, the government is aiming for an urban unemployment rate of around 5.5 per cent and is pushing for the creation of more than 12 million new jobs in cities this year. The goal is in range of the 11 million target and 12.44 million jobs created last year, according to official data.

Inflation is forecast to be around 3 per cent, the same target as 2023, and well above the mere 0.2 per cent actual inflation of last year.

China kept its headline fiscal deficit at last year’s 3 per cent target.

But China will issue 1 trillion yuan (US$139 billion) in central government special bonds and 3.9 trillion yuan in local government ones.

In addition, it announced it would issue “ultra-long term special treasury bonds” starting this year and over each of the next several years, in order to “systematically address funding shortage facing major projects”, according to the work report.

Many analysts noted the GDP target was “ambitious” given the high base, lack of effective measures to turn around the faltering property sector and China’s increasing trade frictions with the United States and Europe.

“It is very likely that the announcements will disappoint the market,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist with Greater China at Standard Chartered.

“However, the government has reiterated several times that it will not launch a strong stimulus.”

Instead, the work report and the budget released by the National Development and Reform Commission on Tuesday signalled the government was doubling down on structural change, channelling more funds to the science and technology needed to make that wholesale economic transition.

“Beijing’s budget inclination on technology, education, national defence and agriculture is in line with its current moves to ward off external shocks and increase strategic investment,” Ding added.

As its top task this year, Beijing vowed to modernise industry and develop “new quality productive forces” at a faster pace, a reference to sectors that depend on advances in science and technology, from new-energy vehicles to biomanufacturing and commercial space flight.

Emerging from the opening ceremony, Science Minister Yin Hejun said he welcomed the 8.1 per cent increase in national investment in research and development last year and called for more funding to spur innovation by young researchers.

According to the budget report, the central government will increase R&D spending by 10 per cent to 370.8 billion yuan this year and promote national champions.

The allocations align with a push for self-reliance on fronts from chipmaking to artificial intelligence to counter tech containment from the West and to wrest technological supremacy from the US, according to analysts.

“Recent experience surrounding the trade war and tech war versus the US has exposed China’s vulnerability to technology ‘choke points’, supply chain disruptions and probably intelligence theft, which alarmed leaders,” said Tianchen Xu, from the Economist Intelligence Unit.

“For technology in particular, policymakers’ anxiety is probably aggravated by recent advancements in generative AI, which created concerns that China might lag behind further in cutting-edge technologies.”

Other elements of the work and budget reports – from expanding grain and energy reserves to creating more jobs and minimising risks from local government debt – reflect the leadership’s pursuit of stability, according to an economist from a leading university in Beijing.

“It suggests leaders are not very concerned with short-term economic problems. They are more troubled by longer-term challenges, posed by internal and external factors,” he said on condition of anonymity.

Huang Shouhong, director of the State Council Research Office, said the economic goals were realistic and achievable, though challenging.

“We have been going through all kinds of difficulties and gained rich experience [in managing the economy,” Huang said after the NPC opening.

“Our financial status is generally sound, with relatively large room to accommodate macro policies in the future.

“If unexpected events affect the economy, or unexpected changes happen to the international environment, there are reserved tools in our policy toolbox.”

Also in the work report, the government raised opposition to “external interference” in Taiwan, which will inaugurate independence-leaning William Lai Ching-te as president in May. The island has long been a source of tensions with the United States, which is Taiwan’s primary supplier of arms.

On Hong Kong, Li said the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” should be firmly enforced. Beijing would continue to support the economic development of Hong Kong and Macau, and develop the Greater Bay Area, he added.

On Tuesday, the Hang Seng Index experienced its biggest fall since January 17, dropping 2.6 per cent, whereas China’s CSI 300 Index, which replicates the performance of the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, edged up by 0.7 per cent."

In addition to Mayor Dave Bronson, seven of the nine candidates challenging Bronson on the April 2 ballot were on hand, including Bill Popp, Suzanne LaFrance, Chris Tuck, Breck Craig, Dustin Darden, Jenny Di Grappa and Phil Isley. Two other candidates, Nick Danger and Darin Colbry were not present.

Popp, the former head of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation, said focusing on workforce development would be a top priority. Popp said addressing many of the city’s issues depends on finding people to fill the jobs.

“Bottom line, without workers to fill the jobs, investment will not come here,” Popp said. “Companies are looking to invest in communities that have a growing and vibrant workforce with the skill sets that they need and right now we are going the opposite direction, losing 1 out of 10 working-age adults that we had just 10 years ago. It is the critical issue of our time.”

Popp said attracting and retaining a workforce that is grown locally should be the ultimate goal.

Former Anchorage Assembly Chair LaFrance agreed that outward migration, especially of working-age Alaskans, is a major issue for the city and state. She added that young people also need a reason to stay.

“It comes down to quality of life and affordability,” she said. “So we need to ensure that Anchorage is a place where people want to live, and again, it comes down to the basics, ensuring that the streets are plowed and that those services that everyone relies upon are provided.”

LaFrance said another key is having housing that young Alaskans can afford.

Former state representative Chris Tuck said education should be central to efforts to bolster the economy.

“From Pre-K all the way up through our university, job training and workforce development,” Tuck said. “Another key component of that is affordable, reliable energy. We need that infrastructure in place because businesses aren’t going to want to develop here or start here unless we have that reliable, affordable energy.”

Mayor Dave Bronson listed some specific accomplishments he’s made in office including forming an energy task force and efforts to increase the housing stock in Anchorage.

In response to a question about balancing economic development with Anchorage’s cultural heritage, the mayor said the two are not mutually exclusive. He said he is working on a plan to expand access to one of Anchorage’s cultural hubs.

“That’s why I’ve spent $25,000 on a feasibility study to bring the Alaska Native Heritage Center back to downtown or to downtown, where it always should have been,” Bronson said. “Our tourists who experience cultural tourism should not have to get on a bus and drive five or six miles to experience that.”

Bronson said the move would likely mean more tourist dollars flowing into downtown Anchorage.

Candidates were also asked about their positions on a possible sales tax. Some said the city isn’t doing the best job of spending the money it has now, including LaFrance.

“The first thing we have to do is do a better job of providing services for the money that the taxpayers are paying,” LaFrance said. “And we also need to think about what’s the best way to invest in ourselves and what will give us the best return.”

LaFrance didn’t say whether she favored a tax but Popp was more enthusiastic.

“A year-round sales tax with almost 20% of it being paid by people who don’t live in Anchorage is a tax break for the citizens,” Popp said. “And these are things that we should be having a long conversation about — at least a year’s worth — before we take it for a vote.”

Tuck was less direct. When questioned, he cited his legislative experience.

“We passed a fiscal plan, one of the first fiscal plans in state history,” he said. “One of the things we did was make sure we were efficient, and we managed cuts before we started asking people to pay for more.”

Tuck said, if needed, he would prefer a seasonal sales tax.

Mayor Bronson said the city had a spending problem it needed to get under control.

“Spending is the challenge,” Bronson said. “I could support a seasonal sales tax if it guaranteed a dollar-for-dollar reduction in property tax.”

On March 13, Alaska’s News Source will televise a debate at 7 p.m. between Bronson, Popp, LaFrance and Tuck. The four candidates qualified because, by the latest APOC filing deadlines, they all had public campaign webpages, a campaign chairperson who is not solely the candidate and a dedicated campaign bank account.

Feb 25 2024,EPA finalizes air pollution standards that critics say will cost jobs and hurt the economy,Just The News,right,https://justthenews.com/politics-policy/environment/epa-finalizes-air-pollution-standars-critics-say-will-cost-jobs-and,"The EPA finalized air pollution standards that create more stringent limits for soot exposure, as it is called. This despite a 42% decrease in the national average over the last 22 years, according to the agency’s own data.

“It’s going to hurt economies. It’s going to hurt manufacturing. It’s a real problem,” Daren Bakst, senior fellow with the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), told Just The News.

The Clean Air Act requires the EPA every five years to do a complete review of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six common pollutants, which includes particulate matter.

The NAAQS for particulate matter, sometimes referred to as PM2.5, deal with solid particles and liquid droplets that are a fraction of the width of a human hair and are suspended in the air. These particles are emitted from construction sites, unpaved roads, agriculture fields, smokestacks and fires.

The new standards lowered the fine particulate matter from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. That means under the new standards, in one cubic foot of air, there can only be 0.00000026 grams of particulate matter.

According to the EPA, particulate matter can cause premature death in people with heart or lung disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, decreased lung function, and respiratory problems.

The standards, the EPA argues, will help avoid 4,500 premature deaths, 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, and 290,000 lost workdays — all by 2032. This will save $22 billion to $46 billion in healthcare costs, and cost $590 million to implement.

“The most vulnerable among us are most at risk from exposure to particulate matter, and that’s why it’s so important we take a hard look at these standards that haven’t been updated in nine years,” said EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan, in a statement announcing the initiation of the review.

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) disputed the EPA’s figures on cost of compliance. Citing a NAM-commissioned analysis by Oxford Economics, NAM argues the standards could reduce GDP by nearly $200 billion and cost as many as 1 million jobs through 2031.

According to the EPA, 119 counties are currently out of compliance with the standards, many of them in California.

NAM argues that as many as 200 counties will be out of compliance, and those that are marginally in compliance will have to reconsider investments in industry and jobs to avoid falling out of compliance.

A study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that the standards would put 386 to 569 counties out of compliance with the standards. “From requiring small businesses like restaurants to install costly equipment, homeowners to replace wood fireplaces with natural gas logs, and states to pave unpaved roads, this rule will impact many sectors of our economy,” the report stated.

As much as 30% of all counties in the U.S., the report says, would have to block permitting of manufacturing facilities and new infrastructure projects.

Writing on the CEI blog, Bakst explained that the rules were reviewed in 2020 after an extensive process involving input from the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the EPA decided to keep the standards where they were.

Rather than stick to the five-year timeline set by Congress, right about the time Biden took office, the EPA decided to review the standards that the EPA had retained under the Trump administration.

“This grave mistake will drive investment away from the United States, derail permitting and weaken the economy for all,” Jay Timmons, CEO and president of NAM, said in a statement.

When asked about the potential economic consequences, which critics say will undermine the positive health outcomes of the rules, the EPA said in a statement to Just The News the standards were based on the “best available science and reflect input from the public as well as scientific experts.”

“Scientific evidence shows that long- and short-term exposures to PM2.5 can harm people’s health,” the EPA said in the statement.

This includes health impacts, the EPA said to ,”overburdened communities, including many communities of color and low-income communities throughout the United States.”

Prior to EPA announcing it was initiating a review of the standards, The Washington Post reported, EPA administrator Michael Regan dismissed 40 outside experts from advisory boards, including the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, who were researchers picked under the Trump administration. Critics had complained that the picks were weighted toward regulated industry and they took positions questioning the climate crisis.

The Biden administration, the Post reported, said the move would reestablish scientific integrity across the federal government.

Bakst argued the EPA filled the panel with members that would be more favorable to the administration’s agenda without regard to the scientific merits of their positions. “They got rid of every single person that provides advice on science. It’s got the appearance of gutting and putting your own people on so you can get the feedback you want,” Bakst said.

John Graham, who Trump had appointed to lead the EPA’s Science Advisory Board, told The New York Times that the dismissals were “very sad.”

“Now for the first time in the agency’s 50-year history, we have an administrator interested in scientific advice only from those scientists he has personally appointed,” Graham told the Times.

Bakst added that by pushing up the Congressionally mandated five-year timeline for the reviews, the EPA isn’t allowing for the time needed to do a careful, science-based review of the previous standards and what the economic consequences will be of the new standards.

“Americans are struggling. The economy is not flourishing, and the Biden administration is making things worse, as opposed to taking their time and thinking it through,” Bakst said."

Jan 03 2024,Economy — is 2024 going to be the year of the recession?,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/wex-mas-2024-year-recession,"In the spirit of the season, the Washington Examiner has identified 12 issues we believe will shape 2024 — and beyond. These close-up examinations of agenda-setting issues cover everything from the ongoing battle between the Biden family’s business deals and Republican Oversight, the emergence of a “new world order,” and fights over redistricting and new election maps. Part eight is about whether there might be a recession in 2024, a critical election year.

The United States avoided a recession in 2023, but the economy is still not out of the woods heading into a 2024 filled with uncertainties.

The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to highs not seen since before the Great Recession. The Fed’s current rate target is 5.25% to 5.50%, a level designed to tamp down demand and thus inflation. Historically, though, rate-hiking cycles raise the risk of an economic downturn.



TWELVE DAYS OF WEX-MAS: DEMOCRATS REBRANDING CANDIDATES AS TOUGH ON CRIME AHEAD OF 2024 RACE



As the calendar flipped from 2022 to 2023, a large number of economists predicted that the U.S. would already be in the throes of a recession by now, but economic growth has instead continued at a robust clip.

As a rule of thumb, recessions are typically, though not always, marked by two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product growth.

Gross domestic product expanded at a 4.9% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2023 — the strongest growth since the country’s pandemic rebound. GDP growth was 2.1% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the first quarter of last year. The Atlanta Fed’s “GDP Now” tracker predicts that GDP growth in the final quarter will be 2.3%.

But there is still much uncertainty for what lies ahead in 2024.

While the Fed has raised interest rates to high levels, it takes time for those rate hikes to filter through to the general economy. The majority of economists predict that some of that downward pressure will dampen economic growth heading into the new year and could even be enough to tip the U.S. into a recession, although most of those forecasting a recession expect it to be a mild one.

In a recent report, Wells Fargo economists point out that the Leading Economic Index, tracked in concert with the Conference Board, has declined for 20 consecutive months — a pattern that would indicate that a recession is imminent.

The economists note that the “historically reliable” indicator has been flashing a recession warning for some time.

“Yet despite the persistent warning signs from the LEI, economic growth has continued to strengthen,” the report reads. “The question as we turn to 2024 is will this period be classified as one in which the LEI cried wolf, or will we look back and cheer its steadfast signal at a time when broader economic conditions showed resiliency?”

Of note, the Fed is likely to begin cutting rates next year as inflation continues to meaningfully fall. Central bank officials are penciling in three rate cuts in 2024, although investors expect double the number of cuts.

Investors now see a nearly 83% probability that the Fed will cut rates in or before March, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which calculates the probability using futures contract prices for rates in the short-term market targeted by the Fed.

Investors are also pegging near-certain odds that the Fed will trim at least a full percentage point off of its target rate, with a high probability of even deeper cuts.

More rate cuts would bode well for the markets, although, perhaps the biggest uncertainty is whether inflation, which has been trending down, unexpectedly rises again, forcing the Fed to hold rates higher for longer. That would not bode well for a soft landing.

Rodney Lake, vice dean for undergraduate programs at George Washington University and director of the university’s Investment Institute, told the Washington Examiner that he is in the soft-landing camp.

“I think there is likely to be a very soft landing and potential mild recession, but all economic indicators look very positive as far as unemployment, inflation easing, and companies’ overall fundamentals looking good,” Lake said.

And the labor market has remained strong despite the rate hikes, which began in earnest back in March 2022. The economy broke expectations again in November and added nearly 200,000 jobs. The unemployment rate also dropped slightly to 3.7%, right around where it was in the months before the pandemic.

A recession, meaning a downturn in output that also drives up unemployment, would be a major problem for President Joe Biden’s reelection efforts.

Biden has been getting very low marks on his handling of the economy, likely due in big part to the inflationary scourge that has torn through the country. While inflation has moderated, people are still paying much more for goods than they were when he took office.

Inflation has overshadowed the strong job market, but if there is a recession and people start ending up out of work, it would only increase the magnitude of voters’ anger over how the administration is handling the economy. The Republican nominee for president would invariably use a recession as a cudgel to attack Biden as the year inches closer to Election Day.

Still, as inflation keeps falling and with the expectation of interest rate cuts, more and more economists are expressing optimism that a recession can be avoided.

“High interest rates will remain a drag on consumer spending growth in the near term, although that drag has lessened somewhat as long-term rates have moved lower toward the end of 2023,” PNC chief economist Gus Faucher said. “Another constraint on spending growth will be the need for households to increase their saving. But overall, it looks like the U.S. economy is moving toward slower growth, but no recession, in 2024.”"

(KIFI) – Wyoming’s economy is growing and its future is bright, Governor Mark Gordon said in his 2024 State of the State speech.

Gordon said Wyoming’s GDP is the highest in history and unemployment is as low as it has been since 2008.

“Wyoming is open for business, constantly seeking to innovate and improve,” the governor said. “I can proudly say, Wyoming is on a roll.”

Given this is a Budget Session of the Legislature, Governor Gordon urged Legislators to focus on that key task and pass the budget he presented.

“I am confident the task at hand, setting the budget for the next two years, is serious enough that folks will keep their attention on meeting the needs of the people of Wyoming. This is not Washington — Wyoming folks are focused on solutions not politics,” Governor Gordon said.

He said his proposed budget takes on significant needs like property tax relief, targeting those truly in need. He also asked the Legislature to be mindful of the potential impacts to county resources, roads and schools when considering Legislation that addresses high property taxes."

Feb 02 2024,"Economy beats expectations again, adding 353,000 jobs in January",Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2024/02/02/january-jobs-report-335000-beats-expectations-soft-landing-economy,"The nation’s employers delivered a stunning burst of hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign of the economy’s continuing ability to shrug off the highest interest rates in two decades.

Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that last month’s job gain topped the 333,000 that were added in December, a figure that was itself revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, just above a half-century low.

The latest gains far exceeded expectations and showcased employers’ willingness to keep hiring to meet steady consumer spending. It comes as the intensifying presidential campaign is pivoting in no small part on views of President Joe Biden’s economic stewardship. Public polls show widespread dissatisfaction largely because even though inflation has sharply slowed, most prices remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Some recent surveys, though, show public approval gradually improving.

This week, the Federal Reserve took note of the economy’s durability, with Chair Jerome Powell saying “the economy is performing well, the labor market remains strong.” The Fed made clear that while it’s nearing a long-awaited shift toward cutting interest rates, it’s in no hurry to do so.

To fight inflation, the Fed raised its benchmark rate 11 times beginning in March 2022. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to boost unemployment and likely cause a recession. Yet the economy has managed to produce enough job growth to avoid a recession without accelerating inflation pressures. Inflation cooled throughout 2023, making it likelier that the Fed would achieve a “soft landing” — taming inflation without derailing the economy.

A series of high-profile layoff announcements, from the likes of UPS, Google and Amazon, have raised some concerns about whether they might herald the start of a wave of job cuts. Yet measured against the nation’s vast labor force, the recent layoffs haven’t been significant enough to make a dent in the overall job market. Historically speaking, layoffs are still relatively low, hiring is still solid and the unemployment rate is still consistent with a healthy economy.

Consumers as a whole have proved more resilient than expected in the face of the Fed’s rate hikes. Having socked away savings during the pandemic, most were willing to spend it as the economy reopened. And a wave of early retirements, some of them related to COVID-19, limited the number of people available for work and contributed to a tight labor market.

The gradual improvement in public confidence has emerged in a series of recent surveys. A measure of consumer sentiment by the University of Michigan has jumped in the past two months by the most since 1991. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that Americans’ inflation expectations have reached their lowest point in nearly three years. And a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 35% of U.S. adults call the national economy good, up from 30% who said so late last year.

The rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs, considered a reliable predictor of wage trends, has slowed to pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that workers have grown somewhat less confident of finding a better job elsewhere. Employers, as a result, may be less likely to feel pressure to raise wages to keep them —and to increase their prices to make up for their higher labor costs. That cycle can perpetuate inflation."
Feb 02 2024,"Economy added booming 353K jobs in January, unemployment held at 3.7%.","""USA Today"" Contributor",left,https://usatoday.com/story/money/2024/02/02/jobs-report-january/72443647007,"Hiring picked up sharply in January as employers added a booming 353,000 jobs, highlighting a labor market that continues to defy high interest rates and household financial strains.

The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated that 185,000 jobs were added last month.

The surprisingly strong showing was driven by big payroll increases in health care and professional services but was also boosted by some quirky factors linked to holiday hiring that may not persist in the coming months.

Still, the performance wasn't a one-month blip. Job gains for November and December were revised up by a whopping 126,000, with the December tally upgraded to 333,000 from 216,000. The changes portray a stronger labor market in the fall than previously believed.

""The revision of last month’s numbers added to today’s report make clear the economy is breaking new ground,"" says Jane Oates, president of WorkingNation, a nonprofit that raises awareness about the challenges facing U.S. workers and former head of the Labor Department’s employment and training division.

Are wages catching up to inflation?

Average hourly pay also rose sharply, climbing 19 cents to $34.55 and pushing up the yearly increase to 4.5% from an upwardly revised 4.3%. Since the spring of last year, pay increases have outpaced still-high inflation, giving consumers more purchasing power.

Is the Fed expected to cut rates?

The blockbuster job and wage gains could make the Federal Reserve warier about cutting interest rates anytime soon. The Fed tentatively plans to lower rates three times this year but said this week that a March cut is unlikely because officials want to ensure a pandemic-related inflation spike has been tamed for the long term.

""With blowout payrolls, a large upward revision, and a low unemployment rate, dreams of imminent Fed rate cuts are likely to be crushed by today's report,"" Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.

He doesn't expect the Fed to start reducing rates until the third quarter.

But other economists are still betting the central bank will act in May. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week that a strong economy and job market can coexist with easing inflation and would not discourage officials from cutting as long as price increases continue to slow.

Since pay gains feed into inflation, January's rise in wage growth poses concerns. But the Fed will be focused mostly on whether inflation reports over the next few months show a continued slowdown, says Nationwide economist Kathy Bostjancic.

What sectors are adding the most jobs?

Last month, professional and business services led the job gains with 74,000. Health care added 70,000; retail, 45,000; social assistance, 30,000; and manufacturing, 23,000.

Federal, state and local governments added 36,000 jobs.

In recent months, industries that are less sensitive to rate increases and the economy’s ups and downs – such as government, health care, and social assistance – have accounted for the bulk of U.S. job growth lately. That pattern persisted to some extent last month but job gains were broader -- based on professional services and manufacturers hiring lots of workers.

How many hours a week do most Americans work?

One glaring weakness in the report: The average workweek fell from 34.3 hours to 34.1 hours, the lowest since the depths of the pandemic in March 2020. It's unusual for employers to be giving workers fewer hours at the same time they're adding lots of employees.

At least a partial answer is that companies are still smarting from severe pandemic-induced labor shortages over the past two years and are reluctant to let workers go even if their sales are flagging, Bostjancic says. They even may be adding some workers as they eye a pickup in demand down the road.

Since businesses have a surplus of employees, they're giving each fewer hours on average. That could signal slower hiring in the months ahead.

Yet economist Lydia Boussour of EY-Parthenon says unusually cold weather last month likely played a role in the reduced hours.

How does weather affect employment?

The January totals were expected to be skewed by some unusual crosscurrents.

Cold, snowy weather in the Northeast and Midwest likely dampened employment in industries such as construction and restaurants, Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note. That seemed to play out at least partly, with construction adding a modest 11,000 jobs and restaurants and bars trimming a few thousand.

A further decline was likely because unseasonably warm weather boosted employment in December, setting the stage for a pullback as temperatures returned closer to normal last month, Goldman said.

At the same time, retailers, hotels and trucking companies brought on fewer holiday workers than usual late last year, prompting fewer layoffs in January and lifting employment on a seasonally adjusted basis. That likely swelled payrolls by about 100,000, Goldman figured, more than offsetting the weather-related hit.

What is the hiring projection for 2024?

The bigger picture is that consumer spending and job growth are likely to slow substantially this year as lower- and middle-income households cope with high interest rates, record credit card debt, still-elevated inflation and dwindling pandemic savings.

Moody’s Analytics expects the U.S. to add an average of 72,000 jobs a month, down from 255,000 last year and 399,000 in 2022, as a post-pandemic burst in pent-up spending fades further.

Will there be layoffs in 2024?

Big Tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google have announced thousands of layoffs recently and some economists continue to predict a mild recession in 2024.

But most forecasters believe the nation will avoid a downturn. The same tech giants that are cutting workers in gaming and streaming are beefing up staffs for artificial intelligence and machine learning, says Ger Doyle, senior vice president of Experis, the tech hiring arm of staffing firm ManpowerGroup.

Former President Donald Trump has won the South Carolina Republican primary, defeating the state's former governor, Nikki Haley, NBC News projects. South Carolina's polls closed at 7 p.m. ET, and Trump's victory was projected by networks and wire services within minutes. ""This was a lot sooner than we anticipated,"" Trump said at a party in Columbia, South Carolina following the results. ""It's an early evening and fantastic one."" Trump's widely expected win further cements his status as the likely Republican nominee, though he still needs a total of 1,215 delegates to officially secure the nomination. Just after 10 p.m. ET, Trump was holding a statewide edge of more than 20 points over Haley, according to NBC News. Until then, Haley is determined to keep the GOP primary a two-person race. On Tuesday, Haley pledged to stay on the campaign trail through Super Tuesday on March 5, even if she lost her home state's Saturday primary. After losing to Trump on Saturday, Haley doubled down on that promise.

""I said earlier this week that no matter what happens in South Carolina, I would continue to run for president,"" Haley said in Charleston, South Carolina, after Trump's projected victory. ""I'm a woman of my word."" She added that she would be campaigning in Michigan on Sunday and in various Super Tuesday states throughout the coming week. Haley's campaign confirmed that she has the funding to keep her afloat after a record fundraising month in January. ""We have the resources to go the distance,"" a spokesperson for Haley's campaign told CNBC on Tuesday. The former U.N. ambassador has yet to win a race this primary season, though she managed to pull out a slimmer loss against Trump in New Hampshire due to the state's wide population of undeclared voters. Going into Saturday's primary, South Carolina was much less undecided. Trump held a roughly 30-point lead against Haley, according to a February survey from USA Today and Suffolk University, disintegrating any hopes of her home-court advantage. Trump also had the endorsements of local South Carolina GOP chapters, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace and other lawmakers in the state. Trump also has a healthy track record in the Palmetto State, having won the GOP primary in 2016 and taking 55% of the votes in 2020 against Joe Biden. Where are the candidates on South Carolina's top issues? South Carolinians had immigration and the economy top of mind as they cast their ballots, mirroring sentiments nationwide.

Jan 17 2024,"Jamie Dimon: Trump Right About NATO, Immigration, Economy",Newsmax (News),right,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/j-p-morgan-ceo-jamie-dimon/2024/01/17/id/1149934/,"President Donald Trump's policies generally were ""right"" for the country, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said.

During a CNBC interview conducted Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Dimon discussed the current U.S. economy and politics with the 2024 presidential election little more than nine months away.

He said that many Trump supporters are backing the former president because of his policies, not necessarily his personality.

""I wish the Democrats would think a little bit more carefully when they talk about MAGA,"" Dimon said on CNBC. ""When people say MAGA they're actually looking at people voting for Trump … and basically scapegoating them, that 'you are like him'

""I don't think they're voting for Trump because of his family values. Just take a step back, be honest. He was kind of right about NATO, he was kind of right about immigration. He grew the economy quite well. Tax reform worked, he was right about some of China. I don't like how he said things about Mexico. But he wasn't wrong about these critical issues. That's why they're voting for him.""

Dimon added that ""people should be more respectful of our fellow citizens"" and suggested to the CNBC hosts that they not just ask people whether they're supporting Trump, but also why.

""Not like it is a binary thing, you're supporting Trump or you're not supporting Trump,"" he said. ""Why [are] you supporting Trump?""

Without being asked about MAGA specifically, Dimon ripped Democrats for their attack on Trump's supporters and said President Joe Biden's anti-MAGA obsession will hurt his reelection chances.

""The Democrats have done a pretty good job with the 'deplorables,' hugging on to their Bibles and their beers and their guns,"" Dimon said. ""I mean, really? Can we just stop that stuff and grow up and treat other people with respect and listen to them a little bit.

""I think this negative talk about MAGA is going to hurt Biden's election campaign.""

Dimon said he remains cautious on the U.S. economy over the next two years because of a combination of financial and geopolitical risks, CNBC reported.

""You have all these very powerful forces that are going to be affecting us in '24 and '25,"" Dimon said.

""Ukraine, the terrorist activity in Israel [and] the Red Sea, quantitative tightening, which I still question if we understand exactly how that works.""

Quantitative tightening refers to moves by the Federal Reserve to decrease the amount of liquidity or money supply in the economy."
Feb 02 2024,"The US economy added 353,000 jobs in January, starting off 2024 with a bang",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/02/economy/january-jobs-report-final/index.html,"New York CNN —

The US economy added a stunning 353,000 jobs last month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday, registering a stronger-than-expected gain to kick off 2024 and underscoring the resilience of the US economy in an election year.

The unemployment rate remained at 3.7% from the month before. It’s the 24th consecutive month that the nation’s jobless rate has been under 4%.

“The fact that the unemployment rate has been below 4% for 24 months straight for the first time since 1967 is truly remarkable,” Joe Brusuelas, chief economist and principal at RSM US, told CNN. “And that’s the word I keep saying as I look through this report: ‘This is remarkable.’ ‘Remarkable,’ is the takeaway here.”

More than a year ago, it seemed all but certain that the labor market would feel the effects of — and potentially be reeling from — the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate-hiking campaign. But 11 hikes and four pauses later, the US job market is registering one of the longest periods of expansion this century.

January’s job gains dashed market expectations for a Fed rate cut to come sooner than later, perhaps as early as March, and for the central bank to cut as many as six times in 2024. Investors’ probability for a March rate cut dropped from 38% to under 20% on Friday, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

However, the stronger-than-expected tally should help boost Americans’ tepid sentiments about the economy. And it shouldn’t knock the Fed off its current path, with officials having telegraphed a trio of rate cuts to occur this year, Brusuelas said.

“The Fed’s going to have to manage expectations very carefully here going forward,” he said. Powell signaled that the central bank wants to cut — and now “It’s just matter of not if, but when.”

An upside surprise

Hiring accelerated from December, which itself had far stronger employment growth than previously estimated. December’s job gains were revised higher by 117,000 positions to total 333,000 for the month. November was revised up as well, but only by 9,000 jobs, to a 182,000 net job gain.

January’s gains blew economists’ expectations out of the water: Consensus forecasts had called for a net gain of 176,500 jobs last month, according to FactSet.

Still, economists have cautioned that the January report is among the trickiest to forecast because it’s typically a big month for job losses (with seasonal workers being let go after the holidays and other businesses doing some new year’s belt-tightening). Additionally, the BLS applies new seasonal adjustment factors at the start of the year to help smooth out the data and better understand the trends.

For these reasons, some economists told CNN this week that it’s possible January would deliver an upside surprise.

They got one.

Where the job growth occurred

Most major industries — mining and logging excluded — added jobs in January, BLS data shows.

Private education and health services continued to drive job growth with 112,000 job gains. Health care and social assistance accounted for 100,400 of those, followed by professional and business services at 74,000 and retail trade at 45,200.

The leisure and hospitality industry added a mere 11,000 jobs in January but registered its 36th consecutive month of job gains, BLS data shows. As of January, this critical service industry that was bludgeoned at the outset of the pandemic is a mere 0.4% (75,000 jobs) from reaching its February 2020 employment levels.

During the recovery from the pandemic, leisure and hospitality and other services businesses have benefited from Americans’ strong desires to spend money on experiences.

150+ applicants for 30 jobs

In Minneapolis, Jillian Hiscock had little problem finding the more than two dozen workers she needed for her new sports bar.

Hiscock is about a month away from opening A Bar of Their Own, a bar and restaurant that exclusively will show women’s sporting events. The concept, which was inspired by industry trailblazer The Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, has garnered overwhelming support from the Twin Cities community since Hiscock floated the idea last spring and ran a crowdfunding campaign to get it off the ground.

The same was true for hiring efforts by A Bar of Their Own: She received 150 applications in two days’ time for 25 to 30 open positions.

“It’s a good problem to have, but I just wanted to make sure that we were being realistic about who we could actually communicate with, given our timeline,” she said. “But yeah, we had to turn it off in less than two days with over five times as many applicants as we needed for the positions we had available.”

The applicants came from all walks of life and included people who had experience in restaurants as well as folks who were out of work or looking to switch jobs or even careers.

“Since things have opened back up [following the pandemic], we’ve had a lot of folks whose relationships with work has fundamentally changed,” she said. “Showing up and just doing a thing for somebody that you feel doesn’t care about as a human is less interesting to people now, because we all know how quickly that can be taken away.”

People continue to want a better balance between their working life and personal life, she said.

“People were really excited about this, not just seeing this as another job, but seeing this as an opportunity to be a part of something bigger,” she said.

A banner year

The January jobs report also included the final figures for the BLS’ annual benchmark review of payroll data. US job growth last year was indeed weaker than initially estimated (by 266,000 jobs); however, that’s not as weak as the preliminary benchmark estimates suggested it could be.

Even with those revisions in play, 2023 was a banner year for job growth. Nearly 3.06 million jobs were added last year, seasonally adjusted data show. Outside of the record-shattering 2021 and 2022, that’s the highest annual jobs total since 1999 and the 17th largest on records that go back to 1939, BLS data show.

Also delivering a surprise were wage gains, which surged 0.6% for the month and 4.5% year-over-year.

“This elevates the risk that nominal wage growth will not fall back to levels consistent with reaching the inflation target on a sustained basis, particularly as the labor force participation rate refuses to rise any further,” Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings’ chief economist, wrote in a note issued Friday. “Wages growing at this rate, in a labor market this tight, is a problem for the Fed.”

Burying the recession expectations

The strong labor market has been the foundation for the surges in consumer spending — and robust economic growth — that the United States has seen in recent months. And while businesses have reined in hiring, people are quitting less and wage gains have seen some easing, the slowing pace of inflation means that people’s paychecks are finally able to go further than they have in years.

However, despite the strong economy, Americans have been mostly downbeat — although attitudes are on the upswing. A new CNN poll released Friday showed that 35% of Americans say things in the country today are going well. That’s an improvement from the 28% who felt positively about the state of affairs last fall.

The poll found that the sentiment is heavily influenced by partisanship, with the uptick being led by Democrats.

While the estimated 4.5% annual hourly earnings growth reported Friday may trigger a dull headache for the Fed, it’s ultimately good for the American psyche, Brusuelas said.

“This should put the last of the recession calls six feet under,” he said. “It’s about jobs, and it’s about what people make, and this data reflects the increase in productivity. Improved productivity leads to improved number of jobs, better pay and rising living standards. It’s that mythical tide that lifts all boats.”"
Jan 05 2024,"The US economy added 216,000 jobs in December",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/05/economy/jobs-report-december-final/index.html,"New York CNN —

Friday’s jobs report marked a fitting end to what was an odds-defying year.

The US economy added 216,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. The monthly total blew past expectations for a net gain of 160,000 jobs and capped off what’s been a year of resilience in the labor market.

Around this time last year, many experts said it was a sure bet that the Federal Reserve’s inflation-fighting rate-hiking campaign would result in job losses mounting and send the economy into a recession.

Instead, the labor market’s continued strength helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth during the past 12 months. The job market has indeed cooled down but did not derail despite 11 Fed hikes that brought the benchmark interest rate 5 percentage points higher in under two years’ time.

“We’ve lived through something quite unprecedented, which is such a large increase in interest rates and such a sharp drop in inflation without a meaningful increase in unemployment,” Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNN in an interview. “It’s never happened before.”

The Fed appears to be nailing the so-called “soft landing” of bringing inflation down without flinging the economy into a recession.

But the plane hasn’t landed just yet.

Friday’s jobs report also showed that the labor market and the broader economy remain at a turning point, with the ultimate destination likely hinging on interest rates coming down from 22-year highs, she said.

“We are seeing the labor market slow pretty substantially,” Pollak said, noting October and November were revised down by a combined 71,000 jobs. “The underlying rate of job growth is around 150,000/140,000, and that will continue to gradually slow in the coming months until the Fed takes its foot off the brake pedal.”

Fed Chair Jerome Powell has long cautioned that the labor market needs to cool from its breakneck pace and have a better alignment in the number of jobs available and the number of people hoping to take them. Last month, he acknowledged that the US jobs market had come into “better balance.”

Powell’s comments, and a batch of positive inflation data, helped fuel optimism from the markets that the Fed could start cutting rates sooner than later.

Friday’s robust jobs total and stronger-than-expected wage gains — 0.4% monthly and 4.1% annually — likely pushes that back, Andrew Patterson, Vanguard’s senior international economist, wrote Friday.

“Today’s report speaks to the bumpy road ahead for the Fed’s journey back to 2% inflation,” Patterson said, noting the central bank’s inflation target. “Strong headline job growth and wage growth above 4% combined with Fed communications, including the minutes, emphasizing the need to remain higher for longer decrease the likelihood of preemptive rate cuts.”

He added: “The decision of when to first cut policy rates remains one for the second half of the year, in our view.”

‘An extraordinary year’ for labor

Through 2023, the United States recorded a net gain of nearly 2.7 million jobs, according to seasonally adjusted data from the BLS. That averages out to a net gain of 225,000 per month.

That’s almost half of the 4.79 million jobs gained in 2022, which was the second-highest annual total on records going back to 1939. It’s also significantly under 2021’s record-setting year, when 7.27 million jobs were added as the nation continued to recover from the massive losses seen during Covid.

However, the 2.7 million jobs yearly total is more in line with what was seen during the economic expansion that occurred in the decade before the pandemic.

“The December [jobs report] resulted in a net increase of 216,000 in job creation, bringing to a close an extraordinary year in job creation,” Joe Brusuelas, RSM US principal and chief economist, wrote in a note issued Friday. “During the past year unemployment averaged 3.6% and closed the year at 3.7% in what the best year for labor since the 1950s.”

In January of last year, the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, hitting a level not seen since May 1969, two months before Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.

In April 2023, the unemployment rate for Black workers hit a record low of 4.7%.

And then in June, the labor force participation rate for women in their prime working age (25-54 years old) hit an all-time high of 77.8%.

Some warning signs

Last month’s gains were fueled by continued strong hiring in government (up 52,000 jobs), health care (+37,700), social assistance (+21,200 jobs), construction (+17,000 jobs) and leisure and hospitality (+12,000 jobs).

Those drivers of growth also serve as causes for concern.

During the past six months, 92% of all job gains were concentrated in three sectors: health care, government and leisure and hospitality, Pollak said. Spread across the whole year, that share was 76%, she added.

“Typically, job growth is more broad-based,” she said. “And so outside of those sectors, it’s looking pretty anemic in 2023.”

Labor turnover data released Wednesday showed a steep drop in hiring and quits, the latter providing a measurement of opportunity in the economy.

“Those are warning signs that perhaps we could be at risk of some overcooling in the coming months,” she said.

What could help counterbalance that is wage growth, she noted.

During the course of 2023, average hourly earnings slowed from a 4.8% annual growth rate in December 2022 to 4.1% last month, BLS data shows. As of November, annual inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) has cooled to 3.1% from 6.5% in December 2022, according to the BLS.

“In May [2023], real wage growth flipped positive, and that has been a good news story for workers who are really hurting after 25 straight months of negative real wage growth,” she said. “It’s good news for the economy going forward; it does somewhat reduce the risk of a recession early in the year, and it props up consumer spending, demand and revenues for businesses.”

Plus, she added, “productivity has been so high, it’s not necessarily inflationary.”"

TMJ4's Chief Political Reporter Charles Benson is covering the caucuses and looks at a key issue in 2024 election.

Dubuque is the oldest city in Iowa, known as the Masterpiece on the Mississippi because of its scenic views with a river that separates Iowa from Wisconsin and Illinois.

It’s also a good place see how the economy is working in this city of 60,000.

Angela Lee knows what it’s like to run a small business - she has seen inflation drive up costs at The Spot Nutrition juice bar and has adjusted.

""The cost of doing business has gone up a little bit - we’ve had to go up in prices,"" said Lee.

Lee and her husband are also raising two children - she feels they are in a good place right now.

""Business is going well - we had a really good year last year.""

Poll after poll point to the economy as a key issue in the 2024 election and it may play a role in who wins the Iowa caucuses Monday night.

The unemployment rate in Dubuque dropped last year - it’s now around 3% - that’s better than the national average of 3.7%.

Inflation and gas prices have come down but the cost of things are still expensive. Wages are up but so are interest rates.

Tut Fuller opened Capra Bank in his native hometown less than a year ago.

He’s seeing the impact of higher rates.

""Housing starts have been extremely slow, said Fuller. The mortgage industry is not doing a lot of mortgages right now and that’s not just in Dubuque, that’s all over.""

Dubuque has a healthy dose of manufacturing jobs and tourism is important to the local economy, but like many cities it needs more help with childcare needs.

Fuller sees an economy that has bounced back from the pandemic.

""Yeah, borrowing costs are up a little bit, but I don’t know, I think it’s pretty healthy and resilient.""

Dubuque County is more purple than red or blue in recent presidential elections. Barack Obama won here in 2008 and 2012. Donald Trump carried the county 2016 and 20.

Jan 25 2024,US economy grew faster than expected during the 4th quarter,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-fourth-quarter-2023,"The U.S. economy grew at a faster pace than expected at the end of 2023, underscoring its resilience even in the face of still-high inflation and steep interest rates.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew by 3.3% on an annualized basis in the three-month period from October through December, the Commerce Department said in its first reading of the data Thursday.

That is far higher than the 2% increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, although it marks a notable drop from the rapid 4.9% pace seen during the third quarter.

""GDP has four cylinders, and the fourth quarter fired on them all,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. ""Pundits are already saying this will be as good as it gets, but then again, most were predicting a recession last year that never came.""

WHEN WILL THE FEDERAL RESERVE START TO CUT INTEREST RATES?

Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, continued to power economic growth during the fourth quarter. It rose 2.8% for the period, down just slightly from the previous quarter.

Increases in private inventory investments, a boost in federal government spending and a jump in non-residential fixed income also helped to boost the GDP numbers. However, high mortgage rates continued to drain demand from the real estate market, with investment in housing plunging 27% for a second straight quarter.

THE INFLATION FIGHT FACES A 'DIFFICULT' LAST MILE

State and local government spending also helped to fuel the expansion, climbing 3.7% during the fourth quarter. Gross private domestic investment rose 2.1%, another contributor to growth.

""Once again, it’s the strength and resiliency of the consumer that carries the day for the U.S. economy,"" said Jim Baird, Plante Moran Financial Advisors CIO. ""Solid labor market conditions and wage growth coupled with the ability to tap cash and available credit continue to fuel spending.""

The economy has remained solid even as experts predicted that the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike campaign would send it spiraling into a recession. For all of 2023, the economy expanded 3.1%, up less than 1% in the previous year.

However, there are signs that growth is finally beginning to slow in the face of tighter monetary policy. Job growth is moderating. The housing market, which is vulnerable to higher interest rates, is trapped in a prolonged downturn, and consumer spending has shown signs of cooling off.

Many economists expect to see further cooling in coming months as higher interest rates continue to work their way through the economy.

""While there is no doubt the economy still has some winds in its sails, we believe cooler days are on the horizon,"" said Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist. ""Consumers will likely remain cautious with their spending as they confront ‘cost fatigue’ and less vibrant labor market conditions."""

(KNWA/KFTA) — Walther Manufacturing announced it is expanding its facility in Fort Smith.

The gun factory will use $30 million to add 40,000 square feet onto its existing 185,000-square-foot facility. The project is supposed to begin within the next few months, adding 76 jobs.

“Walther Manufacturing is making a substantial investment in our Fort Smith factory to facilitate the expansion of our research development and manufacturing of U.S.-produced firearms and accessories,” Tom Goike, Walther Manufacturing President and CEO said in a statement.

The increased number of jobs could provide economic impacts on the surrounding area.

“It’s always great when businesses bring in more work,” Robert Lopez, owner of Las Americas Restaurant, said. “Somebody else is growing, we grow, other businesses grow.

“People like to go out, try new cuisines, new stores, what’s new, so it works out for everybody.”

Mundi Ross, the director of marketing with Fort Chaffee Redevelopment Authority, said Walther Manufacturing’s facility expansion could have a variety of impacts.

“That equals tax dollars,” Ross said. “That equals an opportunity to go and enjoy our local cultural scene.”

Ross said she is excited about the future of the Fort Smith area and its potential growth. She described Fort Chaffee, Fort Smith and Barling as “one entity.”

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders met with Walther Manufacturing — which has had a presence in Arkansas since 2012 — during her European trade mission in the summer of 2023."

Jan 30 2024,The booming American economy leads the IMF to upgrade its outlook for the whole world this year,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2024/01/30/imf-world-economy-outlook-forecast-america-boom-soft-landing,"The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its outlook for the world economy this year, envisioning resilient growth led by the United States and a slower pace of inflation.

In its latest outlook, the 190-country lending agency said Tuesday that it now expects the global economy to grow 3.1% this year, unchanged from 2023 but better than the 2.9% it had predicted for 2024 in its previous estimate in October.

Worldwide, the IMF thinks inflation will ease from 6.8% in 2023 to 5.8% in 2024 and 4.4% in 2025. In the most advanced economies, the agency expects inflation to drop this year to 2.6% and next year to the 2% level that the Federal Reserve and some other central banks have set as a target.

The combination of steady growth and falling inflation has raised hopes for a so-called soft landing for the global economy – a slowdown sufficient to contain inflation without causing a recession.

“We are now in the final descent toward a soft landing,’’ Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the IMF’s chief economist, told reporters ahead of the report’s release.

The forecast for overall global growth this year and next (3.2%) trails the 3.8% average from 2000 to 2019. That is partly because the Fed and other central banks aggressively raised interest rates to fight high inflation, and the resulting higher borrowing costs have slowed spending and investment.

Gourinchas said he expects “relatively limited’’ economic damage from the attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea. The attacks have forced container ships carrying cargo between Asia and Europe to avoid the Suez Canal and instead take the long way around the tip of Africa, thereby delaying and disrupting shipments and raising freight charges. But Gourinchas said that for now, the Red Sea disruptions don’t seem to be “a major source of reigniting supply side inflation,” which arose from far more severe shipping backlogs in 2021 and 2022.

For the United States, the world’s largest economy, the IMF sharply marked up its estimate for growth this year – to 2.1% from the 1.5% it had penciled in three months ago. The U.S. economy expanded 2.5% in 2023 after an unexpected burst of year-end growth fueled by consumers willing to spend despite higher borrowing costs.

The outlook for the slumping Chinese economy was also upgraded by the IMF. It now expects the world’s second-biggest economy to grow 4.6% this year, up from the 4.2% it had forecast in October but down from 5.2% growth in 2023. Government spending has helped offset the damage from a collapse in the Chinese housing market.

“There was a lot of resilience in many, many parts of the world,’’ Gourinchas said, singling out Brazil, India, Southeast Asia and Russia, which has remained surprisingly sturdy in the face of Western sanctions imposed after its invasion of Ukraine.

But the IMF downgraded the outlook for some places. Europe, for example, continues to struggle with dispirited consumers and the lingering effects of the energy price shock caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The IMF expects the 20 countries that share the euro currency to collectively grow a meager 0.9% this year. That would be up from 0.5% growth in 2023 but down from the IMF’s October forecast of 1.2% growth for the eurozone this year.

The IMF also modestly downgraded the outlook for the Japanese economy, to 0.9%, a drop from 1.9% growth in 2023.

The improving inflation outlook is a result of higher interest rates, the end of the supply chain backlogs of the past couple of years, more workers entering the job market and lower energy prices after the spike caused by the Ukraine war. The IMF expects oil prices, which plunged 16% in 2023, to fall a further 2.3% this year and 4.8% in 2025.

The world economy still faces risks. One is that financial markets have become too confident that the Fed will reverse course and start cutting rates as early as its meeting in March. Gourinchas said he doesn’t expect the rate-cutting to start until the second half of 2024. Disappointed investors could drive down stock prices if they don’t see lower rates as soon as they hoped.

Another is that geopolitical tensions, especially between the United States and China, could disrupt world trade. Gourinchas suggested that some of President Joe Biden’s economic policies, including those that benefit American producers of computer chips and green technology, could violate World Trade Organization rules.

The IMF expects world trade to grow just 3.3% this year and 3.6% in 2025, below the historical average of 4.9%."
Jan 23 2024,It’s primary time in New Hampshire. Here’s a snapshot of the Granite State’s economy,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2024/01/23/business/new-hampshire-economy-primary/index.html,"New York CNN —

New Hampshire, the “first-in-the-nation” primary state (which will hold those elections Tuesday), has been a relatively “better-off” state than most others nationally.

Unemployment is low, economic growth is strong, but that doesn’t mean life in the Granite State is without its bumps.

Here’s a snapshot of New Hampshire’s economy in advance of Tuesday’s election.

Strong job market

New Hampshire has a diverse mix of industries, similar to that of the United States overall, but with hubs in fields such as health care, education and manufacturing.

And while it’s a state with one of the highest interstate commuting rates in the nation (thanks to its proximity to other metro areas, specifically Boston), New Hampshire boasts one of the lowest unemployment rates, logging a preliminary jobless rate of 2.3% in November, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

“It’s sort of a ‘good news/bad news situation,’” said Charlie Dougherty, a Wells Fargo senior economist who follows the Northeast US region closely. “The good news is, it represents a strong labor market, where a lot of folks have employment, and for those who find themselves displaced, it’s relatively easy to find another job.”

The bad news?

“The challenge is for businesses who are trying to hire,” he said.

Tough for employers to find workers

Worker shortages have been a key theme of the pandemic recovery across the nation as economic growth outstripped businesses’ abilities to hire enough employees. Several factors contributed to the tight labor market, including early retirements, Covid-related deaths and long-term health issues, caregiving needs, health and safety concerns, and a greater desire for work-life balance. However, the situation has been more acute in New Hampshire.

“New Hampshire is going to run into some headwinds, when it comes to slower population growth,” Dougherty said. “New Hampshire skews a little bit older, and as more people age out of the labor force, it’s going to present some challenges to overall growth in the state over the long run.”

As of November, there were 2.1 jobs for every person looking for one in New Hampshire, according to BLS Job Openings and Labor Turnover state-specific data released last week. Nationally, that ratio is 1.4.

Both rates are trending down toward their pre-pandemic levels; however, New Hampshire still has a ways to go. Tight labor markets are seen as problematic in the context of inflation: The Federal Reserve views out-of-balance labor markets as potential drivers of higher wages that, in turn, can lead to higher prices and keep inflation elevated.

Additionally, while the state’s lack of income tax or sales tax means it is attractive for businesses and workers, New Hampshire is running up against a housing crisis.

“You’ve got to get the people here; but even if you get the people, where are they going to live?” Patricia M. Anderson, a professor of economics at Dartmouth University, told CNN in an interview.

Housing becoming increasingly unaffordable

Housing affordability has eroded in New Hampshire in recent years. Rising home prices coupled with higher mortgage rates put homebuying out of reach for many residents.

“This is a trend that you’ve seen especially in the Northeast, where the housing supply’s a little more limited, and that exerts upward pressure on prices,” Dougherty said.

In the quaint town of Chester, New Hampshire, located about 20 minutes outside of Manchester, home prices have jumped in the past year, said Patrick Connelly, whose family has run Field to Fork Farm, an organic farm and now event venue, for almost two decades.

“People can’t find rentals; there are certainly people that want to live in our town, and there are hundreds of houses backlogged to be built until things loosen up,” Connelly said, referencing the high interest rate environment. “So there’s a lot of growth in our area, in our small little town, but that’s not going to help the big issue of affordable housing, because the houses they’re building are all $700,000-$900,000 homes where the builders make the most money.”

Counterbalancing the limited income tax and lack of sales tax collections, property taxes in New Hampshire are the third-highest nationwide, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation.

The state has allocated $100 million in federal Covid-19 recovery funds to build more affordable housing and help boost the workforce.

Tourism

New Hampshire’s important tourism industry has recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic in terms of visitors and revenue.

People wanted a place to go after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, said Brian Gottlob, the state’s economist.

“When the pandemic receded, that pent-up desire got spent,” he said. “A good part of it [was] because New Hampshire does a really, really good job of creating an image and marketing.”

In 2021, when air travel was still down, the state’s tourism division increased its digital marketing campaigns in areas within driving distance, such as Ohio and Washington, DC, said Lori Harnois, New Hampshire’s tourism director. It is now marketing more heavily in Canada and larger portions of New York and Pennsylvania.

Some 4.5 million visitors spent $2.3 billion in New Hampshire last summer. Both metrics are up 3.3% from the summer of 2022, she said. Part of the increase in spending is due to inflation.

However, the industry remains about 800 to 1,000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic staffing levels as the state struggles with labor shortages, Gottlob said. Tourism, which encompasses leisure and hospitality, is New Hampshire’s second-largest employer, behind retail.

Median income/poverty

The typical New Hampshire household has a higher income compared to the average in the United States, and a smaller share of state’s residents are in poverty.

The median household income in New Hampshire was just under $90,000 in 2022, compared to just under $75,000 for the US, according to the Census Bureau.

And the Granite State has the lowest official poverty rate of any state, at 7.2% for 2022, while the nation’s rate is 12.6%, according to the bureau’s American Community Survey.

Southeastern New Hampshire — where three-quarters of the state’s residents live — benefits from being close to the Boston metropolitan area, said Phil Sletten, research director at the left-leaning New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. That region has the highest median incomes and lowest poverty rates in the Granite State.

But other parts of New Hampshire — particularly the northernmost and west-central areas, which are rural — are struggling more in comparison. Their poverty rates were 11.6% and 11.7%, respectively, during the 2018 to 2022 time frame, compared to 7.3% for the state over that time period, according to Sletten.

Also, Sletten noted, it’s important to consider that New Hampshire is a relatively expensive state to live in.

“If you look at the top-level numbers, it is a better-off state in terms of its economic fortunes than many other states,” he said. But “when we compare incomes across states, unless you’re adjusting for the cost of living, that may not indicate the overall economic well-being or financial security of households.”

Rosier sentiment and outlook

New Hampshire residents give President Joe Biden somewhat higher marks on his handling of the economy compared to what other surveys have found for the nation at large. Some 42% of New Hampshire residents approved of Biden on the economy, with 55% disapproving, according to a November CNN/University of New Hampshire poll.

New Hampshire’s economy expanded at a 4.5% rate during the third quarter of last year, according to Commerce Department data. That robust rate was close to the national average of 4.9%.

But when it comes to their personal finances, New Hampshire residents are downbeat. Some 46% think their household is worse off financially than a year ago, while only 15% say they are better off, and 39% feel their finances are about the same, according to a December poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.

One bright note: In 2022, some 61% of Granite Staters felt their household was worse off — but the current share is still “considerably higher” than it was in 2021, the center said.

Residents’ sentiments vary widely by party. The share of Republicans who say they are worse off is near an all-time high, while the shares of Democrats and Independents who feel this way have “fallen considerably” over the past year, according to the center.

“I think my friends and the people I associate with are pretty emboldened in who they’re going to be voting for, and I think the economy wouldn’t really affect it that much,” Connelly said. “I think that’s pretty common in New Hampshire. The people are really in their camps, and they’re not moving.”"
Feb 02 2024,"US job growth unexpectedly jumps in January as economy adds 353,000 new positions",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-january-2024,"U.S. job growth unexpectedly surged in January, underscoring the resilience of the labor market even in the face of high interest rates and stubborn inflation.

Employers added 353,000 jobs in January , the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, easily topping the 180,000 gain forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%, against expectations for a slight increase.

Wage growth also accelerated last month, with average hourly earnings — a key measure of inflation — rising 0.6%, double what economists had expected. On an annual basis, wages rose 4.5% in January. However, that coincided with a drop in average hours worked, which fell by 0.2 hour last month to 34.1 hours.

THE NUMBER OF HIGH-PAYING JOBS IS DWINDLING

In another show of strength for the economy, the report contained sizable upward revisions to job growth during the previous two months. Gains for November and December were revised up by a total of 126,000 jobs to a respective 182,000 and 333,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is stronger than it previously appeared.

The surprisingly strong report paints a picture of a job market that has gone largely unscathed despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest-rate hike campaign, but it also diminishes the odds of an imminent rate cut.

""The dramatic upside surprise to both jobs and wage growth means that a March rate cut must be off the table now, and a May cut is also now potentially on ice,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. ""Certainly, with this kind of number, the six or seven rate cuts that markets had been pricing in seems very offside.""

AMERICANS IN THESE STATES ARE GETTING A PAY RAISE THIS YEAR

The Federal Reserve signaled it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally softening after months of solid job gains as policymakers try to ensure that inflation continues to ease. The consumer price index has cooled considerably in recent months but remains above the Fed's preferred 2% target, despite 11 rate hikes in the span of 16 months.

Faster job growth and the unexpected uptick in wage gains complicate the U.S. central bank's plans to start unwinding tighter monetary policy. Policymakers held interest rates steady at the conclusion of their two-day meeting on Wednesday and signaled that they are prepared to cut interest rates later this year.

""If the economy evolves broadly as expected, it will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year,"" Chair Jerome Powell told reporters during a post-meeting press conference in Washington, D.C. ""But the economy has surprised forecasters in many ways since the pandemic, and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not assured.""

Stock futures fell after the report dashed investors' hopes for a March rate reduction, and called into doubt the prospect of a May cut. Just 17% of investors are currently pricing in a quarter-point cut in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

Job gains were broad-based last month, with the biggest gains in professional and business services (74,000), health care (70,000), retail trade (45,200), government (36,000) and manufacturing (23,000).

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown.

""So much for the cooling labor market,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union. ""The best part of the blockbuster number is how widespread the hiring has become. ... This shows a growing labor market reflecting a broad-based economic expansion, and not just recoveries in a few sectors such as health care and government."""
Dec 28 2023,It’s okay to be optimistic about the economy next year,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/24008366/economy-predictions-2024-recession-inflation-growth-jobs,"I’m going to throw out a wild idea here: What if the economy is good in 2024? I know, I know, prices are still too high. Everybody hates everything so much that we’ve coined the term “vibecession.” The pandemic fallout is still reverberating. But hear me out — maybe it would be neat to head into the new year without all the doom and gloom.

There is a case for hope here. I mean, look at what happened in 2023. We came into the year with the lowest of expectations. Tons of economists, including some big names, thought a major downturn was inevitable in the United States. Many people were sure the Federal Reserve’s fight to get inflation down would mean a significant spike in unemployment; the logic was preordained. In fall 2022, Bloomberg ran a headline forecasting a 100 percent chance of a recession within a year.

As it turns out, there’s never a 100 percent chance of anything. That surefire 2023 recession never came. Despite the negative sentiment around the economy — sentiment that mayyybe is starting to turn around — things this year were really good. Inflation came down. The jobs market stayed strong. Consumers, in aggregate, kept spending. The US economy grew at a surprisingly strong rate. After a tough 2022, stock market investors had a solid time.

“2023 wasn’t supposed to happen,” said Claudia Sahm, the founder of Sahm Consulting and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. “For inflation to come down that much, unemployment’s been below 4 percent for the longest stretch since the 1960s, and growth — inflation-adjusted consumer spending is just knocking it out of the park.”

There definitely are worse ways to head into 2024.

Come over here, let me tell you a nice little story about next year

The US economy is not out of the woods. We haven’t yet reached that coveted “soft landing,” where inflation gets back to the Fed’s 2 percent target without tipping the economy into recession. That outcome does seem possible — I’m not saying it’s going to happen, but there’s some room for optimism.

The stock market is feeling really excited about the year ahead — arguably, maybe a little too excited

Predictions obviously can be wrong — again, see 2023 — but many economists feel quite positive looking ahead. Goldman Sachs sees just 15 percent odds of a recession over the next 12 months and thinks the economy is on its “final descent” to a soft landing. Bank of America is making a similar call. The Fed likes what it’s seeing and is hoping for more of it in 2024. It’s anticipating three interest rate cuts next year.

“It should be a good year. Probably not as good as 2023,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. (Seriously, by most traditional economic measures, the 2023 economy was very good.) He pointed out that he wasn’t among the group expecting a recession this past year — when you’re on the right side of a bet, you may as well enjoy it — but that even he wasn’t anticipating this. “The big surprise was the supply side of the economy. Productivity growth revived and labor force growth surged, so that allowed the economy to grow a lot more and still get inflation back in the bottle.”

Inflation is on track to continue to cool. That doesn’t mean prices will go back to where they were in 2019, though they may decline in some areas. If the labor market stays robust, wages should keep rising, too, and at a pace faster than inflation.

“Wage growth for all income groups is stronger than the rate of inflation, so people’s real purchasing power should improve. They should feel a lot better about the buying power of their income a year from now than they do today,” Zandi said. The relief will be most welcome for low-income households, he added, which are under the most pressure right now.

Even though the Fed hasn’t cut interest rates yet, they’ve started to fall in some areas in anticipation of what’s ahead. Mortgage rates are back under 7 percent, which has inspired some hopefulness around the housing market. The stock market is feeling excited about the year ahead — arguably, maybe a little too excited.

After the Fed’s latest interest rate decision and Fed Chair Jay Powell’s news conference, “markets got a little giddy,” Sahm said. In the subsequent days, some Fed members tried to temper some of that giddiness, to limited effect, as investors remain pretty amped.

This nice little story has to come with some buts

Nothing is guaranteed in life, and certainly not a good economy. Even if the US avoids recession in 2024, someday, there will almost certainly be a recession. It’s just the way the business cycle goes. There are plenty of risks that could put a recession on next year’s agenda.

Some economists still think a downturn is likelier than not. Andrew Patterson, senior international economist at Vanguard, has a base case that the US and other developed markets will see mild recessions likely in 2024. Even if the US economy doesn’t turn completely negative, he anticipates some job loss. “Fed policy [needs to] bring inflation fully back down to 2 percent, and we believe that is going to require some labor market loosening,” he said. “That’s going to come with some pain.”

Larry Summers, former treasury secretary and one of the pre-2023 doomsayers, told the Financial Times that it’s “premature” to call this a soft landing, given where inflation is. “We may soft land on the aircraft carrier, but the landing may be hard, and we may overfly,” he said.

The main risk for 2024 is the Fed. It might keep interest rates too high for too long, pushing the economy under, or it could cut them too early, allowing inflation to take off again and necessitating even harsher hikes later. It could confuse markets with its decisions. “They’re threading a difficult needle,” Zandi said. “I think the odds of a mistake are certainly receding, but we’re not across the finish line.”

“Definitely by this time next year, we’re either landed, or we’re in a recession”

There could be dangers lurking elsewhere that observers don’t see yet, such as an issue in the banking system. Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse earlier this year, which was related to the Fed’s interest rate hikes, felt like it came out of nowhere, even though it didn’t. If the past few years have taught us anything, the economy can also take big hits from really uncontrollable forces, like the pandemic and Russia’s Ukraine war. A sudden change in oil prices is always a possible risk, too. “Nothing does more damage to the economy than higher oil prices very quickly,” Zandi said.

There is also the fact that inflation coming back down without a recession would be a unique scenario. For inflation to come down fully to 2 percent while maintaining a strong labor market and avoiding broader macroeconomic weakness would be quite unprecedented, Patterson said. “It’s not out of the realm of possibility,” he added. “It’s not our base case by any means. But it is also something that we’re keeping an eye on.”

Honestly, maybe we just kind of need a hopeful nice story sometimes

The US economy is far from perfect. Increases in the cost of living are painful, and even before this latest bout of inflation, things were far from great. Higher interest rates to fight inflation have made things worse. There’s no denying that people say they do not feel good about the state of affairs, macroeconomically speaking, even if their spending says otherwise, and many admit that, personally, they’re doing okay. We’re in a weird and far-from-ideal economic scenario.

Still, it might be nice to at least try to be modestly optimistic. If objectively good things keep happening for long enough, maybe people will start to feel it more, too.

In 2023, we sort of turned a corner on inflation. Turning that corner took too long, but it happened, nonetheless. “I understand why people are angry. I’m just happy that more people have paychecks, the paychecks are bigger, and they’re out there spending,” Sahm said. She thinks that by the middle of next year, we should know whether we’ve gotten a soft landing or not. “Definitely by this time next year, we’re either landed, or we’re in a recession,” she said. Let’s all aim for the former."
Jan 26 2024,The U.S. economy grew at blistering 3.3% pace in Q4 while inflation pulled back,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/gdp-q4-2023-the-us-economy-grew-at-a-3point3percent-pace-in-the-fourth-quarter.html,"That compared with the Wall Street consensus estimate for a gain of 2% in the final three months of the year. The third quarter grew at a 4.9% pace.

Gross domestic product , a measure of all the goods and services produced, increased at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to data adjusted seasonally and for inflation.

The economy grew at a much more rapid pace than expected while inflation eased in the final three months of 2023, as the U.S. easily skirted a recession that many forecasters had thought was inevitable, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

In addition to the better than expected GDP move, there also was some progress on inflation.

Core prices for personal consumption expenditures, which the Federal Reserve prefers as a longer-term inflation measure, rose 2% for the period, while the headline rate was 1.7%.

On an annual basis, the PCE price index rose 2.7%, down from 5.9% a year ago, while the core figure excluding food and energy posted a 3.2% increase annually, compared with 5.1%.

The two components together added up to ""supersonic Goldilocks, because it's really a strong number yet inflation hasn't shown up,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at U.S. Bank. ""Everybody wanted to have fun. People bought new cars, a lot of recreation spending as well as taking trips. We've been expecting a soft landing for some time. This is just one step in that direction.""

The U.S. economy for all of 2023 accelerated at a 2.5% annualized pace, well ahead of the Wall Street outlook at the beginning of the year for few if any gains and better than the 1.9% increase in 2022.

As had been the case through the year, a strong pace of consumer spending helped drive the expansion. Personal consumption expenditures increased 2.8% for the quarter, down just slightly from the previous period.

State and local government spending also contributed, up 3.7%, as did a 2.5% increase in federal government expenditures. Gross private domestic investment rose 2.1%, another significant factor for the robust quarter.

The chain-weighted price index, which accounts for prices as well as changes in consumer behavior, increased 1.5% for the quarter, down sharply from 3.3% in the previous period and below the Wall Street estimate for a 2.5% acceleration.

""This year has been like Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots, and the economy is knocking the blocks off the economists, always outperforming,"" said Dan North, senior economist with Allianz Trade Americas. Fed Chair Jerome Powell ""has got to have a smirk on his face this morning. Again, he's defying the economists' predictions with strong growth and inflation clearly coming under control.""

Markets showed only a modest reaction to the report. Stock futures gained slightly while Treasury yields moved lower. Futures markets continued to reflect the likelihood that the Fed will enact its first rate cut in May, though the CME Group's FedWatch gauge put the odds of a March cut at 47.4% around 10 a.m. ET.

""It was a great report, but you didn't see the market move much because GDP is backward-looking. It told us what happened in October and November and December,"" North said. ""It's great for historical patterns, but it doesn't really tell us much about where we're headed.""

In other economic news Thursday, initial jobless claims totaled 214,000, an increase of 25,000 from the previous week and ahead of the estimate for 199,000, according to the Labor Department. Continuing claims rose to 1.833 million, an increase of 27,000.

The GDP report wraps up a year in which most economists were almost certain the U.S. would enter at least a shallow recession. Even the Fed had predicted a mild contraction due to banking industry stress last March.

However, a resilient consumer and a powerful labor market helped propel the economy through the year, which also featured an ongoing pullback in manufacturing and a Fed that kept raising interest rates in its battle to bring down inflation.

As the calendar turns a page to a new year, hopes have shifted away from a recession as markets anticipate the Fed will start cutting rates while inflation continues to drift back to its 2% goal.

Concerns remain, however, that the economy faces more challenges ahead.

Some of the worries center around the lagged effects of monetary policy, specifically the 11 interest rate hikes totaling 5.25 percentage points that the Fed approved between March 2022 and July 2023. Conventional economic wisdom is that it can take as long as two years for such policy tightening to make its way through the system, so that could contribute to slowness ahead.

Other angst centers around how long consumers can keep spending as savings dwindle and high-interest debt loads accrue. Finally, there's the nature of what is driving the boom beyond the consumer: Government deficit spending has been a significant contributor to growth, with the total federal IOU at $34 trillion and counting. The budget deficit has totaled more than half a trillion dollars for the first three months of fiscal 2024.

There also are political worries as the U.S. enters the heart of the presidential election campaign, and geopolitical fears with violence in the Middle East and the continuing bloody Ukraine war.

Correction: The price index for personal consumption expenditures rose 2.7% on an annual basis, down from 5.9% a year ago. An earlier version mischaracterized the figures.

Feb 06 2024,"Pennsylvania Gov. Shapiro proposes $48 billion budget with focus on education, economy, and people – Pennsylvania Capital-Star",Pennsylvania Capital-Star,right,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pennsylvania-gov-shapiro-proposes-48-billion-budget-with-focus-on-education-economy-and-people,"Gov. Josh Shapiro said he wants to invest in the people of Pennsylvania with a $48.3 billion budget that directs new funding to education, economic growth, and creating better opportunities for residents.

“We need to build a more competitive Pennsylvania that starts in our classrooms, runs through our union halls and small businesses, through our farmlands and our high rises, our college campuses, and leads to a life of opportunity and a retirement with dignity,” Shapiro said during his budget address Tuesday in the state Capitol rotunda – the first time a governor has given an address there in the building’s nearly 120-year history.

Shapiro spoke about the successes of his first year in office, which ended with an upgrade in Pennsylvania’s bond rating and a $14 billion surplus. In his second year, Shapiro said he believes it is time to invest some of the surplus “squirreled away in Harrisburg.”

“Look, it is not a badge of honor, nor is it something to be politically proud of for some lawmakers out there to say: I took more money from the good people of Pennsylvania than I needed and then bragged about how I just kept it in some bank account here in the Capitol,” Shapiro said, in a rebuke to lawmakers who argue the commonwealth should safeguard its reserves.

Shapiro noted that even if every one of the proposals in his budget passes, the state would still have an $11 billion surplus at the end of June 2025.

The spending proposal includes a response to the state court ruling last year that Pennsylvania’s K-12 education funding system is unconstitutional by providing more than $1 billion in new funding for public schools.

Shapiro’s budget builds on a 2022 campaign pledge to provide career pathways for young adults with a plan to overhaul the commonwealth’s public university and community college system, with a 15% increase in funding for state-owned universities and a 5% increase for the state’s four land grant universities.

It proposes more than $500 million in investments in the state’s first economic development strategy in more than 20 years while continuing a phased reduction in corporate income taxes, speeding state permitting to “work at the speed of business,” and redirecting more than $283 million in state sales tax to avoid public transit fare hikes and service cuts.

Republican leaders responded with criticism that the plan is unrealistic and does little to improve the state’s economic prospects.

“Today, we heard not a moderate Gov. Shapiro,” Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) said after Shapiro’s address. “But obviously a very liberal-minded Gov. Shapiro.”

Ward expressed concern that Shapiro’s plan didn’t address state regulations that she said caused Pennsylvania to lose business, jobs and population to other states. Ward also called the plan a “budget of unicorns and rainbows.”

“We will dig into this budget, we will look at it hard, we will try to find out where he’s coming up with the money to pay for this,” Ward said. “In addition to just raiding the rainy day fund, where is this money coming from?”

‘The future of the commonwealth’

House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) said she is confident that much of Shapiro’s proposal would become a reality as lawmakers and stakeholders negotiate in the coming months.

“No longer will we wait to invest in the future of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, because the future starts right now, today,” McClinton said.

House Appropriations Committee Chairperson Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said Pennsylvania can’t afford another year without raising the minimum wage, without fixing toxic and crumbling schools, or without making college affordable.

“You’re going to hear people talk about how much this costs. But look, the cost is too great for us not to do it,” Harris said, adding “ … We can’t afford another year of disinvestment in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

But House Minority Leader Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster) described the budget as a “phishing scam” that claims to offer a fix for education and mass transit while keeping taxes low and making Pennsylvania more competitive.

“With a proposal like this, I can see why at first blush that many Pennsylvanians would want to buy in,” Cutler said, adding, “ … just because it looks good, you shouldn’t click the link because it could lead to ruin.”

In his address, Shapiro prodded lawmakers to move this year on initiatives that have languished in the Pennsylvania Legislature as neighboring states have acted decisively.

Shapiro called on lawmakers to raise Pennsylvania’s minimum wage from $7.25, where it has been since 2009, to $15 an hour to keep pace with each of its neighbors.

“We are falling behind, it’s anticompetitive, and it’s hurting our workers,” Shapiro said. “We have seen proof that Pennsylvania workers living in border counties would rather drive into another state for work so they can earn a higher wage than take a job at home in Pennsylvania.”

The governor’s budget calls for tapping a new revenue source by legalizing and taxing the recreational use of cannabis by adults, which all of Pennsylvania’s neighbors — save West Virginia — have already done. Administration officials said revenue from legal marijuana is projected to reach $250 million annually in five years.

Shapiro said that in addition to ensuring that the new industry is regulated and taxed, legislation should create jobs and build wealth in the communities that have been disproportionately impacted by criminalization of marijuana. It should also provide for the expungement of criminal records for people convicted of nonviolent possession of small amounts of marijuana, he said.

Not mentioned in Shapiro’s address but included in the budget is a plan to regulate and tax slot machine-like skill games, which have proliferated in a legal gray area outside the authority of the state’s Gaming Control Board. Administration officials estimate it would generate $150.4 million in the first year.

“While I expect you will carefully analyze my proposals and seek your own in the final budget, your analysis shouldn’t be used as an excuse for paralysis,” Shapiro said. “It’s time to solve these pressing problems, to meet this moment responsibly and with bipartisan compromise.”

Education funding

The February 2023 Commonwealth Court decision declaring Pennsylvania’s education funding system unconstitutional provided the overarching narrative for much of Shapiro’s first year in office.

By choosing to forego an appeal in the state Supreme Court, legislative leaders accepted the court’s mandate to change the system, Shapiro said Tuesday. He called on lawmakers to build on the commitment to students and teachers they have already shown by approving money for building repairs, in-school mental health services and free school breakfast.

Shapiro’s proposal would adopt the recommendation of the bipartisan Basic Education Funding Commission to bring each of Pennsylvania’s school districts up to an adequate funding level based on the expenditures of its most successful districts.

It would provide $872 million in the first installment to close the $5.4 billion gap over the next seven years. In addition, school districts would receive an additional $200 million in basic education funding through the state’s fair funding formula and reset the base amount each school district receives at 2023-24 levels so that no district sees a cut.

The proposal also follows the commission’s recommendation to spend $300 million a year over the next five years to repair school buildings.

Shapiro called on lawmakers to update what he called an antiquated charter school law that forces school districts to overpay for charter school tuition. He noted that when Pennsylvania first allowed charter schools in 1997, online charter schools were almost unheard of. Today, nearly 60,000 students attend cyber charter schools..

The charter school law provides the same funding to online charter schools as it does to brick-and-mortar charters. That amount varies widely from one school district to another. By setting a statewide charter school tuition at $8,000, school districts would save $262 million a year, Shapiro said.

“If you combine those savings with the new money I’m proposing for 500 school districts, that would mean nearly $2 billion more for public schools next year,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro said it’s also incumbent upon the state to make sure students have the freedom to chart their own course and determine their next steps after graduating from school.

“If you’re in the 10th or 11th grade and you’re excited about being a welder or a plumber, we should celebrate that and we should treat that career path with the same level of respect to someone who chooses to go to college,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro said his budget would build on record investments in vocational and technical schools and trade apprenticeships by establishing a program to connect young workers with skills to thousands of employers who need them.

And for those who choose college, Shapiro said his budget would improve access by capping state university and community college tuition at $1,000 per semester and increase state grants for private university students to nearly $7,000 a year.

In his first budget address last year, Shapiro said Pennsylvania’s higher education system was broken. On Tuesday, he outlined a plan to unite the 10 state-owned universities with the state’s 15 community colleges while preserving local leadership. The budget would provide $975 million in new funding for the combined public university and college system.

“Together our public colleges and universities will create pathways to affordable credentials and degrees while opening up the doors of opportunity and meeting the Commonwealth’s workforce needs,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro’s proposal would also change the way Pennsylvania’s state-related universities – the University of Pittsburgh, and Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities – are funded to make state appropriations performance-based rather than writing a blank check.

‘…sick and tired of losing to friggin Ohio’

While Shapiro touted his administration’s wins in attracting new industry and its work to improve the business environment, he said Pennsylvania is still outspent by neighbors in its economic development efforts.

“Let’s be frank. Their investment is paying off and I am sick and tired of losing to friggin Ohio. We need to catch up right now,” Shapiro said.

At the core of Shapiro’s economic development strategy is a $500 million bond issue to make industrial sites ready for business by obtaining permits and installing utilities.

Economic growth should not be solely focused on city high rises and suburban office parks, Shapiro said, noting that 600,000 Pennsylvania residents work in agriculture on 53,000 farms that contribute $132 billion to the state’s economy.

“To ignore that is not only disrespectful to our farmers, it doesn’t make sense economically. In the same sentence when we talk about life sciences, manufacturing, robotics, we should be talking about investing in our farms and in our farmers,” Shapiro said.

To that end, the proposed budget includes investments to help farmers upgrade their equipment and to promote animal health and disease prevention by funding a new state animal testing laboratory in western Pennsylvania.

Speaking about human services, Shapiro told the story of a 60-year-old single mother who cares for her adult son who requires 24/7 care. Although funding has been available for in-home care, many families who need such services have been unable to obtain them because too few people are willing to do the job for the wages offered by the state.

“I’ve listened to those families. I’ve seen the exhaustion and the desperation in the eyes of parents and caregivers who are doing everything right. But they still can’t get their kids the services they need. It’s heartbreaking,” Shapiro said.

Shapiro’s budget would provide $216 million that would allow the state to draw down another $266 million in federal money to allow community based service providers to pay higher wages to in-home care providers.

In another anecdote,Shapiro recalled Nicolas Elizalde, a 14-year-old student killed in an ambush shooting after a football game at Roxborough High School in Philadelphia. His mother Meredith, who was in the audience Tuesday, has been a vocal advocate for gun safety laws, Shapiro said.

“With gun violence at unacceptable levels in our communities, it is long past time for us to take real action,” Shapiro said.

His budget proposal includes $75 million in new funding for gun violence intervention, prevention, investigation, and prosecution. It would also provide $30 million in school- and community-based gun prevention, security for nonprofit institutions such as synagogues and churches, and create the Office of Gun Violence within the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency.

But Shapiro called on lawmakers to do more, noting that many “talk a big game on law and order,” yet allow loopholes in background check requirements to go unclosed.

In closing, Shapiro pointed to the lavish murals that adorn the walls of the Capitol rotunda, saying that their images of Pennsylvania history give him hope for the commonwealth.

“When I walk these halls, and I see these depictions of our past, I can’t help but feel optimistic about our future, a future we will build together staying true to the words and the creed of William Penn as we work to do what is truly wise and just.”

Jan 12 2024,Biden touts the economy in return trip to Lehigh Valley with big election ahead,Lehigh Valley Live,left,https://lehighvalleylive.com/lehigh-county/2024/01/biden-touts-the-economy-in-return-trip-to-lehigh-valley-with-big-election-ahead-photos.html,"In his second trip to the political battleground region since taking office, President Joe Biden visited the Lehigh Valley on Friday afternoon to tour a handful of small businesses and tout a message of an American economy on an upswing as he vies for a second term.

The Democrat stopped in three stores along Main Street in Emmaus, greeting business owners, employees, and residents — many cheering, some jeering — and later appeared at the new fire training academy in Allentown that was built using federal stimulus funds.

Biden, who was born and spent his early years ago 80 miles away in Scranton, told reporters the goal of his visit was to “make sure what we’re doing” on the economy — what his administration calls “Bidenomics” — is “making some sense” and “affecting people’s attitudes.”

“Starting a new business is an act of hope,” Biden said at the Allentown Fire Training Academy. “And a lot of people came out of the last several years kind of down.”

“I just came away from this really reassured that what we’ve done has had an impact. Not just here in Pennsylvania but throughout the country.”

The economy is a topic of close scrutiny for Biden. Opponents frequently attack him for his handling of it, and polls show many Americans are dissatisfied. Supporters say he doesn’t get enough credit as unemployment and inflation numbers have improved in recent months.

The White House also stressed Friday a record 16 million new business applications have been filed in the U.S. over the last three years.

Biden last visited the Valley when he appeared at the Mack Trucks plant in Lower Macungie in July 2021 to promote manufacturing.

His return Friday comes as Pennsylvania, a swing state, could play a big role in November’s election, and the Valley in particular is a critical area. Biden defeated Trump in the state in 2020, winning 53% of the Valley’s vote.

Polls so far show Biden and Trump close in a potential 2024 rematch, including in Pennsylvania. A Jan. 10 Quinnipiac University survey found the state is a dead heat between them.

Among the stores Biden visited in Emmaus was Nowhere Coffee Company, which began in 2021 with the help of federal small business loans and now has two locations in the area.

“Anybody want a coffee? It’s on me,” Biden said, according to the press pool report.

The president ordered a smoothie for himself and took selfies and chatted while he waited for the drink. He paid cash for it.

“By the way, we’re almost in heaven,” Biden said as he left the store. “We’re almost in Scranton.”

Before that, Biden stopped at South Mountain Cycle, a bike shop in the same building. It’s owned by Borough Councilman Chad Balliet and wife Heather Balliet. Also on the tour was Emmaus Run Inn, a running store.

“When are you opening a store in Delaware?” Biden asked the owners in reference to the state where he’s lived for years after his family left Pennsylvania.

He also pointed to the press and joked: “Would you give them running shoes so they can take off?”

Sean Linehan, one of the shop’s owners, said Biden was “extremely personable,” speaking to staff and some customers about his initiatives and “how the strength and hope of our economy starts with small businesses like ours.”

“The White House advance team told us that initially it was going to be in Allentown, but they thought Emmaus had a nice small-town feel,” Linehan told lehighvalleylive.com.

Biden later traveled to the Mack Southside Fire Station in Allentown, home of the fire academy that opened in August with $2.3 million in American Rescue Plan funds.

There, the president told reporters business owners Friday relayed to him they’re still worried about their pocketbooks. But he noted the owners of the coffee shop said they have “started to gain faith” after seeing their business grow.

Asked about polls showing many Americans still have a sour view of the economy under his presidency, Biden said: “If you notice, they’re feeling much better about how the economy is doing. What we haven’t done is letting them know exactly who got it changed.”

But Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel released a statement Friday countering that view.

“With out of control crime and heartbreaking job cuts, Allentown is another unfortunate victim of Democrat control,” McDaniel said. “Today, Biden will have to face the very people his policies hurt. In November, small business owners, like ones he meets today, will vote for economic relief and safety in our Republican nominee.”

Republican state Sen. Jarrett Coleman, who represents part of Lehigh County, including a section of Allentown, was also dismissive.

“Bidenomics? Does anyone think that’s working? The thing about a healthy economy is that if we had one, the President wouldn’t have to convince people to get excited about it,” Coleman said in a statement. “Many of my constituents are struggling to make ends meet due to inflation.”

Dressed in a black coat and his trademark aviator sunglasses, Biden arrived at Lehigh Valley International Airport shortly after 1 p.m. aboard Air Force One.

He was greeted on the tarmac at their airport by several top Pennsylvania officials, all fellow Democrats: Gov. Josh Shapiro, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, U.S. Rep. Susan Wild of the Lehigh Valley, and Allentown Mayor Matt Tuerk. Casey and Wild also are running for another term this year.

In Emmaus, a throng of about 100 people stretched along Main Street behind barricades to catch a glimpse of the president as he arrived in town. Someone handed out American flags. One man held a different flag: It compared Biden to a donkey. Hundreds more people mulled about sidewalks in town.

When Biden arrived via motorcade, a handful of supporters of former President Donald Trump — Biden’s one-time and possibly future rival — yelled “Let’s go Brandon!” or “F**k Joe Biden!” Onlookers sitting on the deck of a house near the bike shop shouted at Biden: “Go home, Joe!” and “You’re a loser!”

There were plenty of Biden backers, too. And because Emmaus High School was released early Friday, there were pockets of high schoolers lingering.

One man on the porch of his business told a portion of the crowd: “Thank you all for coming to see me. Happy New Year!” Laughs ensued.

The presidential motorcade later took Biden to the Allentown Fire Academy, where dozens of pro-Palestine protestors lined the street chanting “Peace right now!” and “We will remember in November!” as the war between Hamas and Israel continues in the Middle East. There was a large police presence, with officers carrying shields.

After the Allentown stop, the motorcade traveled along Interstate 78 and Route 22, closed to other traffic, before arriving back at Lehigh Valley airport at 5:37 p.m., with Biden ascending the steps for takeoff en route to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, the press pool reported.

This was Biden’s second trip to Pennsylvania in a week, after he delivered a speech in Blue Bell last Friday. There, he painted Trump as a threat to democracy for his efforts to overturn and cast doubts on the 2020 presidential election.

He is also scheduled to visit Philadelphia on Monday for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service event, the White House said.

Friday’s trip comes as more than 70 Valley businesses closed last year. Several told lehighvalleylive.com they continued to face post-pandemic challenges and staffing shortages and expressed frustration by growing inflation costs.

But inflation in the U.S. has cooled more or less, falling to 3.4% after from a high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Meanwhile, the nation’s unemployment rate in November was 3.7%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from October.

Unemployment remains at a historic low in Pennsylvania, the state Department of Labor and Industry said in December. Adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the statewide rate was unchanged in November, remaining at the record low of 3.4% from October.

The Lehigh Valley’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in November was at a 20-year-low of 3.9%, according to the department, representing the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ Metropolitan Statistical Area that covers Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton and Warren counties.

The Valley also just celebrated a record gross domestic product of $50.2 billion in 2022, with manufacturing representing its biggest sector, according to the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corp. That GDP ranks 68th among the nation’s metro regions, with 12,100 jobs added over the last five years and 15,000-plus companies calling the Lehigh Valley home, the LVEDC said.

Among the area’s iconic brands are Mack Trucks, Martin Guitar, Olympus, Crayola, Air Products, B. Braun Medical, Lutron, and Just Born, maker of marshmallow Peeps and other candies.

Jan 05 2024,"US economy adds 216,000 jobs in December, beating expectations",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-december-2023,"The labor market ended 2023 on solid footing as job growth continued to chug along at a healthy pace in December.

Employers added 216,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, topping the 170,000 gain forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.

The report also contained sizable downward revisions to job growth during the previous two months. Gains for October and November were revised down by a total of 71,000 jobs to a respective 105,000 and 173,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is weaker than it previously appeared.

In total, the economy added about 2.7 million jobs over the course of 2023, down from 4.8 million in 2022.

AMERICANS IN THESE STATES ARE GETTING A PAY RAISE THIS YEAR

""The labor market and economy have normalized and are in a healthy place — not too hot, not too cold,"" said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group.

In another show of strength for the economy, average hourly earnings — a key measure of inflation — increased 0.4% for the month and remained up 4.1% from the same time one year ago. Both of those figures came in slightly ahead of expectations.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally cooling after nearly two years of interest rate hikes. Policymakers voted last month to leave their benchmark rate unchanged for a third straight time and hinted they could soon begin cutting rates amid signs the economy is gradually slowing.

Stocks fell after the surprisingly strong jobs data diminished the odds of aggressive Fed rate cuts. Pricing suggests the odds of a March rate cut fell precipitously on Friday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

DECEMBER JOBS REPORT MAY SHOW ‘COOLING TREND' IN THE LABOR MARKET

The payroll number ""probably disappointed bulls who have been riding expectations that a soft labor market will speed up rate cuts,"" said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at Morgan Stanley. ""Data like this may pump the brakes a bit. For now, the name of the game is patience. Rate cuts are still on the table, but investors will probably have to wait until the second half of the year.""

Larkin added, ""And the Fed has made clear it’s prepared to go the other direction if it thinks inflation is on the rise again.""

Fed officials are slated to hold their next policy-setting meeting at the end of January.

Job gains were mostly concentrated in a handful of sectors last month, with the biggest gains in government (52,000), leisure and hospitality (40,000) and health care (37,700). Hiring in construction also trended upward.

Those gains helped to offset job losses in transportation and warehousing, the result of a steep drop in the number of couriers and messengers.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown. However, there are some signs that cracks are beginning to appear after last year's blistering pace of growth.

""Don’t be fooled by the strong job report for December,"" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of finance and economics at Loyola Marymount University. ""The cooling trend in the labor market continues. Following a period of vigorous hiring after the pandemic, there's now a shift towards more cautious hiring strategies by businesses."""

""I don’t look at the economy through the eyes of Wall Street and Park Avenue. I look at it through the eyes of the people I grew up with in Scranton, Pennsylvania or Claymont, Delaware,"" Biden’s X account read on Monday.

Though some Democrats have pressed Biden to move away from discussing his ""Bidenomics"" strategy, the Biden administration has continued to double down on its alleged success.

Many other X users, however, did not agree.

Author Edward Dowd asked, ""And what did the fine folks in Scranton tell you? Are they more bullish on the economy than Wall Street or less? Seriously what are we saying here? What does this mean?""

""He looks at the economy through the eyes of a Socialist with dementia,"" podcast host Dr. Mark Young explained.

Former Republican congressional candidate Jack Lombardi wrote, ""Well then you should go ahead and admit your economy sucks. Because the average American, my fellow non-elite American, is struggling under your failed polices. Your record number of EOs you bragged about signing caused this.""

""Especially when they pay you $50K p/m in rent, amirite?"" immigration lawyer Matthew Kolken joked.

Actor Matthew Marsden argued, ""You have literally been in congress most of your life. Now ask yourself is the country better since you took office? You look at the economy through the eyes of a corrupt old fool who has run the country into the ground.""

""I can't speak for Scranton or Claymont, but I can tell you what the folks in Sedalia, Missouri are saying. They're not happy,"" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Mo., wrote.

Rep. John Carter, R-Texas, agreed, ""You can look at it however you want, but don't put lipstick on a pig and call it a beauty queen. #Bidenomics is killing the middle class from Pennsylvania and Delaware all the way down to Texas.""

HERE'S HOW BIDENOMICS IS CRUSHING DREAMS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES

A recent Fox News survey in October found that 62% of Americans disapproved of Biden’s handling of the economy with only 37% approval.

In addition, a Marquette University poll found former President Donald Trump had a 23- to 24-point lead with voters on handling inflation, the economy and the border. Trump also held a 19-point lead over Biden in voters' confidence in the candidate creating jobs.

Where they stand on the economy, crime and the border",CalMatters,center,https://calmatters.org/politics/2024/01/us-senate-california-candidates/,"In summary The five major contenders have different track records and proposals on some of the biggest issues facing California. They’re trying to position themselves to appeal to sizable voting blocs before the March 5 primary.

Lea este artículo en español.

The main contenders to become California’s new U.S. senator want voters to see them in a certain light:



Rep. Adam Schiff as a defender of democracy; Rep. Katie Porter as an anti-corruption crusader; Rep. Barbara Lee as a courageous progressive; Eric Early as a champion for the “forgotten Americans;” and Steve Garvey as a commonsense consensus builder.

But their ads, slogans and speeches offer only a glimpse into who they are, or what they have done — or plan to do — to tackle some of Californians’ most pressing concerns. All three Democrats have years of voting records while serving in Congress.

All but Early are set to debate for the first time in this race on Monday evening. Ahead of the event, CalMatters sent each campaign a questionnaire and analyzed their records and stances on issues such as border, immigration, criminal justice, foreign policy, economy, labor and housing.

Here’s a detailed look at where they stand on those issues — and how they differ from each other:

Border and immigration

The three Democrats share a similar track record on immigration and border security issues.

They all voted against Republican proposals to bar federally-funded housing to migrants, limit asylum eligibility and condemn the use of public school facilities to shelter migrants. They have all supported — or even co-sponsored — bills to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and their children, establish independent oversight on border security activities and limit the president’s ability to restrict undocumented immigrant entries.

All support expanding unemployment insurance benefits to undocumented immigrants seeking work.

At a November immigration forum, all three Democrats criticized President Joe Biden’s policy that banned most migrants from seeking asylum if they crossed the border illegally. Porter said the policy was “dishonoring this nation’s history and our future.” Schiff and Lee both called it “wrong.”

Biden — noting that previous congressional actions tied his hands — decided to continue building former President Donald Trump’s Mexican border wall in October, shocking some Democrats. The decision drew instant criticism from Lee, who urged White House to reverse course in a tweet.

Lee, Schiff and Porter all agreed a generic border wall is ineffective in response to CalMatters’ questionnaire this month. Schiff and Porter both advocated for increased use of detection technologies at the border.

Porter, however, said some “site-specific” barriers do work, “for example, in dangerous areas where the lives of migrants and U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel are at risk when there are unauthorized crossings and search and rescue missions.”

Of the three Democrats, Lee appears to be the most staunch critic of allocating more funds to federal border patrol agencies.

In 2019, Lee voted against authorizing a $4.6 billion humanitarian aid and security funding package at the southern border, while Schiff and Porter voted in favor. The package — backed by Republicans and moderate Democrats — passed the House without the stronger protections in migrant facilities that House progressives had supported.

Lee called for a 50% budget cut for the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol in statements to CalMatters. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security, she said, would be better spent on “meaningful immigration reform.”

“ICE is rotten to the core,” Lee said in response to the CalMatters questionnaire. She is the only Senate candidate to have voted against creating the agency in 2002, when Schiff — then in his first term — supported it.

Porter told CalMatters she generally does not support additional funding for the agency, but said she wants border patrol employees to “receive pay commensurate with their work” to help “recruit a workforce that can meet the needs of our border communities.”

Schiff said Congress should provide aid to border communities and increase resources and personnel at ports of entry to help handle an influx of asylum seekers.

The top two Republicans — Garvey and Early — both support the border wall, additional funding for border patrol agents and tightened restrictions on border entries. Both said the nation should prioritize immigration applications from people legally present in the United States and both oppose offering undocumented immigrants unemployment benefits.

Early argued he supports a path to citizenship for “illegal immigrants who have enlisted in and participated honorably in our military.” Currently, non-citizens can only join the military if they are legal permanent residents, but a Democrats-backed bill in Congress would allow undocumented DREAMers to serve in the military.

Garvey visited the Mexico border as one of his first campaign events last month and said he wants to complete the wall.

Crime and guns

On this topic, the Republican and Democratic candidates seem to share some common ground.

They have all stressed the need to invest in mental health services as well as policing to address crime, but the devil’s in the details.

The three Democrats want more funding to reform policing methods. They all voted for de-escalation training for police, more federal dollars for violence intervention initiatives and restricting police use of chokeholds after George Floyd’s death at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.

Garvey and Early’s campaigns called for more funding for police departments and law enforcement officers, as well as the need to secure the southern border.

All three Democrats support boosting funding for mental health treatment programs. Lee — arguing poverty is the root cause of crime — believes raising the minimum wage, expanding access to healthcare and legalizing marijuana will address the “structural problems” that lead to criminal acts, her campaign says.

Porter’s campaign championed her Mental Health Justice Act — a 2022 bill to give grants to governments to recruit and train mental health professionals to respond to emergency calls. Schiff and Lee both voted for the measure.

Garvey’s campaign said he also supports funding to treat mental health problems and drug addiction, arguing they often contribute to gun violence and homelessness. Early, via a campaign spokesperson, advocated for a “rebuild” of the nation’s mental health system “that allows for the severely mentally ill to be permanently housed and cared for,” arguing that services were “decimated” in the 1960s — when people were discharged from institutions and placed in community-based care centers amid the civil rights movement.

On gun policies, Garvey supports “common-sense measures” such as pre-sale background checks and an assault weapon ban — something mainly supported by Democrats, according to his campaign. “We can keep guns out of the hands of criminals while also protecting Second Amendment rights,” his campaign said in a response to CalMatters’ questions.

The candidates are otherwise split along party lines. For example, all three Democrats oppose the federal death penalty, while Republicans argue the opposite.

But there are nuanced differences, especially among Democrats. They all voted against legislation to permanently raise fentanyl-related drugs to the highest class of illegal substances — a GOP-led bill Biden urged Congress to pass. Lee, however, was the only candidate to vote against even temporarily doing so.

Schiff — a former prosecutor in Los Angeles — has the most controversial track record on criminal justice issues due to his past support for tough-on-crime policies.

Schiff was among 48 Democrats to support the Thin Blue Line Act in 2017 to apply the federal death penalty to cop killers — something Early supports. Schiff has since publicly spoken against the sentence. In his campaign response to CalMatters, Schiff credited his change of heart to “technological advancements” that revealed “deep flaws” with the death penalty and a “disproportionate application” of the sentence on people of color.

As a state senator, Schiff authored legislation to crack down on juveniles, including a bill to create year-long “boot camps” for teenagers found in possession of marijuana at school and another to try kids 14 years and older as adults if they commit murder or rape.

In Congress, he introduced legislation in 2009 to increase funding to a controversial program to place more cops in communities, supported language to exclude asylum seekers and immigrants from privacy protections and voted for the Protect and Serve Act in 2018 to impose stricter penalties on assaulting law enforcement officers, which most Democrats voted for. Lee voted against both measures.

Schiff’s record irked criminal justice activists, who in a 2021 letter urged Gov. Gavin Newsom not to appoint Schiff as the next state attorney general. He has since softened some of his positions on criminal justice. In February 2023, he said his viewpoint had changed since the 1990s. “I’ve learned that some of the policies of the 90s didn’t work,” he told ABC7 last year.

Foreign policy and defense

The issue of a ceasefire in the Gaza war highlights a key split among the three Democratic hopefuls.

A day after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Lee called for a permanent ceasefire from the stage of a Senate candidate debate — one of the first members of Congress to do so. Schiff called for “unequivocal support” for Israel, while Porter cautioned against Islamophobia and mourned the lives lost on both sides.

For months afterward, as the casualty numbers rose in Gaza, Schiff and Porter both called for a “humanitarian pause” — aligning with the Biden administration’s policy. But as calls for a permanent ceasefire grew, Porter shifted her stance in a Dec. 18 statement, calling for a “lasting bilateral ceasefire” that “brings remaining hostages home, secures Israel’s safety, removes Hamas from operational control of Gaza, and invests in creating a better economic and political architecture for Palestinians in Gaza.”

When asked to explain why she shifted her stance, Porter’s campaign pointed to her Dec. 18 statement, in which she seemed to suggest Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of Palestinian governance of Gaza was the reason.

“His remarks and actions necessitate tough conversations with our ally Israel about its long-term strategy and among U.S. policymakers about our approach in the Middle East,” she said in the statement.

Schiff, however, has stood by his initial position, arguing that a permanent ceasefire would “perpetuate Hamas terrorist control of Gaza,” according to his campaign.

All three Democrats signed on as co-sponsors of a largely symbolic bipartisan House resolution affirming Israel’s right to defend itself. But Lee was the only candidate to vote against the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act — a bipartisan bill that would sanction Hamas, its affiliates and governments providing aid to the group.

“The bill was opposed by major humanitarian organizations because it is overly broad and will hurt a lot of innocent Palestinians by making it harder if not impossible to receive humanitarian assistance,” Lee spokesperson Sean Ryan told CalMatters in an email.

Decades before Gaza, Lee shocked the world by being the lone vote against the Afghanistan war after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, a decision that got her death threats then but now hailed as a show of courage by her supporters.

Lee is still somewhat of a unicorn on foreign policy compared to her opponents.

In 2002, Lee voted against authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, while Schiff voted in favor. Lee has since sponsored a resolution to repeal the authorization most years; it wasn’t until 2021 that the House passed it, with Schiff and Porter both voting in favor.

Lee was also the only candidate to support a U.S. troop removal from Syria in March 2023 — a measure most Democrats, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, voted against. Critics of the bill said a removal could give Islamic State terrorists time to reorganize, the Associated Press reported.

Additionally, Lee touts herself as the most consistent in calling for cutting the nation’s “bloated” defense budget. She has voted against authorizing defense and military spending when Schiff and Porter voted in favor, voting records show.

Schiff’s campaign said he wants to reduce the Pentagon’s budget by 10% and supports eliminating weapons systems the administration does not need or want. “There is far too much waste in the defense budget that must be eliminated,” his campaign said.

Porter’s campaign said the funding level needs to be indexed to national security threats and there needs to be more oversight. “I’ll never rubber stamp spending, but I believe investing in our servicemembers and their well-being is paramount,” the campaign said.

Both Republicans support increasing the defense budget. Neither Garvey nor Early supported a call for a ceasefire. They both argued Israel must have the ability to fight Hamas until it is destroyed, their campaigns said.

Economy and labor

Although far lower than during the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation remains high, jumping from 3.1% to 3.4% in December. Experts attribute it to the rising cost of housing, and project it’s unlikely to last given a housing market cool-down, NBC reported.

Republican candidates blame the Biden administration. Garvey attributed it to “excessive government spending” while Early criticized the reduction of domestic energy production — a GOP talking point that conflicts with record-high U.S. oil production in October.

Democrats slam corporations instead. Porter — a self-proclaimed warrior taking on Wall Street interests — argued inflation worsened because businesses are overcharging customers, pointing to record-high profits for big corporations. Similarly, Lee blamed corporate greed. Apart from corporate profit, Schiff pointed to the supply chain interruption during the pandemic and a lack of housing as contributing factors.

Among the three Democrats, Schiff — a past member of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition — has historically been the most skeptical of federal spending. In 2005, he demanded a “rainy-day” reserve in the budget.

Schiff is the only Senate candidate to vote in favor of raising the debt ceiling last year to avoid a default. Lee and Porter — along with 38 other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus — voted against it. Lee said she voted to stand up against “extreme MAGA Republicans holding our economy hostage,” and Porter — who has argued the debt ceiling should be abolished — criticized the measure for including “giveaways” to the oil and gas industry, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Schiff, who applied to join the Congressional Progressive Caucus last year but withdrew, voted multiple times against the “People’s Budget” — which contains all the caucus’ priorities and which has served as a purity test. Lee — the only other candidate in Congress at the time — voted in favor.

Lee is also the only candidate to sponsor the Curtail Executive Overcompensation Act, a measure increasing taxes on corporate CEOs. Lee and Porter are both sponsoring the Oligarch Act, another measure aimed to tax the rich, while Schiff is not. Schiff has, however, expressed support for repealing tax cuts for the wealthy made under the Trump administration.

All three Democrats have gained union endorsements, although Schiff has won the most from statewide unions. All the Democrats support the Protecting the Right to Organize Act to override all state right-to-work laws and strengthen union protections. Garvey and Early both said that the decision belongs to states, not the federal government, according to their campaigns.

The five candidates also split along party lines on whether striking workers should be eligible for unemployment benefits — a controversial bill vetoed by Gov. Newsom last year. All three Democrats said those workers deserve the benefits. Early outright said no, while Garvey’s campaign told CalMatters that governments should stay out of disputes between unions and businesses.

All three Democrats believe the federal minimum wage — $7.25 per hour — should increase.

Lee called for a $50 hourly minimum wage during a forum last year, noting that’s the living wage one working adult with two children would have to make, according to an Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimate.

Porter’s campaign said she supports a $20 federal minimum wage and $25 for California, indexed to inflation. Schiff’s campaign said he supports a $20 federal minimum wage indexed to inflation, with a boost to $25 for health care workers.

Early believes the federal rate does not need to change and that an increase would worsen inflation, according to his campaign.

Garvey, on the other hand, did not give a specific number. “Each state and its voters have the ability to raise their minimum wage, as California has multiple times, beyond the federal minimum wage,” his campaign said.

Homelessness and housing

On California’s worsening homelessness crisis, Republican candidates say mental health problems are the main culprit — not the lack of affordable housing.

Early, in his campaign’s response to CalMatters’ questions, said the cause of the state’s homelessness is “severe mental illness” and “soft-on-crime” policies, referring to Proposition 47 — a ballot measure passed in 2014 that reduced penalties for certain thefts and drug offenses.

“The biggest factor is manifestly not insufficient low-income housing,” the campaign’s statement read.

Garvey’s campaign said the biggest driving factors of the problem are “drug and alcohol addiction” and “mental health issues.” During a Wednesday visit to a Sacramento homeless encampment, he said he wants a “deep dive” into how taxpayer dollars are spent to battle the homelessness crisis.

But the Democratic candidates all argued a lack of affordable housing is driving the crisis.

The homelessness problem is a “direct result” of failed federal housing policies over the past decades, Porter argues on her website. Her campaign said she supports a “major investment” in housing, including a fully-funded federal Section 8 program and an expansion of the national Low Income Housing Tax Credit.

Lee’s campaign said homelessness is a housing issue “at its core.” Like Porter, she also called for a fully-funded Section 8 program and a national rent control standard — one that the Biden administration has pushed for. She believes expanding health care access, offering free college and raising the minimum wage would help ease homelessness in the state, her campaign said. She also touted legislation she introduced to help renters, such as the DEPOSIT Act, which would allow federal programs to cover security deposit and moving expenses for those using the Housing Choice vouchers.

Similarly, Schiff’s campaign said he also supports expanding Section 8 vouchers and providing wraparound services. Additionally, his campaign stressed the importance of easing regulations and offering tax incentives to encourage the build-out of affordable housing — something Garvey and Early also support.

On Schiff’s campaign website, he touted legislation he introduced and supported to fight homelessness, including the Affordable and Homeless Housing Incentive Act, which would offer tax incentives for homeless shelters.

Asked if they support more federal funding to combat the crisis, only Early’s campaign said no. Garvey’s campaign said funding for housing should prioritize projects in “low-income areas, and near job and transit centers.”

Schiff and Lee have both touted their success securing earmarked funds for housing and homelessness. Porter, however, is a staunch opponent of earmark requests, arguing the funding goes to lawmakers’ “pet projects” and requests should be rejected. She has signed onto letters instead, urging her colleagues to approve grants to homelessness assistance programs."

Dec 08 2023,"The US economy added 199,000 jobs in November",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/08/economy/november-jobs-report-final/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN —

The US economy notched another solid month of job growth, with an added lift from actors and autoworkers coming off the picket lines.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday.

“The economy’s still humming along,” Jane Oates, a former Department of Labor official who is president of employment education nonprofit WorkingNation, told CNN. “For the past two weeks, all we’ve heard is doom and gloom about how this is going to be a terrible day. And it was a much better day than was predicted.”

Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady, according to Refinitiv.

The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 62.8%, returning to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate increase is a “positive underlying context to the unemployment rate decline,” wrote Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, in commentary issued Friday.

One-time boosts

The largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated 93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing saw a boost, too, largely because of the return of striking autoworkers, which lifted motor vehicles and parts employment by 30,000 jobs.

Additionally, the resolution of the Screen Actors Guild strike against Hollywood studios resulted in 17,200 jobs added in the motion picture and sound recording industries.

In total, the BLS was anticipating a net gain of 35,000 workers returning after strikes: The agency estimated that 61,000 workers were absent from the labor market due to labor disputes, versus 96,000 the month before.

Taking into account those one-time gains, the underlying rate of job growth is likely around 160,000 jobs per month, which aligns with the 2019 average, wrote Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter.

November’s jobs number is in line with the strong monthly gains hit in the decade before the pandemic, when 183,000 jobs per month were added. The current rate of job growth also is well above the “neutral rate,” or what’s needed to keep up with population growth.

“It is critical to put this data in the proper context,” Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist of RSM US, wrote in a note on Friday. “Given long-term demographic changes and structural transformation of the US economy to keep employment stable, only 75,000 jobs per month need to be created, in contrast with the roughly 200,000 that was the case just over a decade ago.”

Retail drop-off

The biggest declines occurred in the retail trade and temporary help services sectors, which lost 38,400 jobs and 13,600 jobs, respectively.

“The [reason for the] reduction of jobs in retail is very similar to the reduction of jobs in other places, except retail hasn’t been able to absorb — and that’s technology,” Oates said.

As e-commerce and in-store pick-ups become more engrained in how people shop, that leads to fewer people needed at the brick-and-mortar level.

What this means for the Fed

November’s job growth was stronger than October’s unrevised tally of 150,000 jobs added. September’s job gains were revised down to 262,000 from 297,000, according to the BLS.

The continued strength in the labor market has helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth, but Federal Reserve officials believe slower demand (and slower wage growth) will help bring down inflation.

Friday’s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in November from the month before, showing a more accelerated pace of growth than the 0.2% uptick seen in October and the 0.3% expected by economists.

On an annual basis, however, wage gains eased to 4% from the 4.1% rate seen a month before.

Through November, the economy has added an average of 232,000 jobs per month — far more moderate growth than 2022 and 2021, when an estimated 399,000 and 606,000 jobs were added every month, respectively.

Friday’s strong jobs report likely keeps the Fed’s options open, although cooling inflation should mean that another pause is in store when the central bank meets next week, wrote Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist.

“Labor market endurance will lead Fed officials to retain some optionality for future rate hikes, if needed,” she wrote. “We expect policymakers will resist talking about rate cuts until early 2024.”"
Dec 28 2023,"Housing, inflation, interest rates and more: What to expect in the 2024 economy",NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/what-expect-2024-economy-buying-house-inflation-recession-rcna130790,"A slowdown — but no recession.

That's the broad consensus for the economy among experts as we head into 2024. After a post-pandemic period that saw growth surpass most forecasts — but also spurred breakneck inflation — Americans should now expect a period of reduced business activity.

Yet while some economists believe the risk of a recession will remain, others think a ""soft landing"" is more likely. That oft-talked-about scenario is understood as a combination of milder inflation alongside slow-and-steady employment growth.

""There's more hope for it [a soft landing] going into 2024 than there had been heading into 2023,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst for Bankrate.

The forecast among many economists for a recession in 2023 did not come to pass. Indeed, from a purely data-driven perspective, history may consider this year to be a good one, as low unemployment and rapidly declining inflation prevailed.

Today, the unemployment rate stands at 3.7% — little changed from the 3.5% seen one year ago. The annual rate of inflation, meanwhile, has fallen to 3.1%, less than half of the 7.1% rate seen in November 2022.

As a result, consumer confidence has grown. In the most recent survey by the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research organization, good economic vibes among consumers rocketed to the highest reading since July.

Warning signs on the horizon

With additional context, each of these measures point to a slowdown on the horizon. The unemployment rate is up from the 3.4% low reached in April. And despite coming off the near double-digit highs in June 2022, inflation has not been able to break below 3%. In fact, it has bounced around in that 3% range for six consecutive months.

As for consumer confidence, it is still well below the post-pandemic high recorded in the spring of 2021.

Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the unemployment rate is likely to increase to around 4% as consumers pull back on spending, causing job growth to slow.

But while the risk of recession remains ""elevated,"" it likely won't occur unless there is a negative shock to the global economy, like wider conflict in the Middle East, where Israel is at war with Hamas fighters in Gaza, Faucher said.

""It [a recession] is less likely now than it was three or six months ago, just because of the ongoing strength we've seen,"" Faucher added.

The economy has already slowed thanks to high interest rates, something consumers will continue to encounter in 2024, Bankrate’s McBride said. The Federal Reserve has kept rates elevated in its ongoing effort to wrestle inflation, and it isn't likely to reduce them anytime soon.

Right now, credit card interest rates continue to average more than 20%. And even though mortgage rates are just starting to decline, the average 30-year interest rate still hovers around 6.5% to 7% — and even higher in certain faster-growing regions of the country. That range is about the same for car loans, too.

""Interest rates took the elevator going up, but are going to take the stairs coming down,"" McBride said. While some Federal Reserve officials have begun to signal they would be open to cutting rates next year, McBride said they would come down ""at a very modest rate.""

""We're going to be in a high-interest-rate environment for some time,"" he said.

Still, many consumers have weathered this environment, and will continue to do so next year, experts say.

In commentary released this week, Bank of America economists said ""net wealth"" has grown for many Americans, thanks to higher home prices and a banner year for the stock market. This will continue to fuel a healthy rate of purchasing, they said.

""Understanding the consumer continues to be more about 'watch what I do and not what I say,'"" the economists wrote, suggesting that shoppers are still comfortable with spending money even as they express concerns about the economy.

The economists added that recent retail sales reports indicate holiday spending this year ""was more favorable than many expected,"" while total hours worked have continued to expand.

Of course, this sunnier scenario of staying afloat financially without much difficulty does not apply to all Americans. The Bank of America economists note that when it comes to how savings and housing affordability have been distributed since the pandemic, many households are far from well-off.

And Bankrate's McBride estimates that some 60% of Americans now live paycheck to paycheck.

Yet overall, ""it appears the U.S. consumer is cooling, not retrenching,"" the Bank of America economists said."
Jan 09 2024,"Global economy headed for worst half-decade in 30 years, World Bank warns",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/09/world-bank-global-economy/,"The global economy will slow in 2024 for the third straight year and appears headed for its weakest half-decade since the early 1990s, the World Bank said Tuesday in its latest annual forecast. While higher interest rates appear to be bringing inflation under control without the serious financial crisis or soaring unemployment that many had feared, the global economy’s overall performance is lagging, said Indermit Gill, the bank’s top economist.

After rebounding sharply in 2021 from the depths of the pandemic, the global economy grew by 3 percent in 2022, dipped to a 2.6 percent rate last year and is expected to post a tepid 2.4 percent this year, the bank said in its annual Global Economic Prospects report. Those rates lag the 3.1 percent average for the decade of the 2010s.

The continuing slowdown all but guarantees that world leaders will fail to meet the 2030 development goals that 193 members of the United Nations, including the United States, agreed to in 2015. Governments pledged to transform the global economy by the end of this decade by setting 17 ambitious aims, including eliminating extreme poverty, cutting greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half, boosting education for the poor and eradicating hunger.

The measures were not legally binding. But resulting from three years of negotiations, and introduced at the United Nations with an address from Pope Francis, they were seen as packing a moral punch.

“The 2020s have so far been a period of broken promises. Governments across the world have fallen short of the ‘unprecedented’ goals they promised to meet by 2020,” Gill wrote in a foreword to the report, which labeled the outlook “wretched.”

In a quarter of the world’s developing countries, people are poorer today than they were before the pandemic, the bank said.

“When you look at the big picture, it’s not pleasant,” said Ayhan Kose, the bank’s deputy chief economist.

Still, the bank celebrated progress in bringing inflation under control, as supply chain kinks were ironed out and higher borrowing costs cooled business activity. Globally, inflation is expected to average 3.7 percent this year, down from 5.3 percent in 2023.

But prices are likely to continue rising faster than central banks such as the Federal Reserve say is advisable well into this year.

“I suggest we don’t pop the champagne yet,” Kose said.

The bank’s forecast calls for the United States to grow at a 1.6 percent rate this year, roughly twice as fast as Europe or Japan. China is expected to grow by 4.5 percent, down from an estimated 5.2 percent last year as its post-covid reopening fades.

In the long run, slowing growth is a problem for advanced economies and middle-income countries alike. One reason for anemic growth in the latter is a sharp drop in investment spending, which is running at barely half the average rate seen in the past two decades.

By implementing policy changes such as expanded trade and capital flows and government budget discipline, developing countries could fuel an investment boom, the bank said, citing historical examples. In 192 episodes since 1950, countries such as Chile, Colombia and Turkey increased annual economic growth rates by almost one-third thanks to sharply higher spending on new plants and equipment.

In such periods, developing countries expanded their economies by around 40 percent over six years, the report said.

While bank economists expect a good-but-not-great year, they warned that conditions are more likely to disappoint than to produce a positive surprise. The war in Gaza — coupled with ongoing hostilities in Ukraine — could sideswipe global growth. Escalation of the fighting in the Middle East would probably send oil prices well above their current $75-per-barrel level, dampening growth and lifting inflation.

Attacks on shipping through the Red Sea have prompted cargo vessels to take the longer, costlier route around the southern tip of Africa. Over the 10 days ending Jan. 2, the volume of trade through the Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, dropped 28 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund."

Sep 20 2023,"The United Auto Workers Is Overplaying Its Hand, Risking Our Economy and the Election",New York Times (Opinion),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/opinion/uaw-strike-economy-biden.html,"The United Auto Workers has taken to the picket lines in a particularly acrimonious strike, targeting, for the first time, all three of the big Detroit automakers simultaneously.

Popular opinion appears to lie firmly on the union side. And I’m all for the auto workers getting paid more — they have legitimate concerns. But this increasingly militant U.A.W. is overplaying its hand with an overly lengthy and overly ambitious list of demands. I don’t think there’s any way the automakers will be able to meet these conditions, and I worry about the implications for our economy and for President Biden.

The stakes are high. A prolonged strike, which could lead to far more widespread shutdowns of auto facilities, could jeopardize the economic recovery. Our nearly $800 billion auto industry accounts for 3 percent of economic output, with a particular concentration in the Midwest, where states like Michigan are critical to President Biden’s re-election.

How did we get here? In some ways, these strikes were long overdue.

For much of American economic history, workers’ incomes tracked closely to improvements in their efficiency. The more a typical laborer produced, the higher the pay. But over the last two decades, that relationship has broken down: Productivity grew by 52 percent from 2000 to today, while hourly compensation, after adjustment for inflation, increased by just 30 percent. That occurred for a variety of reasons, ranging from declining unionization to competition from lower cost imports to increased corporate concentration amid waning antitrust enforcement."

Aug 29 2023,The Federal Reserve Must Pay Attention: China’s Economy Is in Serious Trouble,American Enterprise Institute,right,https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-federal-reserve-must-pay-attention-chinas-economy-is-in-serious-trouble/,"A disturbing characteristic of Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve is how US-centric it has become. In following its data-dependent interest rate policy, the Fed makes little reference to world economic developments in general and to those in China in particular. It does so even though those developments could materially impact our economy. This is all the more surprising at a time when China, the world’s second-largest economy and, until recently, its main engine of growth, is in deep economic trouble. It is also surprising when that country appears to be on the cusp of deflation and is causing a marked softening in international commodity prices.

China’s Economy Is in Trouble

At the heart of China’s current economic malaise is a series of egregious economic policy mistakes under President Xi’s watch. These mistakes include an over-reliance on a credit fueled housing market and export-led economic growth model. They also include an economically disastrous zero-Covid tolerance policy and a heavy-handed clampdown on the all-important tech sector that has undermined investor confidence.

It is also hardly helping matters that China is now paying the economic price for its earlier one-child policy that is now leading to the shrinking of its population. Or that its economic relations with the United States have soured under both the Trump and the Biden Administrations. Nor is it helpful that US and European companies are making serious efforts to reduce their reliance on the Chinese supply chain.

The depth of China’s economic troubles is underlined by the difficulties it is experiencing in its housing and export sector. According to a study by Harvard’s Kenneth Rogoff, housing activity accounts for almost 30 percent of the Chinese economy.

Meanwhile, the IMF estimates that Chinese exports account for almost 20 percent of the country’s GDP. This implies that at least half the Chinese economy is in deep trouble.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) frequently reminds us that over the past decade, China experienced a housing and credit market bubble that was of a similar size to that which Japan experienced in the run up to its lost economic decade in the 1990s. Housing prices in relation to income in China’s major cities have come to exceed those in London and New York while credit to the non-financial private sector increased by a staggering 100 percent of GDP. There is now every indication that those bubbles are bursting.

Over the past year, many Chinese property developers, now including most notably Countrywide, have defaulted on their loans. Meanwhile, house prices have fallen steadily over the past year, housing starts are in a deep slump, local governments are experiencing financial difficulties due to slumping land sales, and the housing market continues to be characterized by literally many millions of unoccupied dwellings. With China’s population now declining, it is difficult to see how the country can grow its way out of its housing and credit market difficulties.

At the same time that its housing market is stumbling, its export engine appears to be sputtering. It is doing so in the context of a slowing world economy and of efforts by foreign companies to re-source their supply chains. According to the most recent economic data, over the past year Chinese exports fell by as much as 14 percent.

All of this suggests that the US and world economies cannot count on the Chinese economy as they have in the past to provide a counter weight to their economic slowdowns with rapid Chinese economic growth. While to be sure our economy has limited direct exposure to China, the same is not true for China’s Asian partners, Australia, Germany, and the commodity exporting emerging market economies. All of those countries have strong Chinese trade links.

If a Chinese economic slowdown adversely affects those countries, our economy too will be affected indirectly through a less favorable world economic environment.

Help on Inflation?

However, the upside to China’s current economic troubles is that it might supply much needed inflation relief to the rest of the world economy. With China’s producer prices now declining at a rapid clip and with its currency depreciating, we can expect lower Chinese export prices.

More importantly yet, a Chinese economic slump must be expected to lead to a further softening in international commodity prices in general and in oil prices in particular.

The major slowing that we are now witnessing in the Chinese economy has to raise a basic question for the Federal Reserve. At a time when the world’s second largest economy is showing every sign that it could soon be exporting meaningful deflationary pressure to the rest of the world economy, might the Fed not be risking monetary policy overkill by hewing to its aggressive interest rate hiking policy?"

Odds of a soft landing may have just gotten a little better.

The latest employment report from the Labor Department shows job growth held steady last month, boosting hopes that the Federal Reserve may be able to curb inflation without triggering a sharp jump in unemployment.

U.S. employers added 187,000 jobs in July. While job growth has moderated, it hasn't come close to stalling, even after the Fed raised interest rates to the highest level in 22 years.

Here are five takeaways from the report.

Keeping up with population growth

Over the last three months, employers have added an average of 217,000 jobs per month.

That's down from an average of 312,000 jobs in the first three months of the year, but it's still a healthy pace of growth.

Employers are still adding more than enough jobs each month to keep pace with population growth.

Health care, hospitality and construction were among the industries adding jobs in July, while factories and transportation saw modest job cuts.

Historically low unemployment

The unemployment rate dipped to 3.5% in July from 3.6% the month before. The jobless rate has hovered in a narrow range for more than a year, hitting a half-century low of 3.4% in April.

Unemployment among African Americans hit a record low of 4.7% that month before rebounding to 6% in June — raising some concerns. In a relief, the African American jobless rate dipped again in July to 5.8%.

It's best to take those numbers with a grain of salt. The figures can be noisy because of the relatively small sample size.

People are earning more

Here's another bit of positive news: Wages are finally outpacing inflation, boosting workers' buying power.

Average wages in July were up 4.4% from a year ago. Wage gains have moderated in the last year, but inflation has cooled as well, so workers' paychecks now stretch farther.

For the twelve months ending in June wages rose 4.4%, while prices climbed just 3%. (The inflation rate for the year ending in July will be released next week.)

Coming off the sidelines

The number of people working, or looking for work, increased by 152,000 last month.

Importantly, the share of people in their prime working years (ages 25-54) who are in the labor force is growing. After hitting a two-decade high in June, it fell just slightly last month.

That's important, because a growing workforce allows the economy to expand without putting upward pressure on inflation.

And it's good news for women

Before the pandemic, women briefly outnumbered men on U.S. payrolls.

The ranks of working women fell sharply in 2020, when schools and restaurants were shuttered and many women were forced to leave work to look after family members or for other reasons.

Women's share of jobs has been slowly recovering, however, thanks in part to job growth in health care and education — fields where women outnumber men. (In contrast, the male-dominated manufacturing industry lost 2,000 jobs last month.)

As of July, women held 49.9% of all payroll jobs, up from 49.8% the month before."

Aug 19 2023,Russia’s ruble has tumbled. What does it mean for the wartime economy?,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/why-is-ruble-falling-ee777eeaf897d42befae052336fc35d5,"Russia’s ruble has fallen a long way in recent months, and the country’s central bank has stepped in to try to halt the slide.

Until now, the government stood aside as the declining ruble helped its budget. But a weaker currency also poses the threat of higher prices for everyday people in Russia — and the government has finally moved to halt the drop.

Here are key things to know:

WHY IS THE RUBLE FALLING?

Russia is selling less abroad — mainly reflected in falling revenue from oil and natural gas — and it’s importing more. People or companies importing goods to Russia means selling rubles for foreign currency like dollars or euros. That lowers the ruble’s exchange rate.

Russia’s trade surplus — meaning it sells more goods than it buys — has shrunk. Previously, Russia saw a large trade surplus — which typically supports a country’s currency — because of high oil prices and plummeting imports after invading Ukraine.

But oil prices have dipped this year, and it’s more cumbersome for Russia to sell its oil due to Western sanctions, including price caps on crude and oil products like diesel.

Meanwhile, imports have started to recover after nearly a year and a half of war as Russians find ways around sanctions. Some trade has been rerouted to Asian countries that are not participating in sanctions. And importers have found ways to ship goods through nearby countries such as Armenia, Georgia and Kazakhstan.

At the same time, Russia has ramped up defense spending, pumping money into companies that make weapons, for instance. Companies must import parts and raw materials, while some government money winds up in the pockets of workers who buy imported goods.

That government spending, along with the willingness of India and China to buy Russia oil, is helping the economy perform better than many had expected. The International Monetary Fund said last month that it expects Russia’s economy to grow 1.5% this year.

WHY DID THE CENTRAL BANK RAISE INTEREST RATES?

To fight inflation, first of all.

A weaker ruble worsens inflation by making imports more expensive in Russian currency. And the ruble’s weakness is increasingly being passed through to prices people pay. Inflation hit 7.6% over the past three months.

Higher interest rates will make it more expensive to get credit, and that should limit domestic demand for goods — including imports. So the central bank is trying to cool off the domestic economy to lower inflation.

It raised its key interest rate from 8.5% to 12% at an emergency meeting Tuesday after the ruble’s fall was criticized by a Kremlin economic adviser.

DOES THIS MEAN SANCTIONS ARE WORKING?

Sanctions are having an impact even if they are not collapsing the economy. Exports — and thus the ruble — have fallen because Western allies have boycotted Russian oil and imposed a price cap on oil exports to non-Western nations. The sanctions prevent insurers or shippers who are mainly based in the West from handling Russian oil above $60 a barrel.

The cap and boycott have forced Russia to sell at a discount and take expensive steps such as obtaining a fleet of ghost tankers that are beyond the reach of sanctions.

However, higher oil prices have recently sent the cost of Moscow’s supplies above the price cap, the International Energy Agency said in an August report.

Oil revenue fell 23% in the first half of this year but Russia still earned $425 million a day from oil sales, according to the Kyiv School of Economics.

The rebound in imports shows that Russia is finding ways around sanctions and boycotts. It’s expensive and cumbersome, but if someone needs an iPhone or a Western-made car, they can get it.

IS RUSSIA HAVING AN ECONOMIC CRISIS?

No, says Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. “The lower ruble is partly a reflection of the effect of sanctions, but it doesn’t indicate an underlying economic crisis.”

The falling ruble actually has helped the government with its budget. It means more rubles for every dollar of earnings from oil and other products Russia sells. That bolsters spending on the military and on social programs aimed at blunting the impact of sanctions on the Russian people.

“They’ve tried to compensate for the drop in the dollar value of oil receipts with the weaker ruble, so that therefore the deficit in terms of spending could be contained and more manageable,” Weafer said.

Amid sanctions and restrictions on moving money out of the country, the ruble exchange rate is largely in the hands of the central bank, Weafer said. It can tell major exporters when to exchange their dollar earnings into Russian currency.

“The weakness was planned, but it’s overdone and they want to pull it back,” Weafer said.

Janis Kluge, a Russian economy expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said the ruble decline is “not very welcome” to the Kremlin.

While not a full-blown crisis, “this is the closest we came to a real economic problem since the start of the war,” Kluge said.

The chaos at the start of sanctions was far worse, but since then, the ruble decline “is the first time that something seems to be not so much under control,” he said.

Any boost to the budget from a lower ruble, he said, is offset by higher spending on government wages and pensions, which are indexed to the inflation caused by the lower ruble.

“Whatever gives the impression of a weak or unstable economy is not welcomed by the Russian government,” he said. “In Russia, the exchange rate is always seen as the most important indicator of the health of the economy.”

WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR RUSSIANS?

Inflation caused by ruble devaluation hits low-income people hard because they spend more on necessities like food.

While higher interest rates will dampen economic growth, relieving some pressure on prices, the government is unlikely to back off on military spending.

“So it’s a clear prioritization of the government of this war over the welfare of households,” Kluge said.

Foreign travel — enjoyed mostly by a minority in big cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg — gets much more expensive with a weaker ruble.

“The instability of the national currency always has a not so good impact,” said Dina Solovyova, 51, a veterinarian. “Most likely, this will affect ordinary people, because the rise in prices for everything will surely follow. We’ll wait and see.”

Nikolay Rubtsov, a 20-year-old student, indicated he wasn’t much disturbed by the ruble’s fall.

“This is all temporary. I think everything will be back to normal soon. I don’t think it can last long,” Rubtsov said in Moscow.

Aug 16 2023,Deadly Maui wildfires inflict multibillion-dollar blow to Hawaii’s economy,Fox Business,right,https://foxbusiness.com/economy/deadly-maui-wildfires-inflict-multibillion-dollar-blow-hawaiis-economy,"The deadly wildfire on Maui that devastated the town of Lahaina and left catastrophic damage in their wake delivered a multibillion-dollar hit to the island’s economy according to a new economic analysis.

The wildfire, which started in early August and expanded rapidly because of winds from an offshore hurricane, swept through the town of Lahaina, a tourist hotspot that had an estimated population of 12,000 people. The wildfire is responsible for at least 99 deaths, making it the deadliest to occur in the U.S. in over a century, and search efforts continue for the hundreds who remain missing as of Tuesday.

""Obviously, the foremost issue is the human toll and that seems like it’s going to tragically get much worse,"" Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist with Moody’s Analytics, told FOX Business.

An initial estimate by Moody’s Analytics of the damage caused by the wildfires puts the economic toll in a range of $3.5 billion to $7 billion. Of the total, about $3 billion to $6 billion is derived from property damage, while up to $1 billion of the total reflects lost output. Kamins said it represents a ""very significant economic shock locally"" to Maui’s roughly $10 billion economy.

MAUI HOTELS TO HOUSE DISPLACED FAMILIES, FIRST RESPONDERS AMID WILDFIRES

The economists arrived at that range based on preliminary estimates of structures and other property destroyed in the wildfire. Housing in Maui is relatively expensive, with median single-family home prices around $1 million, while a number of hotels, retail shops and other businesses were damaged or destroyed in the disaster.

When combined with the destruction of vehicles and other infrastructure, it brings the total estimated property damage above $3 billion. Kamins noted that the range is intended to be preliminary and added, ""It’s pretty wide for reason, and we expect that as details become clearer, and we have a better sense as insurance assessors go in that we’ll know with more precision what the number is.""

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC CO. FACING CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OVER MAUI FIRE

Kamins explained that for part of the lost output figures, Moody’s Analytics looked at the total output associated with a region and different industries based on assumptions about businesses being shuttered or forced to operate without power or things like cellular and internet service that could impact operations.

""The other part, in this case, was specifically looking at tourism because that is the lifeblood of the economy in Maui,"" Kamins said.

MAUI WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER SPEAKS OUT AS WILDFIRES LEAVE LOCAL INDUSTRY IN QUESTION: ‘GOING TO TAKE YEARS’

The tourism industry is the primary driver of Maui’s economy, as tourist-oriented businesses employ about 75% of Maui’s private sector jobs according to the Maui Economic Development Board. In the near term, the Hawaii Tourism Authority has asked non-essential visitors to depart the island and for any tourists planning trips to postpone their visit.

Lost output could have a tangible impact on economic activity in Hawaii, particularly in Maui, for Q3 and Q4 as losses accrue. Kamins said Maui’s ability to accommodate visitors will be limited in the coming weeks and months which could result in a decline in output of about 5% over the course of a year or 10% through the remainder of 2023.

Aside from tourism, Kamins noted that the logistics industry is a fairly significant driver of Maui’s economy through air cargo and seaports, while the agriculture sector also plays a notable role, although it is unclear to what degree businesses in those sectors have been affected by the disaster.

Apr 25 2023,Biden’s reelection likely to hinge on inflation and the economy,The Boston Globe,left,https://bostonglobe.com/2023/04/25/nation/bidens-reelection-likely-hinge-inflation-economy,"Despite record job creation, a historically low unemployment rate, and solid growth, perceptions of Biden’s handling of the economy may come down to a single number that is of outsized importance to American families: inflation, which continues to run well above normal. And although the pace of price growth is trending down from last year’s four-decade high, it remains elevated and the continued effort to tame it threatens to push the nation into a recession in an election year.

The nation’s economic health historically has been the pivotal factor in determining whether an incumbent president gets a second term, and Biden faces arguably his greatest challenge on that front.

WASHINGTON — In launching his reelection campaign Tuesday, President Biden said the country remains in a “battle for the soul of America.” But whether he gets another four years to win that fight will depend in great part on the heartbeat of the economy.

Republicans have blamed Biden for fast-rising prices of gas, groceries, rents, and other costs since he took office even though inflation is high across the world largely because of pandemic-related supply chain problems and the war in Ukraine. Inflation has been called “the cruelest tax” because it hits people every day. Since prices began shooting up in the spring of 2021, polls consistently have put Biden’s approval rating on the economy well below his overall anemic job approval.

“The number one thing that dictates the president’s approval rating is the economic numbers,” said Republican strategist Alex Conant. “If the economy is not healthy . . . it’s very difficult for a president to win reelection.”

Biden and his supporters clearly understand how important the economy is to winning another term.

Even before he released his announcement video Tuesday, Biden had been traveling the country in recent months touting his economic achievements. Those include more than 12 million new jobs created under his watch, a bipartisan infrastructure law that is funding thousands of projects nationwide, and legislation that reduces the cost of prescription drugs.

“Our economic plan is working. We now have to finish the job and there’s more to do,” Biden declared in a speech in Washington on Tuesday to a conference of North America’s Building Trades Unions. “Through our policies, the pace of inflation has been coming down now for nine months in a row with more to go.”

Republicans see high inflation as a major liability for the president, blaming what they call “Bidenflation” solely on increased government spending during his administration. The economy was the first thing former president Donald Trump focused on in a written statement before Biden’s reelection announcement, ahead of immigration, crime, and foreign policy.

“Thanks to Joe Biden’s socialist spending calamity, American families are being decimated by the worst inflation in half a century,” said Trump, the polling front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, warned that “inflation will continue to skyrocket” among other problems if Biden is reelected.

The annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index hit 9.1 percent last June, the highest since 1981, as increased COVID rescue spending combined with snarled global supply chains and a sharp increase in oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. The independent Federal Reserve has been aggressively raising interest rates to try to return price growth to normal levels.

That effort has been working — the annual consumer price index was down to 5 percent last month. But as the higher rates slow economic growth, they risk triggering a recession that would force people out of work during the presidential campaign.

A mild recession this year might not badly damage Biden’s reelection chances if the economy clearly is growing again and hiring picks up in the months before the election, analysts said. But a recession that lingers well into next year or doesn’t begin until then could be a major problem for Biden, said Allan Lichtman, a political historian at American University who has studied presidential campaigns.

“As Herbert Hoover once said, ’The president gets the credit for the sunshine and the blame for the rain,’ ‘‘ Lichtman said.

Lichtman said he has developed a system of 13 metrics that has correctly predicted the winner of every presidential election since 1984. Short-term and long-term economic performance by the party in power are two of them. And history has shown the negative impact a recession can have on a president’s reelection.

George H.W. Bush lost in 1992 as people were still struggling with the effects of a 1990-1991 recession despite his approval rating hitting 89 percent at the end of the Persian Gulf War. Conversely, an improving economy after a deep recession helped deliver a win for Ronald Reagan in 1984.

“For two or three years, Reagan’s approval ratings were abysmal . . . but luckily everything turned up in the election year,” Lichtman said.

Reagan’s approval rating hit a low of 35 percent in early 1983, according to the Gallup polling firm. He went on to win a landslide reelection as economic growth boomed. Biden’s approval rating was 40 percent last month, according to Gallup. His rating on the economy was 32 percent in the same poll, near the low point of his tenure.

Former labor secretary Martin J. Walsh, a close friend of Biden’s, thinks the president has delivered on the economy.

“Obviously there are issues in front of us like inflation that we still have to deal with and bring down,” said the former Boston mayor, who recently resigned from Biden’s Cabinet and attended the Tuesday speech after receiving an award from the building trades organization. “But when you talk about the job creation, getting people back to work, building the infrastructure of America . . . those are things that may not be front and center in everyone’s mind, but that’s what keeps America moving.”

Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg said it’s good that Biden has begun his campaign so he can address the economic attacks.

“He’s got to get his numbers up on the economy. He’s got to get his job approval numbers up. But those are doable things . . . particularly if you put a billion dollars in TV advertising behind it,” said Rosenberg, who correctly predicted that high inflation would not lead to a Republican wave in last year’s midterm elections because voters would reject the party’s extremism.

“When we tell our story about the economy, we know we can improve our standing,” he said. “I’d rather be us than them.”

Biden has already begun trying to make his case on the economy, as well as attacking Republicans on the issue. On Tuesday, he contrasted his “blue collar blueprint for rebuilding America” with what he called the Republican “trickle down” economic strategy focused on lower taxes for the wealthy.

“Folks, trickle down economics doesn’t work,” Biden told the building trades group. “We have a very different plan for the economy. . . . We’re turning things around and we’re doing it in a big way.”

Conant acknowledged that the economy is in pretty good shape right now and inflation is trending in the right direction. But voters will make decisions based on their individual circumstances. And Biden will get the blame if people feel they are worse off regardless of the economic data, Conant said.

“The old joke is, a recession is when your neighbor loses a job and a depression is when you lose your job. . . . High gas prices, inflation, rising unemployment all hit consumers very hard and become huge political liabilities,” Conant said. “Voters are going to punish the White House if they feel that the economic situation is hurting them.”

Sep 05 2023,Hawaii residents fly to Maui to support the island’s struggling economy following fires,Hawaii News Now,center,https://hawaiinewsnow.com/2023/09/05/hawaii-residents-fly-maui-support-islands-struggling-economy-following-fires,"HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Maui businesses reported an economic boost from kamaaina this Labor Day.

Businesses said the boost started Saturday as the island continues to see a dip in visitors from the mainland.

The staycation boost comes amid renewed efforts to encourage more people to visit Maui.

“Support the economy, and we just ate a lot of food and drove around the island,” said Connor Kawate, who took a day trip Sunday to Maui with his mom.

Another factor is cheaper than usual inter-island flights on Hawaiian and Southwest airlines.

Rental car workers at the Kahului Airport said most of their customers this Labor Day weekend were Hawaii residents, making it the busiest few days since the fires.

Still, hundreds of cars sat idle in parking lots outside the airport.

According to state data, the island averaged 7,000 daily domestic visitors before the fires. This past Thursday, the island hit 3,000 visitors. Two weeks ago, it was lingering under 2,000.

“After the fire, it was almost an immediate drop-off,” said Nathaniel Emerson, with Da Nani Pirates food truck in Kahului.

Business owners say the weekend boost is noticed — and appreciated.

“Looking at the numbers, about a 25% increase to how it’s been the past three or four weeks,” said Emerson.

Oct 30 2023,Annual Arkansas Poll shows economy biggest concern; Sanders sees highest disapproval for governor in survey’s history,KARK,center,https://kark.com/news/politics/annual-arkansas-poll-shows-economy-biggest-concern-sanders-sees-highest-disapproval-for-governor-in-surveys-history,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – The annual Arkansas Poll was released Monday, showing the economy to be the top concern of many Natural State Residents while showing growing disapproval to how elected officials are operating.

The poll, complied by the University of Arkansas Department of Political Science, showed 36% of respondents said the economy was the most important issue facing the state, down 3% from the prio year’s survey.

Politicians or politics in general was a distant second on the list, being seen as the most important issue by 14% of respondents.

While politicians were not seen high as the top issue in the state, respondents were harsh in their evaluations of many Arkansas lawmakers.

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders saw a 39% disapproval rating against a 48% approval rating. That disapproval rating was the highest for an Arkansas governor in the 25-year history of the poll, breaking the previous mark of 38% given to then-Gov. Mike Huckabee, Sanders’ father, in 2003.

As for the state’s top officials in Washington, Sen. John Boozman’s disapproval rating was up to 38%, its highest ever, while his approval rating held fairly steady at a 40%, the same as when he entered office in 2011.

Sen. Tom Cotton saw a 44% disapproval against a 42% approval rating, marking a fairly minor decline in approval but a sharp increase in disapproval since his taking office in 2015.

While the Arkansas leaders saw close numbers in approval and disapproval, Natural State residents had very low ratings for President Joe Biden, whose 63% disapproval has remained constant since he took office.

While Arkansans had differing issues on lawmakers, there were some bright spots in how they thought government operated. The survey showed the highest positive results for public libraries and parks & recreation services, with 83% of those surveyed saying they were satisfied or very satisfied with both categories.

Respondents gave relatively high marks for police protection, with 78% saying they were satisfied or very satisfied. Health and hospital services were also positive, with 64% satisfied or very satisfied.

The least satisfactory was the public welfare system, with 53% voting they were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied. The K-through-12 public schools also received a low rating at 47% satisfied or very satisfied, though colleges and universities score higher at a 78% positive rate.

The politics of the state voters showed 33% thought of themselves as Republicans versus 25% who considered themselves Democrats, almost an inverse of when polling began in 1999. The largest group classified themselves as independent voters, at 34%. Of those independent voters, 44% thought they were closer to Republicans.

For political beliefs, however, 47% of respondents felt they were conservative, versus 17% who were liberal and 29% who answered moderate.

Against that conservativism, however, 38% felt abortions should be easier to get in the state, compared to 25% who thought the laws should be unchanged and 29% who felt they should be more difficult.

On guns, 40% of voters thought gun laws should be stricter, 39% who thought they should not change and 19% who felt they should be less strict.

In a release, University of Arkansas political science professor and poll director Janine Parry noted that recent years have seen the number of state residents who feel the Natural State is heading in “the wrong direction” has climbed to one in three.

“A volatile economic and political environment is likely influencing some people’s general sense of well-being, in Arkansas and elsewhere,” Parry said.

Apr 14 2020,Reopening the Economy,The Flip Side,not rated,https://www.theflipside.io/archives/reopening-the-economy,"From the Left

The left focuses on the challenges that must be overcome in order to reopen the economy.

“[Trump] pretends there is a switch and that he alone can flick it, but of course no such thing exists. This crisis is not all about him. It’s all about us. For one thing, Trump is not the one who decided to shut everything down: He never issued a nationwide stay-at-home order. We are sequestered and socially distanced because our governors and mayors told us we needed to be. And we continue housebound, wearing masks when we infrequently venture outside and dutifully scrubbing our hands when we return, because we understand the need to protect our health and that of others. I’d love it if everything suddenly went back to normal. But I know that isn’t possible…



“Would you feel safe on a crowded bus, commuter train or subway car? What about in a carpool: How would you feel if someone in the back seat were to cough? If you work in retail, how would you interact with customers? At arm’s length, wearing a mask and gloves?… Our lives will reboot gradually, perhaps haltingly, and it doesn’t matter how frantically Trump pushes the ‘on’ button.”

Eugene Robinson, Washington Post

“Everything we see in the polling data suggests that almost no one thinks that we need to reopen the economy right now. In a Fox News poll this week, 80% of voters nationwide say they would favor the federal government announcing a stay at home order for everybody but essential workers. You usually can't get 80% of voters to agree upon anything, and the 80% is certainly higher than the approval Trump is getting for his handling of the coronavirus. Voters aren't concerned Trump is being too proactive. If anything, they think he is being too cautious. The same Fox News poll showed that a mere 4% of voters thought Trump was overreacting to the virus. That compares with 47% who think he isn't taking the virus seriously enough…



“The point is that there's a lot in the data to indicate that Americans want the President to focus most on the public health issue at hand more so than they are worried about him fixing the economy right now. If people are allowed to go about their normal routine too soon and the number of coronavirus cases rise afterward, there's a good case to be made that's far more dangerous to Trump's reelection chances than a bad economy.”

“In different ways, all [the plans put forth so far] say the same thing: Even if you can imagine the herculean political, social, and economic changes necessary to manage our way through this crisis effectively, there is no normal for the foreseeable future. Until there’s a vaccine, the United States either needs economically ruinous levels of social distancing, a digital surveillance state of shocking size and scope, or a mass testing apparatus of even more shocking size and intrusiveness.”

Ezra Klein, Vox

“To truly end the crisis, keep deaths low, and allow the economy to recover, testing has to happen on an enormous scale. How enormous?… One of the lower-end benchmarks estimates the US will need 750,000 tests per week. The high-end proposal, from Nobel laureate economist Paul Romer, starts at 22 million tests per day and goes up. And not just one test per person, but repeated testing over time… Getting to 35 million tests per day would cost around $100 billion, according to Romer. It’s a steep price tag, but a fraction of the $350 billion or so in monthly economic losses due to the ongoing lockdowns… half-measures will only prolong the problem. Go big or stay home.”

Jun 28 2023,Biden touts 'Bidenomics' despite terrible poll numbers on the economy,Fox Business,right,https://foxbusiness.com/politics/biden-touts-bidenomics-despite-terrible-poll-numbers-economy,"President Biden touted his ""Bidenomics"" policies despite polls showing that Americans have very little confidence in his ability to steer the U.S. economy on Wednesday.

As of late May, some 83% of voters say the economy is in only fair or poor shape. That stat is worse by 14 points than when Biden first entered office in April 2021, when just 69% thought the same. Critically, just 20% of Americans say they believe Biden's policies are helping them.

Nevertheless, Biden assumed a confident tone during an economic address in Chicago on Wednesday, blaming conservatives for ""40 years of Republican trickle-down economics that helped few, but hurt the middle class.""

""It's going to take some time,"" Biden said. ""I'm not here to declare victory on the economy. I'm here to say, we have a plan that is turning things around incredibly quickly. We have more work to do.""

""When I took office, the pandemic was raging and our economy was reeling. Supply chains are broken, millions of people unemployed, hundreds of thousands of small businesses on the verge of closing after so many had already closed. Literally hundreds of thousands on the verge of closing. Today, the US has the highest economic growth rate, leading the world economy since the pandemic, the highest in the world,"" he added.

Biden said the turnaround was ""no accident"" and chalked it up to ""Bidenomics in action.""

""Bidenomics is just another way of saying restore the American dream because it worked before. It's rooted in what we've always worked best at in this country, investing in America, investing in Americans. Because when we invest in our people, we strengthen the middle class,"" Biden said.

Biden went on to claim he has created more jobs in two years than any other president has in their four-year term.

The president's Twitter account previewed the claim in a post earlier Wednesday that led to widespread backlash from users pointing out that a huge portion of the job creation during Biden’s term was the return of jobs lost to coronavirus lockdown measures.

As of late May, 42% of Americans approved of Biden’s overall job performance, while 58% disapproved. That was down from 44% and 55% in April and the lowest since August 2022, when it was also 42% and 58%. His worst was 40% and 59% in July 2022.

Or, with politicians newly willing to spend, it could build a carbon-neutral, significantly stronger and fairer society—and put millions to work doing it… Before the immediate mobilization around World War II, the years leading up to it saw federal jobs programs employ millions in work the private sector simply didn’t see as important enough to create… “ Full employment was an animating demand of social movements through much of the postwar era, which led to it being featured in the Democratic Party platform until 1980… Thinking creatively in such a dire crisis—about silver linings and opportunities—can feel inappropriate, even irresponsible… [But] How lawmakers respond to Covid-19 and its economic fallout could either protect the next century from the persistent crises threatened by rising temperatures, or make them far worse.” Kate Aronoff, New Republic

“ Governments should directly assume the debt of high-risk households . Trying to incentivise financial intermediaries to modify the terms of existing loans, as the US government did with the Home Affordable Modification Program after the 2008 crisis, will be too slow to meet the current challenge. It’s often said that the public health of the majority is determined by the most vulnerable in society. The same logic applies to a healthy political and economic system: its stability depends on how it treats its weakest members. Hedging our bets on an economic system that has neglected these truths and instead prioritised wealth creation at the top has put us all at risk.” Katharina Pistor, The Guardian

“Unless a business has been forced to fully close, there’s a way to keep workers on the payroll , ease the pain of a downturn and speed economic recovery. It’s called ‘work-sharing.’… Employers experiencing a temporary reduction in business agree to cut employees’ hours instead of laying off workers entirely. Employees on reduced hours receive unemployment benefits in proportion to the reduction in their hours. Businesses benefit by retaining valued employees and avoiding recruitment and training costs when economic conditions return to normal. Workers benefit by retaining most of their income and access to health insurance — a critical factor in a public health-triggered economic crisis like this one.” Katharine G. Abraham and Susan N. Housman, Politico

“President Trump has asked for aid to the airlines, which have already taken a huge hit. In practice, this would mean bailing out their shareholders. Here’s why I’m not terribly sympathetic to this idea: Airlines have access to major capital markets. They have managed to continue operations through many, many rounds of bankruptcies before, with little noticeable effect for customers or the rest of the economy… “The same is not generally true for millions of small- and medium-sized companies — which are more likely to go out of business altogether, and take with them all the jobs on their payrolls. Compared to their larger counterparts, smaller businesses tend to operate on thinner margins and with smaller cash reserves… Just as lawmakers are leaning toward direct payments rather than loans to households, they might consider giving grants of some kind to businesses , too.” Catherine Rampell, Washington Post

“ Has there ever been a sudden stop comparable to this ?... The Great Depression, which began after the stock market crashed in October, 1929, was wrenching and disastrous, of course. But [economics professor Barry] Eichengreen pointed out that it developed more gradually than the coronavirus shock. ‘The production of goods and services fell by about a third, but over a period of three-plus years,’ he said. ‘Industrial production fell by half, but, again, over a period of three years. The unemployment rate rose to about one in four, but over four years. Now what we are talking about is the possibility that the unemployment rate could shoot up very dramatically in a very short period of time.’” John Cassidy, New Yorker

“The central goal of policy should be to keep businesses alive so they are ready to turn back on again [when the pandemic ends]. They must be able to keep rather than fire employees, to call them back quickly, and to help those employees pay bills and keep their health insurance… [but] not even the U.S. government has infinite resources. Its unique ability to borrow even when nobody else can borrow, and to promise eventual repayment by taxation, is a treasured but finite resource. When a crisis comes in which even the Treasury can’t borrow, we are in for a true catastrophe…



“Lending is better than transfers. Since loans must be paid back, larger amounts can go where needed. Small Business Administration loans are a good start. But most business and most employment is large business. Large firms are often even more cash-poor and in hock to nervous creditors, and they are harder to replace or revive if they fail. Lend with the head, not the heart. ‘People’ might seem more worthy than ‘corporations,’ but we need corporations to hire people when it’s over.”

“We are intentionally turning the economy off to save lives and protect our future, but if we want any shot to turn that economy back on in three to six months, we’re going to need to make sure the small and mid-sized businesses that form our middle class and civil society’s spine are still there… Congress must authorize the [Small Business Administration] to take on a Federal Emergency Management Agency-like role, cutting checks and providing direct infusions to small and mid-sized businesses. The process must be streamlined, with discretion given to the administrator (or a federal corona czar) to oversee and move the machinery along.”

“If people can’t go out to a restaurant to spend the extra money from their government stimulus check or payroll-tax cut because they’re quarantined or sick, municipal tax revenue will plummet. Cities and states may not even be able to sell debt (the municipal bond market is already signaling this) to pay their bills and workers. New York City and state are already projecting steep drops in revenue for the coming year. The federal government should be in discussions with governors to see if state and local governments need a Wall Street-like bailout to get through a possible liquidity crisis until the virus panic blows over, people start spending money again and tax revenues recover.”

“Americans have been urged to ‘social distance’ and those who may have been exposed to the coronavirus to self-quarantine. A decade ago this would have been unpleasant but also impractical for most people. Fortunately, there’s now an app, or many, many apps, for that… These apps now let customers order rides, groceries and food delivery through their smartphones…



“This week [Amazon] announced it would hire 100,000 workers to meet increasing demand for grocery and other online orders. This may provide work alternatives for Americans laid off in airlines, hospitality and other industries affected by the coronavirus. It is also raising its starting wage for workers at its fulfillment centers to $17 an hour from $15. Workers can also quickly sign up for work on multiple apps and schedule their hours around when they must take care of kids at home. Progressives criticize this ‘on-demand’ work as somehow exploitative. But the coronavirus contagion is demonstrating that this free-market flexibility can be a labor lifesaver in a viral panic.”

The coronavirus, [author and Open Markets Institute fellow Matt Stoller] argues, is making the argument for antitrust — single sources of supply for all kinds of suddenly essential medical needs are leading to shortages and could cause huge price jumps. In other words, the coronavirus is exposing a major foundational myth at the heart of Chicago School thinking: that efficiency, maximalist free trade policy, and the consumer welfare standard are stable systems. All lead to short term profits and long term risk. We should replace those with a more diverse and stable set of economic values: redundancy in supply chains, diversity in production locations, productive capacity, and universal programs… “‘It’s not just tweaking trade policy, or doing some antitrust, or doing some federal spending. You need all of the above. You need another New Deal.’” Zephyr Teachout, Jacobin Magazine

“Nothing says ‘Don’t panic’ quite like an emergency interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve… The problem is, it’s really hard to tell from Powell’s comments exactly what motivated the cut , why the Open Market Committee decided to cut by half a percentage point instead of the usual quarter, how the rate cut is expected to ameliorate the situation, and how this meshes with the Fed’s statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and keep prices stable. The lack of clarity just makes it harder for people to decide which signals from Washington and the media to follow — the ones telling them to freak out, or the ones telling them not to?” Jon Healey, Los Angeles Times

Others, however, point out that “Before [last week’s] rate cut, the Fed only had around 1.5 percent [of ammunition], leaving far less room to cut [than in 2000]. And the Fed’s counterparts abroad are in even worse shape: short-term interest rates in Europe are actually negative, so the European Central Bank has basically no room at all to cut further… When it comes to the underlying economics, we know two things. First, the coronavirus is looking more and more like a serious blow to the economy. Second… the Fed and its counterparts don’t have much room to respond . I’ve been saying for a while that I didn’t know when the economy would next face a serious bump in the road, but I did know that our shock absorbers were pretty much shot. Well, here comes the bump. Brace yourself.” Paul Krugman, New York Times

“Many observers have emphasized the adverse impact of the virus on supply (especially in the global chains that play such a crucial role in manufacturing). The shock obviously has a supply element. But it seems clear that much of the impact of the virus is in the form of uncertainty, as households and businesses struggle with the question of where the disease will hit next, and how bad it will be when it does hit. This uncertainty is a drag on demand in the many communities throughout the country and world that have no cases of the virus. But that drag can be offset, as usual, by stimulus from the Fed and other policy makers … “Given the demand nature of the shock, the Fed can and should do more when it meets again in a couple of weeks… [And] Congress has to step up to show its willingness to systematically insulate the economy against aggregate demand shocks by, for example, using a combination of tax cuts and increases in infrastructure spending. Without a much clearer strategic commitment to fiscal policy support of the economy, we can expect further declines in long-run expectations about growth and inflation — and that will make the current aggregate demand shortfall even worse.” Narayana Kocherlakota, Bloomberg

“Silicon Valley’s top investing firm has a stark message on coronavirus: prepare for the worst… Calling coronavirus ‘the black swan of 2020,’ Sequoia predicted that the global economy could be dislodged by the virus, and the firm told its portfolio companies, ‘We suggest you question every assumption about your business’… Specifically, Sequoia is telling its founders to question how much cash it has before running out of money ‘to avoid potentially painful future consequences.’” Theodore Schleifer, Vox

“[The International Air Transport Association] is now predicting that, globally, [airline] carriers will lose between $63 billion and $113 billion in passenger revenue this year… declines in travel are a pretty reliable leading indicator that a downturn is on the way. It’s a sign that something is wrong (in this case, an almost-pandemic that’s keeping people home). And when people don’t fly, they don’t spend money on hotels, or rental cars, or restaurants in destination cities either, which deepens any economic pain.” Jordan Weissmann, Slate

“The jobs survey was taken in the middle of February, before coronavirus fears overtook Corporate America… Even though the US economy appears in good shape to absorb the shock the coronavirus outbreak is dealing to economies around the world, the jobs report -- like most economic data -- is backward-looking and doesn't allow a real-time assessment of the economy . So it might be time to pay more attention to shorter term employment data like weekly initial jobless claims going forward, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.” Anneken Tappe, CNN

“There’s a lot of speculation that the coronavirus outbreak will hurt the U.S. economy. That could be, but it would have to be a massive hit to even put a dent in the robust labor market. February’s jobs report is simply stunning. Normally, job growth slows at the end of an economic expansion. But that’s not the case 10 years after the recovery from the Great Recession began. Unemployment remained near 50-year lows, and wage growth continued to exceed inflation…



“Economists have been concerned about slowdowns for well over a year. Trump’s trade conflict with China was the primary culprit. Time and again, we heard experts say the trade war would impact the American economy any day now. Some sectors certainly were damaged, but the overall economy kept right on moving. The coronavirus effect might be different, but then again, it might not… right now, the economic data are as good as they can get for Trump.”

Henry Olsen, Washington Post

“The contrast between economic past and future has rarely been more stark than it was this week as the coronavirus panic contrasted with what has been a strong underlying economy… The best economic policy stimulus in this case is a successful public-health response that reduces the spread of disease. The economy will be poised to bounce back…



“Even if the good jobs news is backward looking, it still shouldn’t be dismissed. It means the real economy had a strong foundation to withstand the coronavirus impact. Construction added 42,000 jobs in the month, following 49,000 in January, as the housing market continues to pick up steam after a two-year slowdown. Lower mortgage interest rates should encourage more home buying, which will help growth even if business spending falls.”

According to the CBO, which based its forecast on the assumption that the economic policies of the Obama administration remained in place, the economy should have created only 2 million new jobs by this point. The actual number: 6.9 million. GDP growth has outpaced the CBO’s prediction in each of the past three years, resulting in an economy that is $600 billion bigger than it was supposed to be.”

Regarding the rate cut, some argue that “The problem with the coronavirus isn't a capital or credit crunch, but a material supply shock. The coronavirus has disrupted the global supply chain, first with the quarantining (both mandatory and self-imposed, of workers producing intermediate goods), and soon, in domestic markets worldwide. A vaccine could cure that problem. A rate cut won't…



“For far too long, the Fed has irresponsibly cut rates in times of stable growth, thus sabotaging the traditional monetary policy tools that are intended to stimulate the economy in the case of an actual recession. Whereas the Fed could slash rates from more than 5% during the 2008 crisis, rates today are at less than 2%, even as unemployment continues to hover near half-century lows and growth and markets have remained (outside of this recent panic) relatively consistent.”

Tiana Lowe, Washington Examiner

“The half-a-point cut brought the rates at which banks can borrow from each other down to 1.25 percent, a rate that would indicate an economy already in deep recession and in need of a rescue. But it didn’t ‘work,’ in that the stock market continued to fall. By the end of the week, the Dow had shed another 1,200 points…



“A cut in interest rates is supposed to spur companies and people to borrow money and spend it. Mortgage rates are now at their lowest rate ever, just above 3 percent. But companies aren’t going to make big investments when their supply chains are broken. Drugmakers and toymakers alike can’t sell to the American consumer when Chinese workers can’t get to work to make the drugs and the toys. An interest-rate cut isn’t going to spur you to take that spontaneous trip to Italy right now. And if you are worried that the virus will cause you to miss work, you are unlikely to buy a house.”

Jul 27 2023,U.S. economy grew by annual rate of 2.4 percent in second quarter,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/07/27/gdp-q2-2023-economy/,"The storm clouds that threatened the economy under President Biden are lifting with surprising speed, as fears of an imminent recession abate just as inflation cools. On Thursday, the government reported that the economy grew last quarter by 2.4 percent on an annualized basis — a faster-than-expected clip that bolstered confidence the United States is not about to slide into recession.

The report follows a steep drop in inflation, from 9 percent last year to 3 percent in the most recent report, and a measurable brightening in consumer attitudes. Positive news is emerging across the data: Worker pay is rising faster than prices, consumer spending remains robust, and new federal investments in infrastructure and clean energy are bolstering the overall economy. The Biden administration resolved a standoff over the debt ceiling with House Republicans, and its emergency interventions helped calm a crisis among regional banks. A deal this week between UPS and its union removed one more potential challenge to the economy.

This string of positive developments could reshape a political landscape that for more than two years has been defined by Republican accusations that Biden is mismanaging the economy. Although quick to emphasize the progress is fragile, Democratic policymakers are newly eager to boast of the strength in what has been perhaps Biden’s greatest political liability.

“This progress wasn’t inevitable or accidental — it is Bidenomics in action,” Biden said in a statement touting the economic growth numbers. “My economic plan is working — and we’re just getting started.”

Released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the new gross domestic product figures showed the economy expanded for the fourth straight quarter in a row, casting doubt on predictions of a recession this year.

While some economists had predicted a slowdown in the quarter between April and June, growth accelerated instead. Federal Reserve staffers, who a few months ago had worried about a “mild” recession, are no longer forecasting one. Major Wall Street banks are saying it looks increasingly likely that the economy can stave off a recession, at least until next year. The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits dropped to the lowest level in five months for the week ending July 22.

“It seems the administration has been validated in that inflation is coming down while the economy is doing well,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell University. “This looks like it’s going to be a big political win.”

To be sure, major risks remain. Many economists say the economy is still running too hot. That could mean the central bank has to keep borrowing costs elevated for longer, which could trigger a downturn and lead to higher unemployment. The risk of a partial or complete federal government shutdown this fall seems to be rising, which could complicate the notion that all is moving in the right direction in Washington.

The Federal Reserve has already raised interest rates to their highest level in 22 years, and it could take time for those hikes to filter through to the broader economy. There are growing signs that the moves are beginning to have an impact. The housing market has slowed sharply in the past year, manufacturing is down, and employers are posting fewer jobs. Households, which until recently had been splurging on travel and big-ticket items, are also becoming more cautious with their money. Some signs of deprivation for the poor are also rising: Food banks and advocates are reporting substantial increases in the number of hungry Americans, while many cities have reported increases in their homeless populations.

Consumer spending jumped by 4.2 percent at the beginning of the year but has moderated since then, rising by 1.6 percent in the most recent quarter. Gas prices also ticked up this week.

“The economy has remarkably avoided a recession,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. “That’s put the Fed in a nice position; it’s emboldened them to really go all in against inflation. But the question is: How long can this strength persist? Are there still effects from higher interest rates that we haven’t seen yet?”

But any emerging trepidation among consumers is largely being offset by a burst of new spending by the government and businesses. For example, the Biden administration’s robust investment in infrastructure projects such as new bridges and roads, airport improvements, and manufacturing plants for electric vehicles appears to be spurring widespread private investments and boosting the overall economy far earlier than many had predicted.

Business investments in infrastructure, including manufacturing plants and transportation equipment, rose by 56 percent in the most recent quarter, accounting for more than a third of overall economic growth.

Morgan Stanley last week made a “sizable upward revision” to its GDP expectations for the year — raising its annual forecast threefold, from 0.4 percent to 1.3 percent — citing ongoing federal investments.

“The economy in the first half of the year is growing much stronger than we had anticipated,” Ellen Zentner, chief U.S. economist for Morgan Stanley, wrote in a research note last week. “The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act … is driving a boom in large-scale infrastructure.”

The Biden administration has so far allocated $299 billion in infrastructure funding for projects across the United States. Private companies have announced another $503 billion in related investments, White House data shows. More money from Washington is on the way.

In Beaverton, Ore., Tina Adams’s engineering firm expects a 25 percent increase in revenue this year, which she attributes to a flurry of new government-backed infrastructure projects. She has added three new engineers to her workforce of 10 to keep up, and she says the boom in federal work has more than made up for stalling local projects.

“I can say with a straight face that of 25 contracts and projects we have, almost all of those — 23 of them — are federally funded in some way,” said Adams, founder of Casso Consulting. “These are short-term jobs, but they have very long-lasting effects. We are looking down the barrel of a whole lot more work opportunities.”

Adams’s firm, which specializes in public works designs, is among the first to benefit from the burst of federal funding. She and her staff of engineers are already laying out drainage routes and utility relocations for a number of large-scale projects: replacing bridges, widening highways, creating bike lanes and adding wheelchair ramps to sidewalks.

“It’s already had a direct impact and created an environment where we could hire more people and work on more projects,” Adams said. “But this is just the first step. There’s a whole lot more coming down the pipeline.”

Some experts are skeptical of the degree to which these investments are boosting the overall economy.

Jason Furman, a former Obama administration economist, said that “manufacturing structures” — the part of the economy booming in large part because of Biden’s policies — only represent about 2 percent of total investment, and a much smaller part of the nation’s overall economy.

Furman had predicted that lowering inflation to 2 percent — the Federal Reserve’s target number — would require an unemployment rate that rose to 6.5 percent. With inflation still significantly above that number by the Fed’s preferred metric, he said, that prediction has not yet been proved incorrect.

“I’m not saying I’m right or wrong, but literally nothing in the data would cause you to revise your view,” Furman said. “We are in a better place than we were a year ago, but that forecast has not been disproven.”

And yet for now at least, the public appears to be happier about the direction of the economy. Two widely watched indicators of how consumers are feeling have risen substantially this summer. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, who worked on Biden’s 2020 campaign, said she is beginning to see a turn in her focus groups as well, after years of pessimism fueled by inflation."

But what leaps out to me is how much this pessimism has spread even to less partisan figures who typically are afforded more benefit of the doubt, even under unpopular presidents during trying economic times.

AD

The latest Gallup poll found respondents have less confidence in Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who was appointed by Donald Trump and re-appointed by Biden, than any recent predecessor going back 20 years. 36% have a great/fair amount of confidence in his decisions, while the 28% who have “almost none” is the highest ever recorded by a full five points.

It’s the same story with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen: The 31% who say they have almost no confidence in her performance is the highest of any recent person to hold the post by a significant margin. That includes Trump’s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin during pandemic job losses, and Jack Lew and Tim Geithner under President Obama during the long and painful recovery from the Great Recession.

For both Powell and Yellen, anywhere from two to three times as many respondents typically registered “no opinion” when asked about their predecessors, suggesting the public is more tuned in now to their performance and more likely to have a strong position."
May 10 2023,Inflation declined to 4.9% in April in encouraging sign for economy,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/inflation-april-consumer-price-index,"Inflation cooled slightly to 4.9% for the year ending in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday, a welcome sign that the Federal Reserve‘s efforts to tame price growth are working.

The much-anticipated numbers from the consumer price index show that, while inflation is much too high, it is falling in response to the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes, the most recent of which came last week.



HOW THE DOMINOES WILL FALL IF THE WORST HAPPENS WITH THE DEBT CEILING



Inflation had been running at 5% the month before. Tuesday’s report marks 10 straight months of declines in annual inflation after the rate peaked at a whopping 9.1% in June. Prices overall grew by 0.4 percentage points between March and April (as opposed to an annual basis), according to the index.

Meanwhile, “core inflation,” which strips out volatile food and energy prices, ticked down a tenth of a percentage point to 5.5% for the year ending in April.

“Consumer prices rose as expected in April, leaving inflation still well above its pre-pandemic trend,” Oxford Economics wrote in an analysis of Wednesday’s report. “We expect to receive more encouraging news on the inflation front as the economy cools though we won’t reach the Fed’s 2% inflation target for quite some time.”

Soaring inflation has buffeted households over the past two years and undercut support for President Joe Biden and his agenda. Republicans have blamed the high inflation on the administration’s spending measures.

The higher prices are hitting consumers hard. The rising cost of food, in particular, has been difficult for many households. The price of bread has risen 12.6% over the last year, while dairy products have increased in price by 8%.

While some energy products, such as gasoline, rose on a month-to-month basis, many items were down heavily from the year before. Regular unleaded gasoline fell 12.4% on an annual basis, while fuel oil dropped more than 20%.

The Fed has been working to lower inflation through revisions to its target rate. The Fed just conducted its 10th consecutive rate hike this month, driving the target range between 5% and 5.25%.

The Wednesday report also comes against the backdrop of tumult in the banking system.

The upheaval began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and has since extended to other regional banks. Economists fear that banks could curtail lending, delivering a further hit to the economy. The “tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently said.

Both the persistent inflation and the collapse of SVB have raised recession fears.

The New York Fed’s probability modeling indicates a nearly 58% chance of recession in the next 12 months.

Fed staff themselves predicted a mild recession in a presentation to central bank officials at the Federal Open Market Committee’s March meeting, minutes from the meeting recently revealed.

Still, the labor market has remained surprisingly resilient in the face of the rate increases.

The economy exceeded expectations in April and added 253,000 jobs. The headline number was higher than predicted, and the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, tied for the lowest such rate since 1969."
May 07 2023,Writers’ strike: Has the gig economy come for Hollywood?,Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/2023/0505/Writers-strike-Has-the-gig-economy-come-for-Hollywood,"“I do think that’s something that anyone in America can kind of understand, especially as we all are kind of finding ourselves in a gig economy to some extent,” says Eli Bauman, a writer for award shows such as the Emmys. “All we’re asking for is some version of sustainability and stability and respect.”

How could peak TV – a record 599 original scripted shows aired in the United States last year – lead to fewer jobs? Writers say they’ve been shortchanged by the streaming model. For starters, a season typically only consists of eight to 10 episodes, rather than 22.

How much are writers worth? For studios, the answer may be a financial calculation. For writers, that question isn’t just a monetary one. It’s also a matter of feeling seen and valued.

The first writers’ strike in 15 years followed a breakdown in talks between the Writers Guild of America and The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The standoff revolves around financial compensation and job security in an era when streaming has reshaped Hollywood.

Outside Amazon’s film and television division here at Culver Studios, protesters wearing sunglasses and “Writers Guild of America” T-shirts chant “union power” in front of the colonial-style building where “Gone with the Wind” was filmed. These writers claim that studios are turning their profession into a gig economy consisting of short-term jobs with low pay and even uncompensated work. As one striker’s sign puts it, “Hey Amazon, free delivery is your job, not ours!”

From a distance, it sounds like a street party. Outside one of Hollywood’s oldest studios, people are cheering. A speaker blares Stevie Wonder’s “Living for the City.” Passing cars toot appreciative horns.

Up close, it becomes apparent this isn’t a party. It’s a picket line. When screenwriters across America went on strike on Tuesday, they started marshaling outside entertainment headquarters such as Amazon’s film and television division here at Culver Studios. The upbeat protesters, wearing sunglasses and “Writers Guild of America” T-shirts, chant “union power” while parading around the colonial-style building where “Gone with the Wind” was filmed. These writers claim that studios are turning their profession into a gig economy consisting of short-term jobs with low pay and even uncompensated work. As one striker’s sign puts it, “Hey Amazon, free delivery is your job, not ours!”

“What’s happening right now is just abject disrespect of writers,” says K.C. Scott, a scribe on the Apple TV+ show “Physical,” whose boombox is playing Bob Marley & The Wailers’ “Get Up, Stand Up.” “When I was starting my career, someone said, ‘You go to New York as a writer if you want respect. You go to LA if you want money.’ And, right now, we’re not getting either.”

Why We Wrote This A story focused on Respect How much are writers worth? For studios, the answer may be a financial calculation. For writers, that question isn’t just a monetary one. It’s also a matter of feeling seen and valued.

The first writers’ strike in 15 years followed a breakdown in talks between the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). The standoff revolves around financial compensation and job security in an era when streaming has reshaped Hollywood. In a document released Thursday, the AMPTP disputed the accuracy of WGA’s “gig economy” claims and also touted a proposed contract that includes “the highest first-year increase offered to the WGA in more than 25 years.”

The negotiations come down to an all-too-familiar dispute in Hollywood: How much are writers worth? For studios, the answer may be a financial calculation. For writers, that question isn’t just a monetary one. It’s also a matter of feeling seen and valued.

“Writers are seen as the essential cog in the wheel,” says Dominic Patten, senior editor at Deadline Hollywood, an industry news publication. “But I think that what’s happened in recent years, it’s more systematic and institutional. … We’ve seen a change, especially with the advent of streaming, in the way that the entire system works.”

The last time writers went on strike was for 100 days that spanned 2007 and 2008. The toll on California’s economy is estimated to have been $2.1 billion.

Stephen Humphries/The Christian Science Monitor View caption Hide caption Britt Matt and K.C. Scott stand outside Amazon Studios in Culver City, California, on May 3. Mr. Scott believes that Hollywood undervalues its writers.

Fragmented audiences, fragmented pay?

Back then, audiences were already fragmenting as entertainment options expanded, but mainstream media was still relatively ... mainstream. Successful movie script writers could expect bonanza paydays in an era in which studios released major competing films every weekend. Established writers on a network or cable TV show could make a good living over the course of a 22-episode season. If a series was reincarnated on DVD or TV syndication, there were additional residual payments.

Today, three of the TV writers picketing outside Culver Studios say that was something of a golden era.

“It was just 10 years ago that we were all entry-level writers and we got a job that could sustain us for that year, even on a show that got canceled,” says Eli Bauman, a writer for award shows such as the Emmys, standing alongside his wife, Joanna Calo (“The Bear”), and their longtime friend Raphael Bob-Waksberg (“Bojack Horseman”).

In 2007, streaming was barely a twinkling pixel in the eye of big tech companies. Apple had only just unveiled the iPhone. Netflix, a mail-delivery DVD service, had only just launched video. Amazon’s focus was selling Kindles and fresh groceries, on demand.

Then in 2013, Netflix televised a revolution by erecting “House of Cards,” its first original show.

Within a decade, the company pioneered a process of more creative destruction than an episode of “Squid Game.” In the race to maximize content, streaming competitors have acquired and consolidated vaults such as MGM, and even whole studios such as 20th Century Fox. The shift to streaming has boosted the number of new Hollywood productions. Last year, a record 599 original scripted shows aired in the United States. The beneficiaries of that boom aren’t just stockholders, but also the production crew workers such as casting agents, set designers, hair-and-makeup artists, electricians, cinematographers, VFX artists, and even the assistants tasked with fetching kombucha lattes for the directors.

But writers say they’ve been short-changed by the new business model. For starters, on streaming shows, a season typically only consists of eight to 10 episodes.

“It’s a paradox because you would think with so many more shows, there’d be more jobs for writers,” says Jessica Sharzer, a screen captain at the WGA, in a phone interview. “The writers’ rooms literally shrunk. So they used to have, let’s say … 10 writers in them, now they have six.”

Most concerning, Ms. Sharzer says, is a widespread phenomenon dubbed “mini rooms.” If a production entity likes a pilot script, it may give a showrunner a minimal budget to hire two or three additional writers to develop the show. If the show doesn’t end up in development, it’s not a big loss for the company. But the writers take the brunt of the risk. The minimum pay they earn, around $5,000 a week, needs to stretch to payments to agents, lawyers, and the taxman. There’s no guarantee the scribe will be hired for the show or even credited for their work. The short-term hires may never set foot on set, a crucial step to becoming a showrunner.

“They’re also not getting the same level of growth and opportunities that they once did in that older model where you could grow as a writer, starting in the trenches, so to speak,” says Brian Welk, a senior business reporter for IndieWire, a film industry site. “So maybe that’s why they’re feeling disrespected.”

Studios push back on “gig economy” claim

Thursday, the AMPTP stipulated that it had offered to improve the pay structures and minimum rates for such development rooms. Moreover, the trade association pushed back against WGA language that compares writers to freelancers in a gig economy.

“Most television writers are employed on a weekly or episodic basis, with a guarantee of a specified number of weeks or episodes,” the negotiating body for studios and streaming companies wrote in its four-page document. “It’s not uncommon for writers to be guaranteed ‘all episodes produced.’”

It added that television writers enjoy health care, parental leave, and pension benefits “that are far superior to what many full-time employees receive for working an entire year.”

Other impasses in contract negotiations are over residual payments for streaming shows, script fees for staff writers, and the WGA’s insistence upon a mandatory minimum number of staff writers per show as well as guarantees of the length of employment. Deadline Hollywood recently wrote that AMPTP President Carol Lombardini “is widely seen as a tough but fair negotiator” who is keen to keep production costs from ballooning.

But during the discussions, former WGA West president Patric Verrone perceived a lack of respect.

Stephen Humphries/The Christian Science Monitor View caption Hide caption Patric Verrone, former president of the Writers Guild of America West, says the resolve of writers is stronger than during the 2007 strike.

“That may have been one of the differences between this negotiation and the others I’ve been involved in,” says Mr. Verrone, eyes squinting in the modest shade of his WGA cap. “There was a different atmosphere.”

The “Futurama” writer speculates that may stem from the change in the composition of AMPTP since the arrival of Netflix, Amazon, and Apple. But as much as writers may crave esteem, he says it won’t put bread on the table.

“As long as I’ve been in the Guild leadership, it’s become much more evident that we can get all the respect that they’re willing to dole out, but they will only make the ... financial deal that we need, that we demand, if we can show power and leverage.”

The question becomes which side will blink first.

“In many ways, the timing for the writers couldn’t be worse as far as coming to the negotiating table,” says script consultant Tom Nunan, a former TV executive and producer of the Oscar-winning film “Crash.” “The media companies themselves are going through this terrible reckoning. After years of overspending and explosive growth, they’re now in what seems to be an unending period of contraction.”

Some believe that the studios and streaming companies, which have been laying off thousands of employees, are in a position of strength in this strike. In fact, they may even have reasons to welcome the disruption to production.

“The studios think that eventually enough writers will realize that they’re having trouble paying their rent or their mortgage and demand their leadership go back to the negotiating table,” says Mr. Patten from Deadline. “And the studios, of course, can start canceling some deals after 30 days go by. ... They can save some money on the books.”

The wider cost of the strike could be disastrous for an economic sector that’s still woozy from the punch of the pandemic. Yet many unions, including local Teamsters, International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, the Screen Actors Guild – American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, and the Directors Guild of America – which begins its own contract negotiations with AMPTP next week – have expressed their solidarity to the WGA. Outside Culver Studios, virtually every passing car honks its horn to show support.

Standing next to the hedges near the mansion where Rhett Butler wooed Scarlett O’Hara, Mr. Bauman, Ms. Calo, and Mr. Bob-Waksberg say that the strike has a resonance that goes beyond New York or Los Angeles.

Jan 30 2023,Will Americans Even Notice an Improving Economy?,Paul Krugman,left,https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/30/opinion/american-economy-improvement-perception-data.html,"Imagine that your picture of the U.S. economy came entirely from headlines and cable news chyrons. Would you know that real gross domestic product has risen 6.7 percent under President Biden, that America gained 4.5 million jobs in 2022 and that inflation over the past six months, which was indeed very high last winter, was less than 2 percent at an annual rate?

This isn’t a hypothetical question. Most people don’t read long-form, data-driven essays on the economic outlook. Their sense of the economy is more likely to be shaped by snippets they read or hear.

And there is a yawning gulf between public perceptions and economic reality. Recent economic data has been positive all around. Yet a plurality of adults believes that we’re in a recession. In an AP-NORC survey, three-quarters of Americans described the economy as “poor,” with only 25 percent saying it was “good.”

You might be tempted to say, never mind the data, people know what’s happening to the economy from personal experience. But there’s a big disconnect on that front, too."
Jan 28 2023,The world economy’s inflation problem is easing,The Economist,left,https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/01/26/the-world-economys-inflation-problem-is-easing,"A fter three chaotic years, investors have several reasons to be cheerful about the world economy. In America inflation is tumbling, raising hopes of a “soft landing”, in which price growth comes under control without a recession. Fortune has smiled on Europe, where a mostly warm winter has caused energy prices to plummet. And China’s economy, freed from Xi Jinping’s destructive “zero-covid” policy, is poised to rebound. Markets are joyous. The S&P 500 index of American stocks has risen by 5% since the start of the year. Share prices in Europe and emerging markets are up by even more.

Alas, it is too soon to declare an end to the world economy’s problems. In America consumer prices fell in December, and annual inflation may dip below 2% this year thanks to cheaper energy and goods. Yet as price growth is plunging, so too is GDP growth. Retail sales and industrial production fell in December and leading indicators of output are down sharply—which usually indicates that a recession is nigh. The healthiest part of the economy is the labour market. But the red-hot demand for workers is not entirely good news: the Federal Reserve will find it harder to be sure that inflation has been tamed. Despite headline-grabbing lay-offs by the big technology firms, America’s unemployment rate remains just 3.5% and new claims for unemployment benefits are at their lowest in three and a half months. Annual wage growth has fallen according to some measures, but remains around 5%; on January 24th Walmart said it would raise starting wages from $12 an hour to $14. Because workers’ productivity is growing by only about 1% a year, fast wage growth portends price rises that far exceed the Fed’s 2% inflation target. Some policymakers hope that companies, whose profits surged in 2021, can absorb rapid wage growth without prices having to rise further. Yet by last autumn, higher profit margins accounted for only an eighth of pandemic-era inflation. Given that Wall Street is expecting disappointing earnings for the fourth quarter of 2022, this suggests that firms will raise prices in line with their labour costs. Markets expect the Fed to start cutting interest rates within a year as growth slows. But if the Fed is serious about reducing inflation to 2% and keeping it there, it will need to keep rates high until wage growth cools—even if that brings about a recession.

Should America face a downturn, it is likely to take Europe with it. Despite falling energy prices, the euro zone also has an underlying inflation problem, as is apparent in rising wage growth. Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, has warned that interest rates will have to rise significantly, contrary to the more doveish expectations of investors. A stronger dollar—which is likely if the Fed keeps raising rates and investors take fright at the consequences—would raise imported inflation and make the ecb ’s job harder still, while also paring back the rally in emerging markets.

The end of zero-covid in China has lowered the chance that supply chains will gum up. However, its rebound is not an unalloyed good for the rest of the world, which has an inflation problem, not a shortage of spending. China’s extra imports will add more fuel to overheated economies. Europe’s gas storage is so full in part because China’s demand for liquefied natural gas in 2022 was 20% below its usual level. Demand is now likely to bounce back, which could cause prices to surge once again next winter. Only when the twin foes of overheated labour markets and the energy crisis have been vanquished will the world economy be out of the woods. ■"
Aug 30 2023,Economy Grew Less than Previously Thought in Second Quarter - The Michigan Star,The Michigan Star,right,https://themichiganstar.com/news/economy-grew-less-than-previously-thought-in-second-quarter/mistarstaff/2023/08/31,"by Will Kessler

Economic growth was revised downward for the second quarter of 2022, coming more in line with economists’ original expectations, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Yearly real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised down from 2.4% to 2.1% growth in the second estimate for the second quarter of 2023, according to the BEA. The revision is more in line with original expectations from economists of around 2% growth for the second quarter, showing signs of a cooling economy.

“The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the ‘advance’ estimate issued last month,” according to the press release from the BEA. “In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 2.4 percent. The updated estimates primarily reflected downward revisions to private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by an upward revision to state and local government spending.”

Real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2023 was initially estimated to be 1.1% but was later revised up to 2.0%.

The revision was accompanied by the preliminary estimate for corporate profits, which increased 0.5% in the second quarter of 2023, which is in contrast with a decrease of 1.8% in the first quarter of 2023, according to the BEA.

Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, gave a speech last week at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, forecasting that if inflation remains high, the job market continues to grow more than expected, and economic growth persists above normal levels, the Fed will consider raising its federal funds rate. Interest rates have currently been set to a range of 5.25% and 5.50% by the Fed, the highest rates since 2001, after a series of 11 rate hikes since March 2022.

Private employment data from ADP, which has previously been optimistic in its growth projections, released its estimates for August, noting only an additional 177,000 private jobs were added for the month. For July and June, ADP initially estimated 324,000 and 497,000 new private jobs were created in the month, respectively.

The U.S. added 187,000 jobs in July, lower than the estimated 200,000 jobs by economists. The number of jobs added in May and June were both revised down by a collective 49,000 jobs.

Inflation remained elevated at 3.2% for July, rising from 3.0% in June but down from a high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Nov 14 2023,"Biden Has ""Hurt The Economy A Lot"" According To 33% Of Americans, While Only 14% Say They're Better Off",ZeroHedge,right,https://zerohedge.com/political/biden-has-hurt-economy-lot-according-33-americans-while-only-14-say-theyre-better,"A new poll from the Financial Times - Michigan Ross has delivered a stark verdict on President Joe Biden's economic policies, with only 14% of American voters feeling financially better off since his tenure began - sentiment which could pose a significant challenge to Biden's re-election hopes, and reflects widespread skepticism about his administration's economic track record.

The poll reveals that nearly 70% of voters believe Biden's economic strategies have either harmed or not impacted the US economy. A notable 33% feel his policies has ""hurt the economy a lot."" In stark contrast, merely 26% see his policies as beneficial.

The new monthly poll conducted for the Financial Times and the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business will seek to track how economic sentiment affects the race for the White House. In 1980, Republican Ronald Reagan famously asked voters whether they were better off than they were four years earlier, setting the stage for his landslide victory over incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter. -FT

Comparatively, a similar (pre-pandemic) poll from November 2019 showed less pronounced pessimism under Donald Trump’s presidency, despite most Americans feeling no improvement in their financial status. A November 2019 poll revealed that 35% of voters thought they were better off under Trump, while 31% said they were worse off.

Inflation, a persistent thorn in the Biden administration's side, continues to be the primary concern. A staggering 82% of respondents cited rising prices as their biggest financial stressor, overshadowing the administration's touted achievements in job growth and economic expansion.

""Every group — Democrats, Republicans and independents — list rising prices as by far the biggest economic threat . . . and the biggest source of financial stress,"" said Erik Gordon, a professor at Michigan’s Ross School - who says that worry over inflation spans political divides, and says it's ""bad news for Biden.""

Despite a decrease from last year's peak inflation rate, prices continue to rise significantly, evidenced by a 3.7% increase in the consumer price index compared to last year. These inflationary pressures have forced 65% of voters to cut back on non-essential spending, with more than half reducing spending on daily necessities.

While the Democratic Party recently celebrated victories in key states, the poll’s findings, combined with other national surveys, indicate potential challenges for Biden in a hypothetical match-up against Trump. With just 40% of voters approving of Biden's job performance and an even lower 36% approving of his handling of the economy, questions are being raised within the Democratic Party about his viability as a presidential nominee."

Sign up for Derek’s newsletter here.

The U.S. economy can’t be this weird forever. That’s what I keep telling myself, anyway. Eventually, I think, financial news will be boring again. Eventually, I pray, the U.S. economy won’t resemble some ever-morphing Rorschach blot. But after a year of shortages, a Great Resignation, and rising inflation, I’m still waiting for normalcy.

Here are three questions that get to the heart of what makes this moment so strange. Answering them, or at least attempting to answer them, could help indicate where things go in the second half of the year.

1. If gas prices are plummeting, why is inflation rising?

In the past two weeks, we’ve seen all sorts of evidence of “disinflation”—a decline in the rate of inflation. Retailers including Target, Gap, and Bed Bath & Beyond say they’re swimming in merchandise that they’ll have to discount. Oil prices have plunged, and gasoline prices are now coming down fast. The cost of shipping goods from China is falling. Microchip inventory is rising, which should bring down the cost of electronics. The prices of commodities such as natural gas, wheat, lumber, and other raw materials are plummeting.

Derek Thompson: ‘Everything is terrible, but I’m fine’

Falling prices sounds like we’ve reached peak inflation. But on Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that annualized inflation had surged to 9.1 percent. That’s the largest increase since November 1981. This seems utterly confounding. Inflation is a measure of the growth in prices. If prices are going down, how can inflation be going up?

The optimistic possibility is that the great disinflation has only just begun, and it wasn’t captured by the most recent report. The government’s latest data cover the month of June. But all those suddenly falling prices—on goods, energy, chips, and materials—are stories from the very end of June and early July. Plausibly, inflation was surging for much of early June and then peaked just as the calendar flipped. That means we should expect next month’s report to be much better.

But as the writer Noah Smith argues, something stranger and more disturbing may be happening. Perhaps inflation keeps contradicting optimistic headlines because the Federal Reserve has lost its magic touch.

That’s conceivably what happened in the 1970s. The oil shock came and went, but inflation kept raging as the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hikes and forecasts did little to stabilize prices. Ultimately Fed Chair Paul Volcker jacked up interest rates to 19.1 percent in the early 1980s to demonstrate how serious he was about crushing inflation. (By contrast, today’s federal-funds rate is still below 2 percent.)

For the last year, the dynamic between the Fed and the economy has been a bit like a classic scenario of a parent driving a car while noise inflation steadily rises from the backseat. “Knock it off, please,” the parent says. But the noise rises. “I said: Knock it off!” the parent repeats. And the kids just get louder. This is what it’s like for the Fed to lose credibility; small interest-rate hikes are met with accelerating price growth. The only way to beat this sort of inflation is for the person in the driver seat to do something dramatic to prove that the status quo is intolerable. If the Fed raises interest rates by a full percentage point in its next meeting, that will be a lot stronger than requesting a moment’s silence from the back seat. That’ll be more like doing a sharp U-turn, and speeding in the opposite direction until the kids promise not to speak louder than a whisper for another 35 years.

I really, really hope that our Great Disinflation moment is right around the corner. I don’t want the Fed taking a hard left and yanking up interest rates to crush the economy. But we can’t rule it out yet.

2. If jobs are growing, why is the economy shrinking? And if prices are rising, why are wages falling?

If the only economic statistic you followed was the monthly jobs report, you’d assume that the U.S. is booming. Two years ago in June, the unemployment rate was 11 percent—the highest since World War II. Today, it’s 3.6 percent—just 0.1 points away from being tied for the lowest unemployment rate since World War II. That’s a remarkable turnaround.

Annie Lowrey: America wasted its chance to push the economy forward

But if the only economic statistic you followed was GDP—and the Atlanta Fed’s unofficial GDPNow forecast—you might assume that the U.S. is in a recession. The economy contracted last quarter, and the Atlanta Fed now estimates that with the pullback in manufacturing, construction, and exports, GDP is still contracting by about 1 percentage point, annualized. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is typically (but not always) a sign of a recession.

No economy this crummy has been so amazing for finding work; but also, no economy this good for finding work has ever been this crummy. The gap between GDP and employment is the highest on record—a smashing violation of Okun’s law, the rule that employment and growth tend to move up or down in lockstep.

I’m sorry if this mystery already seems impossibly convoluted, but there’s more. Rising inflation typically occurs alongside rising wage growth. But that’s not happening right now. Weekly earnings growth has been falling; adjusted for inflation, average weekly earnings have turned sharply negative.

In sum, jobs are up, but growth is down; and inflation is soaring, but wage growth is falling. Huh?

One explanation is that rising material costs—such as energy, lumber, and metals—have dramatically held back growth, even as jobs are plentiful. That might also explain why average hourly earnings are decelerating, while inflation is accelerating: Materials costs have gobbled up the rest.

A second possibility is that companies are responding chaotically to rapid changes in demand, which is creating a “bullwhip effect.” Bloomberg’s Joe Weisenthal described it this way:

Goods become scarce. Companies fear that they will be unable to have goods to sell. They start to over-order key components, just to be sure they can keep operating. This makes goods more scarce. Eventually the cycle turns. Everyone has ordered too much. Orders get slashed. Gluts emerge. Prices fall. You know the drill.

Many companies might be at a moment in the bullwhip cycle where inventory has piled up. So they’ve slashed their orders, without yet laying people off. If enough firms did this at the same time, you’d see output declining in an economy with low unemployment. And that’s exactly what we’ve got.

A third possibility is that productivity has declined in the past few months, perhaps because of some combination of COVID, work-from-home ennui, and the aftershocks of the Great Resignation. Here’s one scenario: Let’s say you own a restaurant. Every month during the Great Resignation, one-seventh of your workers quit. Now you’ve got almost all-new kitchen staff and waitstaff, and you can’t train them fast enough. The new chefs keep messing up your nightly specials. The new waiters keep dropping plates. Every week, somebody seems to get COVID. Yes, your restaurant is fully staffed. But are you working at full capacity? Not a chance!

The chief executive of Delta recently described his airline like a real-world version of this hypothetical restaurant. “Since the start of 2021, we’ve hired 18,000 employees,” he said. “A chief issue we’re working through is not hiring but a training and experience bubble, coupling this with the lingering effects of COVID.” If many companies are stuck in this chaos bubble, it would make sense that employment is strong but output is a bit of a mess. A lot of new workers just don’t really know what they’re doing right now, and companies don’t have the capacity to train them.

Finally, the economic data might just be wrong, or temporarily janky. I’m not a Shadowstats guy. I don’t think the BLS is lying, and I trust that government analysts are doing the best they can. But monthly statistics are subject to sharp revisions. Maybe we are in a moment of transition, where the data are simply not going to make sense for a bit.

3. If consumers are miserable, why is leisure spending on fire?

Americans seem to be having a grand old time. Leisure travel is so strong that airports can barely keep up. The movie-theater box office has already set several holiday-weekend records. Despite lingering COVID fears, hotel occupancy this summer is matching its 20-year average, and restaurants are packed.

But if you ask Americans how they’re feeling about the economy, you’d better bring a pack of tissues. Consumer sentiment has plunged to its lowest rate on record.

Annie Lowrey: Why everyone is so mad about the economy

I’ve previously suggested that Americans have an everything is terrible, but I’m fine mentality about the economy. Asked about the state of the country, we’re lugubrious. “Things have never been worse,” we tell pollsters over and over. Asked about our own lives or finances, our mood lightens significantly.

But maybe I should give the American public a bit more credit. With plunging stock values and medium-term Treasuries, the market seems to be betting on a recession or something like it. Perhaps Americans are internalizing that message. Perhaps they intuitively sense that a recession is near, so they’re getting in their last thrills before the economy tips over.

Months from now, we may look back on the summer of 2022 and realize that this apparent weirdness was pretty self-explanatory, after all. We might look back and say:

America’s labor recovery was impressively swift because it coincided with an unsustainable boom in demand. Along with supply-chain challenges, this creation a classic surge in domestic inflation, with too much money chasing finite goods and services. The Federal Reserve responded by turning up interest rates to crush demand. And this predictably caused a downturn in spending and investment. In the handoff from boomflation to recession, gas prices fell before inflation, growth fell before employment, and sentiment plunged before spending. In the end, it all went in the same direction: down.

What I’m describing here is a recession. And I don’t like how plausible the story sounds. If this is the most likely alternative to the everything-is-weird economy, then I say: Keep the American economy weird."

May 07 2023,A poisoned chalice awaits Turkey’s election winner: The economy,Politico,left,https://www.politico.eu/article/turkey-elections-winner-economy-poisoned-chalice-inflation/,"The data paints a grim picture of turbulence. According to the Turkish Statistical Institute, the country's annual inflation stood at just under 44 percent for April, although ENAGrup, an independent research organization, estimated that the real rate was more than twice as high, at 105 percent. Ten years ago, in May 2013, a dollar was worth less than two Turkish lira. Today it buys almost 20. If only to add fuel to the fire, the reconstruction bill for this year’s devastating earthquake will total tens of billions of dollars.

Both sides know the priority after the vote will be to try to staunch the bleeding and turn Turkey back into a desirable destination for all-important foreign investment.

“Whoever comes to power, the main issue will be the economy and it is going to be a tough first six months,” said Uğur Gürses, a former central bank official and finance expert.

Putting the experts back in charge

Erdoğan has offered some indication he is willing to take a new tack after the election by saying in April he was seeking to assemble a team under former economy chief Mehmet Şimşek, an orthodox economist who was a darling of investors during the earlier part of the government’s rule.

Şimşek himself has turned down Erdoğan’s offer to be in his Cabinet by responding that he is not looking for a return to an active political role.

Most economists are concerned about the talent pool that Erdoğan can draw on, and worry that his post-victory recipe would simply be more of the same."

Sep 04 2023,"Biden hits out at Trump in Labor Day speech focused on US jobs, economy",Al Jazeera,left,https://aljazeera.com/news/2023/9/4/biden-hits-out-at-trump-in-labor-day-speech-focused-on-us-jobs-economy,"US president takes repeated shots at his predecessor’s economic record as 2024 election campaign begins to heat up.

US President Joe Biden has hit out at the economic policies of his predecessor and likely 2024 election challenger Donald Trump, noting that the United States lost jobs under the former Republican president’s tenure.

In a speech in Philadelphia to mark the US Labor Day holiday on Monday, Biden repeatedly took shots at Trump’s record in the White House.

“It wasn’t that long ago we were losing jobs in this country,” said Biden, who is expected to make his administration’s employment and economic policies a central plank of his 2024 re-election campaign.

“In fact, the guy who held this job before me was just one of two presidents in history who left office with fewer jobs in America than when he got elected.”

When Trump left the White House in early 2021, the US and global economies were battered by the outbreak of COVID-19, which led to the loss of millions of jobs. But the Trump administration says it oversaw historically low unemployment prior to the pandemic.

Still, Biden on Monday argued that the American economy has been transformed under his watch, with his Democratic administration putting a focus on empowering workers and strengthening the US middle class.

“When the last guy was here, he looked at the world from Park Avenue,” Biden said, referring to a wealthy street in New York City. “I look at it from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I look at it from Claymont, Delaware.”

Biden’s comments underscore his ongoing rivalry with Trump, who maintains a sizeable lead in the Republican Party’s 2024 presidential nomination race and is widely expected to take on Biden in what would be a rematch of 2020.

Trump is seeking re-election despite facing four separate criminal indictments, including two cases in which he is accused of seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 vote that he lost to Biden.

The former Republican president has denied any wrongdoing in all the cases against him and accused US prosecutors of trying to derail his 2024 campaign.

On Monday, Biden talked up his own success in passing a $1.2-trillion infrastructure bill – again drawing a contrast with Trump.

“The great real estate builder – the last guy – he didn’t build a damn thing,” the US president said of Trump, a real estate mogul.

Trump had announced “Infrastructure Week” in 2017 to promote a plan to fix highways and bridges, but the push was derailed by political turmoil in Washington at that time. “Infrastructure Week” subsequently became a joke about the chaos that engulfed the Trump administration.

Biden on Monday also criticised the right-wing theory of “trickle-down economics”, which contends that deregulation and tax cuts for the rich produce economic growth that eventually benefits working people.

“Not a whole lot of ‘trickle down’ ended up on my dad’s kitchen table, and he busted his neck,” Biden said.

Overall, Biden voiced optimism about the future of the US economy, stressing that efforts to rein in inflation are working.

But public perception of the economy could prove to be a major hurdle for the 80-year-old president’s re-election bid.

Trump often bemoans soaring US inflation, saying the country is “going to hell” under Biden.

In a Reuters/Ipsos poll last month, 60 percent of Americans – including one in three Democratic Party voters – said they disapproved of Biden’s handling of inflation.

Public opinion polls also show that voters are concerned about Biden’s age.

But on Monday, the US president seemed to dismiss the issue. “The only thing that comes with age is a bit of wisdom. I’ve been doing this longer than anybody, and I guess what, I’m going to continue to do it with your help,” Biden said."
Sep 04 2023,President Biden touts jobs and economy in Philadelphia on Labor Day – Pennsylvania Capital-Star,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,right,https://penncapital-star.com/election-2024/president-biden-touts-jobs-and-economy-in-philadelphia-on-labor-day,"PHILADELPHIA — President Joe Biden made his seventh trip of the year to the City of Brotherly Love on Monday, telling an audience of union workers that America’s best days are ahead of it, and that support for unions is the strongest it’s been in 60 years.

“I told you when I ran for president I’d have your back, and I have,” Biden said. “There are a lot of politicians in this country who don’t know how to say the word ‘union.’ I’m proud to say the word union and I’m proud to be the most pro-union president … I make no bones about that.”

The president made his remarks at a rally outside the Sheet Metal Workers office on Columbus Boulevard, ahead of the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO’s annual Labor Day parade. Despite the 80-degree temperatures and high humidity, hundreds of union workers turned out to hear the president’s Labor Day pitch.

“This Labor Day we’re celebrating jobs, good-paying jobs, jobs you can raise a family on, union jobs,” Biden said. He noted that he’s often been “called ‘middle class Joe’ like that’s somehow not complimentary. But it’s true,” he said. Biden then repeated a familiar line from his recent stump speech, with an add-on for Monday’s audience: “Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class built America,” he said. “And unions built the middle class.”

Biden said he would continue to call on Congress “to finally, and fully, pass the PRO Act,” which would amend the National Labor Relations Act to make it easier for workers to organize, and stiffen penalties against employers who violate it. And he ticked off a list of his accomplishments since he’s been in office.

“In my first two years, I created nearly 13.5 million jobs, 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Where is it written that America will not lead the world in manufacturing?” Biden said. “And the lowest stretch of unemployment below 4 percent in 50 years.”

Indeed, Biden has had a recent streak of economic victories. On Friday, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that national unemployment rose slightly in August, to 3.8%, up from 3.5% in July, and the economy added 187,000 jobs, more than the 170,000 expected, and up from the 157,000 jobs added in July. Experts interpreted the rise in the unemployment rate as a sign the economy is expanding and more people are looking for work. And last week, the Biden administration proposed a new rule that it estimates would make 3.6 million more workers eligible for overtime pay.

And in Pennsylvania, the outlook for workers is similarly positive. According to a new report from the Keystone Research Center, Pennsylvania added 23,000 union jobs in 2022, and had a record-low 3.5% unemployment rate in July. For the first six months of the year, there were about 0.7 unemployed workers per job opening, meaning there are still more job openings than workers. And, the report found, between March 2022 and March 2023, workers in the Keystone State saw 7.6% increase in their average weekly wage, a 1.7% increase after adjusting for inflation.

“Joe Biden’s got receipts,” Daniel Bauder, president of the Philadelphia Council AFL-CIO told the audience before Biden took the stage. “He’s the best union president we’ve ever had.”

Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020, capturing its 20 electoral votes and moving it back into the blue column. The Keystone State flipped red in 2016, helping Donald Trump secure his first term in office.

Trump is leading the race for the GOP nomination for 2024 by a wide margin over other candidates. He visited Pennsylvania in July, stopping in Erie for a campaign rally where he insulted Philadelphia: “Has that city gone to hell or what?”

Since announcing his reelection campaign, Trump has been indicted in four different cases, two of them directly tied to his attempts to stay in power after losing his bid for reelection. A federal indictment handed up last month, alleges that Trump began working against legitimate election results in Pennsylvania on Nov. 11, 2020, when he “publicly maligned” a Philadelphia commissioner, then repeatedly communicated with the acting attorney general and acting deputy attorney general about false allegations that Pennsylvania reported 205,000 more votes than voters.

On Monday, Biden saved his most pointed criticisms for Trump, but didn’t mention him by name. “The guy who held the job before me was just one of two presidents in history who left office with fewer jobs in America than when he was elected to office,” he said. The other president, Biden added, was Herbert Hoover.

“The great real estate builder, the last guy, he didn’t build a damn thing,” Biden said. “Under my predecessor, infrastructure week became a punchline, but on my watch, infrastructure has been a decade and it’s a headline.”

“When the last guy was here, we were shipping jobs to China,” he said. “Now we’re bringing jobs home from China. When the last guy was here, your pensions were at risk. We helped save millions of pensions with your help. When the last guy was here, he looked at the world from Park Avenue. I look at it from Scranton, Pennsylvania, I look at it from Claymont, Delaware.”"

Which countries will suffer?",Quartz,center,https://qz.com/biden-called-chinas-economy-a-ticking-time-bomb-whic-1850729773,"Last week, US President Joe Biden called China a “ticking time bomb” after consumer prices fell there for the first time in two years, and gave an ominous warning about the potential for China to do “bad things” during difficult economic times.



Biden’s warning comes with China-US relations at a low. The US president signed an executive order earlier in the week that blocks US venture capital firms from investing in sensitive Chinese tech like advanced computer chips.

China’s economic woes can be partly attributed to the pandemic and its zero covid policy, which persisted long after highly effective covid-19 vaccines were developed. The economic train wreck was caused by a multitude of issues that have been building for more than a decade, argued economist George Magnus in The Guardian. Bad debt, unprofitable infrastructure, vacant real estate, underutilized public transport, and overcapacity in sectors like coal and steel have all slowed down China’s economy.

Shares of China’s largest private property developer hit new lows on Friday as the company approaches restructuring, along with rivals China Evergrande Group and Sunac China Holdings. China also reported the lowest level of monthly new bank loans in over a decade in July.

To help manage the country’s borrowing, the national government in Beijing announced it would allow local governments to issue 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion) of bonds to absorb the debt of local-government financing vehicles. “That consolidation isn’t an immediate positive catalyst but could help with general cleanup of debt down the line,” wrote analysts at Bespoke.

How could a potential Chinese downturn affect the US economy?

The risk this downturn poses to the US economy depends on who you talk to.

Thierry Wizman, a g lobal foreign exchange and i nterest r ates s trategist at Macquarie Group , said in a recent research note that China’s slow growth could actually help slow global inflation despite high stock market valuations and a rapid increase in US Treasury issuance. Bill Adams, the chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an emailed statement that the low growth in China’s property sector is depressing prices for steel, nickel, aluminum, and copper. All of this will also help to curb US inflation.

It’s possible that China could retaliate against US export restrictions by halting rare earth metal sales to the US, Tom Plumb, CEO of mutual fund Plumb Funds, told Reuters. If China chooses to create a shortage of rare earth metals—provided they are willing to bear the consequences—this would naturally lead to increased prices for products that rely on these metals, like electronics.

But the US is unlikely to see a blow to its economy come directly from China’s slowdown, according to David Dollar, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Brookings Institute. The US is not an export dependent country; it sells about $150 billion worth of goods each year to China. If 10% of that gets erased, there won’t be much impact to the American economy overall.

China is much more deeply integrated with Asian trading partners like Japan and South Korea, as well as a few European trading partners like Germany. Countries that export copper, iron, oil and natural gas to China would also be hurt.

“You could have spillover effects, [which] partly depends on how serious a recession we’re talking about,” Dollar said. “If China’s growth slows down for a while, that’s not going to have a big effect on the US economy. If you really had a serious growth crisis in China and some kind of global financial crisis, you probably wouldn’t start with the United States, but we would not be exempt from that.”

Things could get much worse if China invades Taiwan

Biden didn’t specify what he meant when he said China might do “bad things,” but the president might have been referring to been escalating tensions between China and Taiwan. Some analysts argue that China uses nationalism and foreign confrontations to distract from domestic problems.

Biden has said that his administration is willing to stand up against China if it threatens to invade Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory, but the island nation has been functionally independent since 1949. In the last several year, China’s Air Force and Navy have been escalating provocative patrols into Taiwan’s national airspace and maritime boundaries, according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

Elina Ribakova, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told CNBC that China is observing and learning from Russia’s strategies to bypass US sanctions levied due to its war of aggression against Ukraine. If China were to invade Taiwan, the US would be forced to slap much tougher sanctions on it. This could disrupt up to $3 trillion in trade and financial flows according to an analysis by the Atlantic Council and the Rhodium Group.

“This is nearly equivalent to the gross domestic product of the United Kingdom in 2022,” Rhodium’s Charlie Vest and Agatha Kratz wrote. “Impacts of this scale make them politically difficult outside of an invasion of Taiwan or wartime scenario.”"

Feb 28 2023,"In Egypt, government and poor struggle with troubled economy",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/egypt-economic-crisis-inflation-russia-ukraine-war-0bf22bb11d5b7fe2060eac52279b9df3,"CAIRO (AP) — A group of women stands in front of a vegetable vendor at a street market in one of Cairo’s oldest neighborhoods, yelling in frustration.

“Every day there are new prices,” one said. “When will this war end?” another shouted, cradling a baby in her arms.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, now in its second year, has pushed up food and energy prices worldwide, adding another layer to Egypt’s economic crisis. Soaring inflation, a severely weakened currency and other problems have followed decades of government mismanagement and broader disruptions, starting with the turmoil from the 2011 Arab Spring popular uprising, then years of militant attacks, followed by the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine.

The crisis has pushed many Egyptians out of the middle class, while the country’s poor — about one-third of the population — are cutting back on life’s essentials. Many are asking how long they can survive like this.

Hany Hassan has found himself struggling to feed his four school-age children. His pay from his job as a bartender at a coffeehouse is buying less and less.

“This past year was the hardest in my life,” said Hassan, 43, who earns roughly $110 a month working 12-hour shifts seven days a week. “I am scared that one day I won’t be able to feed the kids.”

Annual inflation reached 26.5% in January, the highest in five years, with food prices in urban areas soaring 48%, according to official figures.

Many essentials including rice, cooking oil, bread and most recently, eggs, have all doubled in cost in Cairo’s supermarkets. The prices of 1 kilogram (about two pounds) of chicken or other meat have almost doubled from a year ago, hitting 300 Egyptian pounds (roughly $10) for meat and nearly 90 Egyptian pounds (roughly $3), for chicken.

The surge has made those proteins a prohibitive luxury for all but the wealthiest.

The war in Ukraine, which rattled the global economy, hit Egypt where it is financially vulnerable. The most populous Arab country and world’s biggest importer of wheat needs to buy a majority of its food from other countries to help feed its population of more than 104 million.

“It is, therefore, important to view Egypt’s inflation problem within the context of its broader external position issues,” said Callee Davis, an economist at Oxford Economics Africa.

Egypt’s import bill first ballooned because of higher global prices for commodities like fuel and wheat that are purchased in dollars, and this led to foreign currency shortages, Davis said. That forced the Central Bank of Egypt to pass policies to preserve the country’s foreign reserves, including restrictions on imports, which drove inflation even higher, Davis said.

The war also has slowed Egypt’s economic growth. In February, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development revised its forecasts for Egypt’s growth this year to 4.3%, down from its previous projection of 5%.

For many, hardships started in 2016 when President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi’s government embarked on a reform program intended to reverse longstanding distortions in Egypt’s economy in return for loans from the International Monetary Fund. The program introduced new taxes and included substantial cuts in state subsidies on basic goods — a policy that dated back decades.

Western governments and international financial institutions hailed the austerity measures. However, they have made life difficult for regular Egyptians. El-Sissi has blamed the war in Ukraine for the most recent inflation spike.

“Circumstances are tough for all the world. This crisis is not ours,” he said in a recent speech.

To help poor and middle-class families face the repercussions of the measures, the government bolstered welfare programs, raised salaries of civil servants and postponed cuts to subsidized bread and planned electricity price hikes.

It also established hundreds of government-owned markets across the country that sell staples for cheaper prices.

Then the government resorted to the IMF for a new bailout loan last year, the fourth in six years. The hope is that the $3 billion deal will help generate another $14 billion from Egypt’s international and regional partners, including wealthy Gulf monarchies.

But Gulf Arab states seem increasingly reluctant to help Egypt as they have over the past decade.

“We need to see reforms. We are taxing our people. We are expecting also others to do the same, to do their efforts. We want to help, but we want you also to do your part,” Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said at the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, in January.

Egypt has pledged to uphold the IMF-guided reforms, including a free-floating exchange rate and lessening the military’s powerful grip on the economy — a significant concession.

The government in December adopted a privatization initiative, saying it would withdraw from industries not considered strategic by 2024. The policy aims to bolster the private sector’s contribution to the economy to 65% by 2025 from 30% in 2021.

Leaders are facing criticism for their handling of the economy and costly infrastructure projects, including a new $45 billion capital building, other developments and highways. Many have taken to social media to complain, with some calling for the government to step down.

One of the country’s richest people, billionaire businessman Naguib Sawiris, recently told a Lebanese newspaper that Egypt needs a political and economic overhaul.

The government has repeatedly defended such megaprojects as essential for improving living conditions and generating jobs for the growing population.

HA Hellyer, a geopolitical expert at the London-based Royal United Service Institute for Defense Studies, said the pressures on the Egyptian economy would be staggering for any government.

“Some good moves have been taken, the question is whether these are sufficient to turn the economic crisis around or not, and if not, what other options are the authorities willing to entertain?” he said.

In the meantime, Egyptians are growing more despondent.

Samira Abdel-Wahab, an accountant working for the state-run electricity company, roamed from stand to stand at the Megharbleen street market in Cairo’s Darb el-Ahmar neighborhood, looking for the cheapest prices.

“I fear the damage is beyond repair,” said the 37-year-old mother of three."

Aug 30 2023,Economy Grew Less than Previously Thought in Second Quarter - The Florida Capital Star,The Florida Capital Star,right,https://floridacapitalstar.com/news/economy-grew-less-than-previously-thought-in-second-quarter/gastarnewsstaff/2023/08/31,"by Will Kessler

Economic growth was revised downward for the second quarter of 2022, coming more in line with economists’ original expectations, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

Yearly real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised down from 2.4% to 2.1% growth in the second estimate for the second quarter of 2023, according to the BEA. The revision is more in line with original expectations from economists of around 2% growth for the second quarter, showing signs of a cooling economy.

“The GDP estimate released today is based on more complete source data than were available for the ‘advance’ estimate issued last month,” according to the press release from the BEA. “In the advance estimate, the increase in real GDP was 2.4 percent. The updated estimates primarily reflected downward revisions to private inventory investment and nonresidential fixed investment that were partly offset by an upward revision to state and local government spending.”

Real GDP growth for the first quarter of 2023 was initially estimated to be 1.1% but was later revised up to 2.0%.

The revision was accompanied by the preliminary estimate for corporate profits, which increased 0.5% in the second quarter of 2023, which is in contrast with a decrease of 1.8% in the first quarter of 2023, according to the BEA.

Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, gave a speech last week at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, forecasting that if inflation remains high, the job market continues to grow more than expected, and economic growth persists above normal levels, the Fed will consider raising its federal funds rate. Interest rates have currently been set to a range of 5.25% and 5.50% by the Fed, the highest rates since 2001, after a series of 11 rate hikes since March 2022.

Private employment data from ADP, which has previously been optimistic in its growth projections, released its estimates for August, noting only an additional 177,000 private jobs were added for the month. For July and June, ADP initially estimated 324,000 and 497,000 new private jobs were created in the month, respectively.

The U.S. added 187,000 jobs in July, lower than the estimated 200,000 jobs by economists. The number of jobs added in May and June were both revised down by a collective 49,000 jobs.

Inflation remained elevated at 3.2% for July, rising from 3.0% in June but down from a high of 9.1% in June 2022.

Organizers told me that this event is a major moneymaker for local businesses and our economy. This year, they tried to focus on bringing in more local vendors.

""You know, they look forward to the rodeo all year. And this is the first year that we've actually been able to actually have true vendors out here, so this year, last year, we had probably 18 vendors. This year will have about 48 vendors out in the fan zone,"" said Greg Howard, Outside Event Trailboss for the rodeo.

""We have people coming from all over the country and now it's international, Canada Mexico, to not only enjoy the rodeo but the local attractions,"" said Carroll.

Those tourists spend money at local restaurants, hotels, shops, museums, and national parks. Organizers say they hope to keep as much money coming to the rodeo in the local community.

Average hourly earnings, a key figure as the Federal Reserve fights inflation, rose 0.4% for the month, good for a 4.4% annual pace. Both numbers were higher than the respective estimates for 0.3% and 4.2%. Hours worked nudged down to 34.3.

The unemployment rate was 3.5%, against a consensus estimate that the jobless level would hold steady at 3.6%.The rate is just above the lowest level since late 1969.

Another important figure, the labor force participation rate held at 62.6%, the fifth straight month at that level. The rate for those in the 25-to-64 ""prime"" age group edged lower to 83.4%.

A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell to 6.7%, down 0.2 percentage point from June. The survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed a more robust gain of 268,000.

Stocks rallied following the news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 200 points in early trading. Treasury yields fell sharply.

The unemployment rate for Blacks moved lower to 5.8% while the rate for adult women nudged higher to 2.7%. The rate for Asians tumbled to 2.3%, a 0.9 percentage point drop and just off its lowest ever in data going back to January 2000.

""The labor market seems to be humming along rather well at this point in the business cycle,. A 3.5% unemployment rate, you can't complain about that,"" said Satyam Panday, U.S. chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""It's a nice glide path down. We would have liked to see wage growth come down a little, but the purchasing power of the consumer seems to be holding up well.""

Health care led job creation by industry, adding 63,000 jobs for the month. Other sectors contributing included social assistance (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and wholesale trade (18,000). The other services category contributed 20,000 to the total, which included 11,000 from personal and laundry services.

Leisure and hospitality, which has been a leading sector for most of the recovery in the Covid pandemic era, added just 17,000 jobs, consistent with a slowing trend after averaging gains of 67,000 a month in the first three months of 2023.

Previous months' totals were revised lower — the June count dropped to185,000, a downward revision of 24,000, while May was cut to 281,000, down 25,000 from the previous estimate.

Even with the slowing job gains, the economy has proved resilient against a variety of challenges, particularly a series of 11 Federal Reserve interest rate hikes aimed at bringing down inflation.

This is a ""really, really solid labor market,"" said Jonathan Stokoe, senior vice president at job placement firm Adecco. Going forward, companies likely will focus on ""retention of quality employees, upscaling and reskilling,"" he added.

Most Wall Street experts have been forecasting a recession at least for the past year, but growth has managed to stay positive as consumers keep spending and the services sector rebounds from its pandemic-related disruptions.

Gross domestic product gains have averaged 2.2% annualized for the first half of 2023, and the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of growth is pointing to a 3.9% gain for the third quarter.

""Overall, this is still not the picture of the labor market we would expect to see if the economy were in danger of decelerating dramatically in the short term, although without question there are signs of moderation,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at asset management giant BlackRock.

Fed officials including Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the full effect of the rate increases has not been felt yet. Economists worry that the Fed could overtighten and send the economy into recession.

Following the payrolls release, market bets that the Fed would hold rates steady at its September 19-20 meeting edged higher to an 83.5% probability, according to CME Group data. Though policymakers have indicated they expect one more quarter percentage point increase before the end of the year, markets are expecting that the Fed is done with this rate-hiking cycle.

Inflation data of late has been moving in the right direction. However, the Fed's preferred gauge is still showing prices rising at a 4.1% annual rate, or more than double the central bank target.

Wages have been one component of the inflation picture. Average hourly earnings had been declining, though the annual figures are somewhat distorted by comparisons to a year ago when wages were surging.

A Labor Department gauge that the Fed follows closely showed compensation costs rising at a 4.5% 12-month rate through the second quarter. That level is not consistent with the Fed's inflation target.

At the same time, recession fears on Wall Street appear to be ebbing. Goldman Sachs has been slowly reducing its probability for a contraction, and Bank of America this week said it now thinks the U.S. could avoid a recession completely."

Jan 27 2023,How will we know if the US economy is in a recession?,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-recessions-and-depressions-federal-reserve-system-business-economy-3e9274e43fb6232528035e0f1cdd0ac0,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The second consecutive quarter of economic growth that the government reported Thursday underscored that the nation isn’t in a recession despite high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s fastest pace of interest rate hikes in four decades.

Yet the U.S. economy is hardly in the clear. The solid growth in the October-December quarter will do little to alter the widespread view of economists that a recession is very likely sometime this year.

For now, the economy expanded at a 2.9% annual rate in the fourth quarter, though some of the underlying figures weren’t as healthy. Consumer spending, for example, grew at a slower pace than in the previous quarter, and business investment was weak. Last quarter’s growth was fueled by factors that won’t likely last. These include companies’ restocking of inventories and a drop in imports, which meant that more spending went to U.S.-made goods.

Increased borrowing rates and still-high inflation are expected to steadily weaken consumer and business spending. Businesses will likely pare expenses in response, which could lead to layoffs and higher unemployment. And a likely recession in the United Kingdom and slower growth in China will erode the revenue and profits of American corporations. Such trends are expected to cause a U.S. recession sometime in the coming months.

Still, there are reasons to expect that a recession, if it does come, will prove to be a comparatively mild one. Many employers, having struggled to hire after huge layoffs during the pandemic, may decide to retain most of their workforces even in a shrinking economy.

Six months of economic decline is a long-held informal definition of a recession. Yet nothing is simple in a post-pandemic economy in which growth was negative in the first half of last year but the job market remained robust, with ultra-low unemployment and healthy levels of hiring. The economy’s direction has confounded the Fed’s policymakers and many private economists ever since growth screeched to a halt in March 2020, when COVID-19 struck and 22 million Americans were suddenly thrown out of work.

Inflation, the economy’s biggest threat last year, is now showing signs of steadily declining. Used and new cars are becoming less expensive. Price increases for furniture, clothes and other physical goods are slowing.

Last year, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate seven times, from zero to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The Fed’s policymakers have projected that they will keep raising their key rate until it tops 5%, which would be the highest level in 15 years. As borrowing costs swell, fewer Americans can afford a mortgage or an auto loan. Higher rates, combined with inflated prices, could deprive the economy of its main engine — healthy consumer spending.

Fed officials have made clear that they’re willing to tip the economy into a recession if necessary to defeat high inflation, and most economists believe them. Many analysts envision a recession beginning as early as the April-June quarter this year.

So what is the likelihood of a recession? Here are some questions and answers:

____

WHY DO MANY ECONOMISTS FORESEE A RECESSION?

They expect the Fed’s aggressive rate hikes and high inflation to overwhelm consumers and businesses, forcing them to slow their spending and investment. Businesses will likely also have to cut jobs, causing spending to fall further.

Consumers have so far proved remarkably resilient in the face of higher rates and rising prices. Still, there are signs that their sturdiness is starting to crack.

Retail sales have dropped for two months in a row. The Fed’s so-called beige book, a collection of anecdotal reports from businesses around the country, shows that retailers are increasingly seeing consumers resist higher prices.

Credit card debt is also rising — evidence that Americans are having to borrow more to maintain their spending levels, a trend that probably isn’t sustainable.

More than half the economists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics say the likelihood of a recession this year is above 50%.

___

WHAT ARE SOME SIGNS THAT A RECESSION MAY HAVE BEGUN?

The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. Claudia Sahm, an economist and former Fed staff member, has noted that since World War II, an increase in the unemployment rate of a half-percentage point over several months has always signaled a recession has begun.

Many economists monitor the number of people who seek unemployment benefits each week, a gauge that indicates whether layoffs are worsening. Weekly applications for jobless aid actually dropped last week to a historically low 190,000. Employers continue to add many jobs, causing the unemployment rate to fall in December to 3.5%, a half-century low, from 3.7%.

___

ANY OTHER SIGNALS TO WATCH FOR?

Economists monitor changes in the interest payments, or yields, on different bonds for a recession signal known as an “inverted yield curve.” This occurs when the yield on the 10-year Treasury falls below the yield on a short-term Treasury, such as the three-month T-bill. That is unusual. Normally, longer-term bonds pay investors a richer yield in exchange for tying up their money for a longer period.

Inverted yield curves generally mean that investors foresee a recession that will compel the Fed to slash rates. Inverted curves often predate recessions. Still, it can take 18 to 24 months for a downturn to arrive after the yield curve inverts.

Ever since July, the yield on the two-year Treasury note has exceeded the 10-year yield, suggesting that markets expect a recession soon. And the three-month yield has also risen far above the 10-year, an inversion that has an even better track record at predicting recessions.

___

WHO DECIDES WHEN A RECESSION HAS STARTED?

Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”

The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It puts heavy weight on a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security.

Yet the NBER typically doesn’t declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes for up to a year.

___

DOES HIGH INFLATION TYPICALLY LEAD TO A RECESSION?

Not always. Inflation reached 4.7% in 2006, at that point the highest in 15 years, without causing a downturn. (The 2008-2009 recession that followed was caused by the bursting of the housing bubble).

But when it gets as high as it did last year — it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June — a downturn becomes increasingly likely.

That’s for two reasons: First, the Fed will sharply raise borrowing costs when inflation gets that high. Higher rates then drag down the economy as consumers are less able to afford homes, cars and other major purchases.

High inflation also distorts the economy on its own. Consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, weakens. And businesses grow uncertain about the future economic outlook. Many of them pull back on their expansion plans and stop hiring. This can lead to higher unemployment as some people choose to leave jobs and aren’t replaced."
Sep 23 2023,"Trump Up 9 Points on Biden as Voters Fret About President’s Age, Economy - The Florida Capital Star",The Florida Capital Star,right,https://floridacapitalstar.com/news/trump-up-9-points-on-biden-as-voters-fret-about-presidents-age-economy/jtnews/2023/09/24,"by Madeleine Hubbard

President Joe Biden’s age is not the only hurdle he will be facing in the 2024 presidential election, as record numbers of Americans say they are worse off financially under his presidency and former President Donald Trump is polling significantly higher in a hypothetical 2024 matchup, according to a poll released Sunday.

Just 15 percent of Americans say they are financially better off under Biden, which is among the lowest of all presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. Meanwhile, 44 percent of Americans say they are not as well off as they were before Biden entered the Oval Office, which is the highest percentage of Americans to say so for any ABC/Post poll since the outlets began posing the question in 1986.

Additionally, the poll showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Biden in a hypothetical 2024 matchup, with 51 percent saying they would support Trump to Biden’s 42 percent.

Trump’s approval rating has increased since he left office when it was at 38 percent. The latest poll showed that 48 percent of Americans say they approve of Trump’s performance.

While Biden would be 82 years old at the start of his second term if reelected and Trump would be 78 years old if he were elected in 2024, 74 percent of Americans say Biden is too old for another term as president while 49 percent say Trump is too old, the poll also showed.

Biden’s approval rating of 37 percent is another area he is struggling in. His ratings on his handling of the economy and immigration are at career lows as well at 30 percent and 23 percent approval ratings, respectively.

Langer Research Associates conducted this poll from Sept. 15-20 with 1,006 U.S. adults and it has a 3.5 percent margin of error.

The poll comes as Biden is facing calls to not run in 2024 over concerns about his age.

Jun 28 2023,What Biden can take credit for on the economy — and what he can't,CNN (Online News),left,https://cnn.com/2023/06/28/economy/bidenomics-biden-economy/index.html,"Washington, DC CNN —

President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally unveiled “Bidenomics,” the ground-up economic philosophy he claims serves as the driving force behind the US economy’s success.

When an economy grows “from the middle out and the bottom up instead of just the top down… everybody does well,” Biden said in a speech from Chicago.

But the economy’s track record under Biden is anything but flawless. And while Biden’s growing list of Republican challengers differ on many issues, when it comes to the economy, they’re in agreement that Biden failed.

In reality, it’s a mixed bag.

Americans have grappled with inflation for more than a year, including a painstaking issue with housing affordability as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 10 times in a row to bring that inflation down.

In addition, a tight labor market has left many small businesses with ongoing hiring difficulties. Meanwhile, in anticipation of a recession, large companies have tightened their belts and resized their workforce by laying off thousands of workers.

But it hasn’t all been bad. American workers have rejoiced in a robust labor market that has allowed them to quit their jobs for a better one — one that can pay them more or allow them the flexibility of working from home.

Many Americans were given a financial boost during the Covid pandemic in the form of stimulus checks and a break from student loan payments, although the latter are restarting later this year.

The economy evolved immensely during and after the pandemic. Here’s what Biden can take credit for – and what he can’t.

Fiscal largesse

Some major spending packages passed by Congress did happen under Biden’s watch — from the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act — funneling trillions of dollars toward infrastructure, workforce development, state and local governments and the costly public health response to Covid.

While government spending bolsters consumer demand, it also boosts business investment. Manufacturers’ spending on construction has soared in recent months due to funding Congress approved for infrastructure.

The Treasury Department released an analysis this week that showed the increase in construction spending from manufacturers has been “principally driven by construction for computer, electronic, and electrical manufacturing” and that “the surge appears to be uniquely American — not mirrored in other advanced economies.”

Biden can claim credit for that, but until manufacturers begin to hire workers at a solid clip, it’s hard for Biden to declare there’s a manufacturing boom.

For now, demand for goods has slowed in the United States and other major economies, according to business surveys from S&P Global and the Institute for Supply Management.

In other aspects, the labor market certainly had a boost from Biden’s fiscal policies. The American Rescue plan provided $40 billion toward workforce development, funneled through state and local governments, which aimed to address demographic disparities and invested in the public health workforce.

Still, the economic outlook remains uncertain. While Biden joked Wednesday that he has heard people “forecast the possibility of a recession for 24 months, and it hasn’t happened,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a central banker panel Wednesday he is not ruling out a recession. However, some economists and bank CEOs think a recession could come later than expected.

Plentiful jobs and record low unemployment — but not all thanks to Biden

Since Biden took office in January 2021, the unemployment rate has plunged to 3.7% from 6.3%. All the jobs that were lost due to the pandemic-induced recession were fully restored last summer. Since then, the American workforce has consistently outpaced the pre-pandemic workforce.

However, the labor market had begun to make a comeback well before Biden’s inauguration. Many of the job gains during his presidency were likely a continuation of the bounce-back effect that came as the economy reopened.

Americans are also earning more. Since Biden became president, average hourly earnings have risen by 12% to $33.44, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although that is also connected to the pace of post-pandemic recovery.

And, as Biden pointed out Wednesday, several polls indicate job satisfaction is at a record high.

That said, the labor market is unbalanced.

There are almost 4 million more job openings than the number of people looking for work. That has forced employers to raise wages to lure in more workers.

Biden sees that as a victory. “Pay for low-wage workers is growing at the fastest pace in over two decades,” he said Wednesday.

However, the Fed is less gung-ho about those wage increases, since they’re feeding directly into inflation.

Is Biden to blame for inflation?

Republicans have repeatedly slammed Biden for decades-high inflation, decrying it as the consequence of out-of-control government spending. The causes of inflation are nuanced, but a faction of economists and analysts argue that generous government spending played some role.

Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chair who helmed the central bank during the Great Recession, and Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, argued in a paper presented at the Brookings Institution in May that inflation’s eruption was first driven by shortages and energy prices.

But the two economists asserted that inflation continued to rise because of stimulus-fueled demand and low interest rates.

Although the spending packages passed under Biden are not the main culprits behind inflation – war in Ukraine and the pandemic played a huge part – government spending did play some role. It’s just no longer a source of inflation.

“I will add, though, without crossing any lines, that the spending during the pandemic was very high and it’s come down — and so we look at the fiscal impulse from the level of spending and it’s really not material. It may even be slightly contraction, but let’s just say it’s flat,” said Fed Chair Jerome Powell Wednesday during a panel hosted by the European Central Bank. “If you look at where the inflation is in the economy, I wouldn’t say that that’s an important driver of inflation or something that we think about or consider.”

Inflation has in fact retreated from the four-decade high in June 2022, in large part due to falling energy prices, but Bernanke’s paper argued that the economy needs to slow further to address the labor market’s persistent impact on inflation.

Biden’s response to the inflation criticism is that it’s worse in other major economies.

Americans are in more debt than ever

Whether or not Biden is to blame for inflation, it’s undeniable that it has created financial hardships for Americans.

Household debt is at a $17 trillion record high, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

That’s a 16% increase from when Biden took office.

Americans are piling on debt and struggling to make loan repayments on time as inflation continues to erode the value of their paychecks.

It’s clear that Americans have been remarkably resilient in the face of high inflation, punishing rate hikes, persistent housing unaffordability, economic uncertainty and an unforgiving pandemic that upended every facet of society. Biden should be given credit whenever it is due, but so should everyday Americans."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images

Confused about the economy? You're not alone.

At the start of the year, warnings of a looming recession seemed to be everywhere, like in this NPR story.

But so far, to the surprise of many experts, the economy has proven to be remarkably resilient.

In the second quarter, from April through June, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2.4% — that's a faster pace than Wall Street economists expected.

People have continued to spend money, on both goods and services, according to a Bureau of Economic Analysis reading released on Thursday. That includes housing and health care, vehicles and gasoline.

And, although the latest GDP number is an initial estimate — and may be revised --- the trend looks promising. In the first quarter of 2023, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 2%.

Then there were comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at a press conference on Wednesday, when he said that the outlook of the economists, statisticians, and other experts working at the central bank has gotten rosier.

""Given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession,"" he said.

So what gives? Does this mean recession fears are over?

Here's what you need to know about the state of today's economy.

Why are things looking better?

For two years, inflation has been the dark cloud hanging over the economy, but we're beginning to see patches of blue sky.

Annual inflation in June was just 3% — still above what the Federal Reserve would like, but a big improvement from a year earlier when inflation topped 9%.

What's more, this progress has come with very little pain in the job market, even as the Fed has raised interest rates in the most aggressive fashion since the 1980s.

The unemployment rate is currently 3.6%, close to a 50-year low. And employers are still adding a couple hundred thousand jobs every month.

Thanks to that strength, wages are now climbing faster than prices, so workers can actually buy more with their paychecks.

All of that is pretty encouraging and suggests there might be a wider path to the elusive ""soft landing,"" in which inflation is tamed without a big jump in unemployment.

That seems contrary to what many were expecting?

Indeed. Economic forecasters have become significantly more optimistic.

A January survey by the National Association for Business Economics found just 42% of forecasters thought the U.S. was likely to avoid a recession in the next 12 months. When the survey was conducted again in early July, 71% of forecasters said a recession is unlikely in the coming year.

And you can see this improving outlook clearly on Wall Street. At the start of 2023, markets were bracing for a tough year, especially with a debt ceiling showdown looming.

There were rough spots, for sure. Investors were rattled in March by the collapse of some mid-sized banks.

But regulators stepped in, taking over Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and then helping engineer the sale of a third failed lender, First Republic Bank, to JPMorgan Chase in May.

Then House Republicans and White House averted what would have been a disastrous debt default.

Those developments helped soothe a lot of nerves on Wall Street.

And more recently, investors have taken stock of the economy and they have been even more relieved it hasn't turned out quite as bad as they had first feared.

The result is that all three major stock indexes — the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 — are in bull markets, having gained 20% or more from their most recent lows.

On a conference call with investors this week, Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharf said what many forecasters are saying: ""The U.S. economy continues to perform better than many expected.""

So how are the experts looking at the economy now?

These days, the word that seems to be catching on in Wall Street and corporate suites is one that also starts with an ""R"": No, not recession, but resilient.

Economists at Goldman Sachs have been unusually confident among their peers that the Fed would be able to get inflation under control without triggering a recession.

But now, Goldman is sounding even more upbeat, putting the odds of a recession at just one in five.

""Why are we more optimistic?"" asked Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist. ""To us the economy continues to look quite resilient.""

And again, the strong job market is a big factor.

It's something echoed in Wednesday's comments from Powell.

""My base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses,"" he told reporters after the Fed decided to raise interest rates by another quarter point.

So are recession fears gone now?

Not by a long shot.

Because inflation is still higher than the Federal Reserve would like, policy makers are widely expected to raise interest rates by another quarter percentage point this week.

These rate increases make it more expensive to get a car loan or to finance a business or to carry a balance on your credit card.

Moreover, the ripple effects of rate hikes come with a lag. It's possible that the pain usually associated with higher borrowing costs hasn't caught up with the economy yet ... but that eventually it will.

A number of forecasters — like those at Citigroup — still believe there's a recession on the horizon. It's just taking longer than expected to materialize.

Certainly there are some parts of the economy that are feeling a slowdown already. Manufacturing, for example, has been in a slump for a while.

Even though consumers are still spending money, they're spending more of it on services — like eating at restaurants or traveling — and less on stuff. As a result, factories, which make stuff, are feeling the squeeze.

And the prospect of a downturn in the job market is still possible. That would mean more layoffs than what the economy has experienced so far.

So how to navigate this uncertain time?

Unfortunately, despite all the recent positive news about the economy, this period of uncertainty will continue for both regular folks and CEOs alike.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk last week captured what many people are likely to be feeling about the economy.

""One day it seems like the world economy is falling apart, and the next day, everything is fine,"" Musk said on a call with Wall Street analysts. ""I don't know what the hell is going on, to be totally frank. I wish I did.""

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was similarly unsure about where the economy is heading, noting there are ""a range of outcomes"" and urging investors to ""take a deep breath"" and hope for the best.

What are some of the things to watch?

Of course, experts will continue to closely scrutinize the key economic indicators, mainly inflation and the labor market.

Company profits will be another important gauge. So far, only a fraction of companies have reported earnings for the most recent quarter.

Another thing to watch is how companies are handling their debt. Many corporations borrowed money when interest rates were really low. How will they manage that when it comes time to refinance, likely at much higher rates?

Commercial real estate is another big question mark. There's a lot of unused space in office buildings because many people are still working remotely. What happens to the loans on that real estate, and what does that mean for banks that financed them — especially smaller, regional banks?

There are other potential speed bumps in the road. The extra cash cushion that many people piled up in the early months of the pandemic is being whittled away.

And payments on student loans that were suspended during the pandemic are about to start up again. That will leave less money in people's pockets to maintain that robust spending.

All this is to say, it could still be a very bumpy ride."

Mar 14 2023,Inflation declines to 6% in February in sigh of relief for economy,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/inflation-declines-to-6-in-february-in-sigh-of-relief-for-economy,"Inflation slowed to a 6% rate in the year ending in February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday, a welcome sign as the Federal Reserve prepares to meet for a monetary policy meeting.

The much-anticipated numbers from the consumer price index show that, while inflation is much too high, it is cooling in response to the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes.

Inflation had been running at 6.4% the month before. Tuesday’s report marks seven straight months of declines in annual inflation after the rate peaked at a whopping 9.1% in June.

SVB COLLAPSE: FED’S PLAN FOR RATE HIKES FALL BY THE WAYSIDE

Prices overall grew by 0.4 percentage points between January and February (as opposed to an annual basis), according to the index, a deceleration from December to January.

Meanwhile, “core inflation,” which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was at 5.5% in the year ending in February.

The higher prices are hitting consumers hard. The rising cost of food, in particular, has been difficult for many households. The price of chicken has risen 8.8% over the last year, while dairy products have increased in price by 12.3%.

The news comes amid heightened tensions in the financial sector after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced on Friday that Silicon Valley Bank, known as SVB, had failed and been taken into government hands, followed by crypto lender Signature Bank on Sunday. Officials provided reassurances over the weekend that the banking system was sound.

“That’s one data point, a signal, in the continuing trend of the Fed’s policy, but in light of SVB, it raises questions as to the Fed’s next action next week,” Brian Marks, executive director of the University of New Haven’s Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program, told the Washington Examiner. He added that a milder rate hike is likely.

The Fed will meet next week to decide whether to raise interest rates, with some expressing concern that if it does hike rates once again, it could lead to a recession. Investors were hoping for a cooler CPI report this week so that the Fed might hold off on hiking this month, given the SVB collapse.

Meanwhile, the labor market has remained red-hot despite the now-yearlong series of interest rate revisions.

Last week, it was announced that the economy gained 311,000 jobs in February. Job gains have consistently been strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down.

The stronger jobs reports show the Fed’s rate hikes aren’t yet having the punch officials want, and it could cause the Fed to lean toward a more aggressive monetary stance at its meeting later this month, although the SVB debacle is pushing back on that pressure.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that hot inflation reports and job data “suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”"

Aug 14 2023,Country Garden's troubles are just the latest piece of bad news for China's flailing economy,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/08/14/country-garden-china-real-estate-crisis-demographics-population,"Good morning, Peter Vanham here in Geneva, filling in for Alan.

China’s economy faces the test of a lifetime as it tries to revive its fortunes amid an unprecedented set of challenges: a real estate crisis, deflation, a consumer confidence crisis, and a declining population.

The headline news this weekend came from Country Garden Holdings, one of the largest and previously most stable real estate developers in the country. It missed a debt payment, and now faces the risk of a default. The company said it had underestimated the market downturn and is now confronting the largest challenge since it was established in 1992.

But that news is just the latest worrisome headline. China’s real estate woes started in 2021 after the central government intervened to limit the sector’s ballooning debt. The move backfired, however, as it led to the near-collapse of Evergrande, at that point the largest real estate developer in the country, as well as the bankruptcy of several other real estate developers, and a steep drop-off in prices.

Yet even if further real estate bankruptcies can be avoided, the damage to the Chinese economy has largely been done. As real estate prices fell, the economy went into a deflationary spiral, leading, in turn, to a prolonged crisis in consumer confidence, and an overall slump in economic growth. In March, China’s statistical office even stopped publishing its monthly consumer confidence data after the index failed to recover to an “optimistic” outlook for over a year.

Two weeks ago, then, the government decided to act more forcefully. It expanded its economic stimulus package, subsidizing domestically-produced goods and tourism, as well as home renovation. But the measures may be too little, too late.

First, as my former colleague at the Financial Times, global China editor James Kynge, noted this weekend, “fragile consumer confidence is just one sign of a malaise that is not merely economic;” that malaise also includes a “strange hybrid of psychological and political factors.”

To be more precise, Kynge, who has lived on and off in China since the late 1980s and witnessed the Tiananmen protests firsthand, said: “Under Xi Jinping, China’s leader, a concept of ‘comprehensive national security’ has come to dominate almost every aspect of life. The economy, culture, society, technology, ecology and others are officially classified as matters of national security deemed essential to the party-state’s survival.”

And second, China also still faces the deeper problem that the time to “get rich before they get old” has started to run out. An aging population plus a drop-off in birth rates means China’s population is shrinking, falling by 850,000 people last year, according to the country’s statistics bureau. The decline in China’s population will increasingly drag down the economy. That reality will have consequences for anyone involved in China’s fortunes, whether at home or abroad.

Jun 19 2023,China cuts two more key lending rates as economy sputters,CNBC,center,https://cnbc.com/2023/06/20/china-cuts-two-more-key-lending-rates-as-economy-sputters.html,"The People's Bank of China has cut several key policy rates to bolster economic growth in the world's second-largest economy.

The People's Bank of China cut two more key lending rates on Tuesday for the first time in 10 months to prop up growth in the world's second largest economy.

The Chinese central bank cut the one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points from 3.65% to 3.55%, and trimmed the five-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points from 4.3% to 4.2% — for the first time since August.

""On their own, 10bps cuts are too small to make a great deal of difference to monetary conditions, especially since market interbank rates are already below policy rates,"" Capital Economics' Julian Evans-Pritchard and Zichun Huang wrote in a note.

""But the PBOC tends to use changes in policy rates as signaling tool, with the heavy lifting being done by other tools such as adjustments to reserve requirements and bank loan quotas,"" they added. ""The latest round of rate cuts suggests that these tools will be deployed too.""

A gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese developers, the Hang Seng mainland properties index, fell more than 3%, with Country Garden slumping by about 5%. About half the participants in a Reuters poll had forecast a deeper cut of at least 15 basis points to the five-year rate."

Apr 27 2023,The US economy grew at a much slower pace in the first quarter,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/27/economy/q1-us-gdp-economy/index.html,"Washington, DC CNN —

US economic growth slowed to an annualized and seasonally adjusted rate of 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, as businesses rebalanced their inventories and pulled back on spending amid punishing rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

The increase in gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — was far below economists’ expectations of 2% and represents a more moderate pace compared to the previous two quarters, according to data released Thursday by the Department of Commerce.

The January-to-March period was also marked in its later weeks by mounting fears that a meltdown in the banking sector and a pending debt ceiling crisis could trigger a recession.

The GDP report affirms that the US economy has lost momentum in recent months, with many economists also forecasting a recession later in the year. The Federal Reserve has been striving for months to cool the economy, which has remained strong despite nine straight rate hikes.

“The slightly cooler than expected GDP report will not prevent the Fed from making another quarter percentage point rate hike at its decision next Wednesday,” said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. “The Fed wants the economy to run below potential for a while to allow supply and demand to get into better balance.”

Strong consumer spending belies slowing business investment

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic output, contributed the most to the first quarter’s growth as Americans continued to spend robustly on goods and services, especially in restaurants and bars.

Spending was stronger compared with the previous quarter, led by purchases of cars and vehicle parts and health care services. Meanwhile, a rise in imports and a sharp decline inventories dragged on growth.

However, high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s yearlong rate-hiking campaign weighed on business spending, which fell in the beginning of the year. Residential and nonresidential investment declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.

Robust economic activity in January helped to drive the overall growth in the first quarter, economists said.

In January, consumer spending advanced a solid 2% and employers added close to half a million jobs. Spending and payroll growth cooled in the following months as inflation, higher borrowing costs, and colder weather weighed on output. The 236,000 jobs added in March was the smallest monthly gain in more than two years and household spending grew by a modest 0.2% in February.

Spending on goods and services in the January-through-March period was the strongest since the second quarter of 2021.

But spending is expected to fizzle out in the coming months because that strength earlier in the year was due to higher credit card usage, a drawdown in savings, warmer weather, and “increased reliance on sputtering state and local stimulus programs,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Financial.

“Instead of the consumer continuing to pull back, we saw a lot of that temporary support hold up spending in the first quarter or, as I like to describe it, the consumers’ last stand,” Piegza said. “Most of those supports will not prove lasting, so it’s likely that growth will continue to slow under the weight of elevated inflation and as the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates.”

Strong decline in business investment

Business spending, which is highly sensitive to the direction of the economy, remained in contraction territory in the first quarter as companies cut back on equipment, and residential fixed-investment firms continued to struggle.

“This data, while firmly in the rearview mirror, illustrates that American firms are growing increasingly concerned regarding the sustainability of the current business cycle as the lagged impact of rate hikes, elevated inflation and tighter lending which is now evident inside the real economy will all combine to finally cause the consumer to capitulate later this year,” Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US, wrote in an analyst note.

Business investments are often made through credit, so higher borrowing costs coupled with slowing economic activity can curb those investments, but that also varies depending on the size of a firm, said Eugenio Aleman, chief economist at Raymond James.

“Small businesses, which typically use their own cash flows instead of borrowing, have continued to invest in the economy, so nonresidential fixed investments have continued to expand, but their contribution to GDP growth is very small,” Aleman said.

Residential fixed investment, which includes construction of housing units, dragged on growth in the first quarter as rising interest rates continued to take a toll on the interest rate-sensitive housing market, despite a brief reprieve from rising mortgage rates earlier in the year.

Recessionary forecasts

Economists, including those at the Federal Reserve, expect the US economy to tilt into a recession later in the year. Aleman said that he expects the economy to grow by an annual rate of 0.8% in the second quarter, then to enter a mild recession in the third quarter, mostly due to the effects of tighter monetary policy.

Some businesses remain optimistic in their outlooks for the rest of the year.

Adrian LaTrace, chief executive of Boyd Industries, a manufacturer of dental equipment based in Clearwater, Florida, said that activity in the first three months of year wasn’t as strong as last year, and instead resembled pre-pandemic times. Still, he said sales for the quarter were up about 10% and that quotes for equipment orders have been strong. He said part of that was likely due to deferred patient loads that dental offices are chipping away at, helping sustain activity.

“I don’t see sales being affected significantly in any unfavorable way the rest of the year, and we are dealing with input cost pressures related to materials, which have normalized a bit, but the biggest challenge I see is on the labor force side,” LaTrace said.

LaTrace said his company has struggled to hire workers across the board, which he said has held back the company’s expansion.

“If we can get even more rank-and-file employees for the factory with certain skill sets and for the sales and customer service side, I have no doubts that we can continue to grow the company and perhaps even at a faster rate than what we’re growing presently,” LaTrace added."

Sectors adding jobs included health care (63,000), social services (24,000), financial activities (19,000) and hospitality (17,000). Jobs cuts were seen in manufacturing and employment services at 2,000 and 8,000, respectively.

Last month, the unanimous decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates put the key benchmark federal funds rate at a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest since 2001, further restricting economic activity as the borrowing costs for homes, cars and other items march higher.

It marks the 11th rate increase aimed at combating high inflation since policymakers began tightening in March 2022.

FED HIKES RATE TO 22-YEAR HIGH

Following the Fed's last meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell said policymakers will continue to monitor data points to assess another rate hike this year.

""Looking ahead, we will continue to take a data-dependent approach in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate,"" he said during a press conference.

Currently, 81% of market participants expect the Fed to keep rates as is at the next meeting, according to the CME's Fed Watch Tool.

The data follows Fitch's downgrade of U.S. credit, which is creating a fresh wall of worry about the economy and financial markets, with the S&P 500 headed for a weekly loss.

May 20 2020,Trump’s economy is a disaster,Jennifer Rubin,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/05/20/trumps-economy-record-calamity/,"The Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday released its economic projections for the remainder of 2020 and for 2021. “CBO estimates that real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) will contract by 11 percent in the second quarter of this year, which is equivalent to a decline of 38 percent at an annual rate. In the second quarter, the number of people employed will be almost 26 million lower than the number in the fourth quarter of 2019.”

It might be worse than that, of course. The CBO assumed that social distancing measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders, shutting down nonessential businesses) peaked in April. “The agency expects that, from that peak, social distancing will drop by roughly two-thirds during the second half of this year and diminish further, but by smaller amounts, through the third quarter of 2021,” the report states. “That decline is in the middle of the distribution of possible outcomes, in the CBO’s assessment, and allows for regional and seasonal variation.” However, if we get a second waveof covid-19 infections, those social distancing measures will go right back to where we were in April. In short, the CBO’s is making an informed economic decision based on the supposition we will not have to close down again, a questionable premise considering the experience in China and some European countries.

Even in the best-case scenario, when stay-at-home orders are relaxed, improvement in the labor market “will not be large enough to make up for earlier losses. Compared with their values two years earlier, by the fourth quarter of 2021 real GDP is projected to be 1.6 percent lower, the unemployment rate 5.1 percentage points higher, and the employment-to-population ratio 4.8 percentage points lower.” And, of course, should the Republican-held Senate refuse to enact more fiscal stimulus, the economy could sink further and the recession could last longer, according to Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell.

A significant part of the economic collapse was the plunge in consumer spending. (“Most states ordered businesses to close and people to stay home during the last two weeks of March, which greatly curtailed consumer spending. . . . Spending may have been down by almost 28 percent as a result of the pandemic; spending on accommodations and restaurants declined by 60 percent to 80 percent; and spending for some goods (such as clothing) dropped by similar amounts.” Even after stay-at-home orders are lifted, unemployed Americans will have less to spend and others may not feel safe returning to stores, entertainment venues, restaurants and bars. To be candid, until there is a cure or a vaccine, do not expect that we will get back to a healthy economy soon.

Given the dismal figures, the aversion from the administration and Senate Republicans to new stimulus seems extremely ill-advised. Democrats prodded Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in a hearing on the pandemic’s economic meltdown to get behind a stimulus, but Republicans seem unmoved. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) fussed that the Fed would be buying up defunct malls. Powell retorted: ""I think the credit risk is minimal to us.” The danger he kept reminding the senators is that we are doing too little, not spending and lending too much.

Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional spending to prevent long-term damage to the economy. ""What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful,"" Powell said. “I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, ‘Is it enough?’ And we need to be prepared to act further. And I would say we are if the need is there,” Powell added.

Mnuchin, following the lead of Trump and other Republicans, seemed less enamored of passing new legislation.

Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are rightly perturbed that loans are going to big businesses and the well-connected without sufficient guarantees to keep workers employed. Equally distressing is how little of the original stimulus money has been disbursed.

Trump, rather than be concerned with executing the laws Congress passed and encouraging more fiscal action, is caught up in conspiracy theories, sneering at “blue state bailouts” and pushing crank remedies. As bad as the CBO’s projections were, they might have been duly optimistic.

Biden’s remarks come after Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo reacted to the U.S. Department of Labor’s latest report released on Friday showing the unemployment rate rose from 3.5% to 3.8% in August, the highest level since February 2022. The report noted 736,000 people began looking for work last month, the most since January, and not all of them secured employment right away.

Senate Republican leadership released a report in July showing inflation has soared by 16.6% since Biden took office. Grocery prices have increased by 20%, the report said, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data, while energy prices have increased 38%. As of July, prices rose by 3.2% on average over the past 12 months. The August Consumer Price Index is not expected to be released until Sept. 13.

""The reality is that inflation still exists, and it is something that people see on a daily basis when they go to the grocery store, or pay their rent, or pay their mortgage, and we have to know that,"" Raimondo told CBS’s ""Face The Nation"" in an interview that aired Sunday. ""That’s still a challenge for folks. That being said, if you look at where we are today, compared to when the president took office, it’s an unbelievable story of progress.""

Biden also used his speech Monday to take several jabs at former President Trump.

""We also passed the bipartisan infrastructure law. You can't have the strongest economy in the world with a second-rate infrastructure. Can you believe we used to have the best infrastructure in the world? And then we fell to the number 13 in the world,"" Biden said. ""And guess what? The great real estate builder – last guy here – he didn't build a damn thing.""

BIDEN DOESN’T THINK AUTOWORKERS WILL STRIKE, AS DEADLINE LOOMS

Biden claimed that since he took office, private companies have invested $510 billion in America, referring to South Korea's second-largest conglomerate SK Group’s recent $22 billion commitment to new investments in the United States for semiconductors, green energy and bioscience projects.

""By the way, we invented the semiconductor. We used to have 40% of the market,"" Biden said, before mentioning SK Group, ""When I asked the CEO why, why America? This what he said, number one, ‘There's no safer place in the world to have my investment than the United States of America.’ And number two -- this is the God's truth – ‘You have the best workers in the world.’""

Mar 23 2023,Walmart Layoffs At Fulfillment Centers Signals Ominous Sign For Economy,ZeroHedge,right,https://zerohedge.com/markets/walmart-layoffs-fulfillment-centers-signals-ominous-sign-economy,"Over the next three months, hundreds of workers at five Walmart warehouses handling e-commerce orders will be laid off. This situation could be a worrisome indication that consumers are tapped out.

A Walmart spokesperson told Reuters about 200 warehouse workers in Pedricktown, New Jersey, and hundreds of others at Fort Worth, Texas; Chino, California; Davenport, Florida; and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania locations were asked to find new jobs before summer due to the need to reduce headcount.

""We recently adjusted staffing levels to better prepare for the future needs of customers,"" Walmart said in a statement.

Layoffs at Walmart are considered an indicator of retail trends due to its size in the retail space, and might serve as a warning sign of potential economic turbulence ahead.

Earlier this month, we noted ""consumers hit a brick wall"" as credit demand - function of soaring interest rates - slumped amid a surge in tightening lending standards.

We've shown readers consumers have racked up insurmountable credit card debts while draining personal savings to near-record-low levels.

Apr 28 2022,The US economy shrank in the first quarter,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/28/economy/us-economy-first-quarter-gdp/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

America’s economy unexpectedly shrank in the first quarter of 2022, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday.

The nation’s gross domestic product – the broadest measure of economic activity – declined at an annualized rate of 1.4% between January and March in an abrupt reversal of the prior year’s strong growth.

While one quarter does not yet make a trend, it is a warning sign for how the recovery is going: Two straight quarters of declining growth meet a commonly used definition of a recession.

It was a marked slowdown from the 6.9% growth pace recorded in the final quarter of last year, and the worst performance since the pandemic recession in the second quarter of 2020. Economists had predicted an annualized growth rate of 1.1%, according to Refinitiv.

Despite the lower numbers, President Joe Biden categorized the US economy as “resilient in the face of historic challenges,” in a statement released Thursday morning.

“While last quarter’s growth estimate was affected by technical factors, the United States confronts the challenges of Covid-19 around the world, Putin’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and global inflation from a position of strength,” the statement said.

What drove the decline?

Much of the first quarter decline in the United States was due to a decrease in inventory investment, which had been booming in the final months of 2021.

That means the GDP decline should be taken with a grain of salt, warned Ryan Sweet, senior director of economic research at Moody’s Analytics, on Wednesday before the data was published.

Exports and government spending also fell, while imports rose. Consumer spending, which is vital to the economy, increased as prices kept rising. Americans spent more on services, led by health care. That offset a small decline in goods spending, which shrank due to lower spending on gas.

Gas prices shot through the roof in response to Russia’s war in Ukraine, which jolted energy markets around the world.

The price index tracking personal consumption expenditure rose 7% in the first three months of the year, or 5.2% when stripping out energy and food prices.

“It is unfortunate that this GDP rate did not meet expectations, but unsurprising as the US economy remains very volatile with geopolitical turbulence from the war in Ukraine, a global supply chain crisis, increasing inflation and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” said Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, in emailed comments. “All of these factors have shrunk GDP growth rates around the globe.”

A second estimate of first quarter GDP growth will be published at the end of May.

What this means for the Fed

The unexpected GDP decline likely didn’t change the immediate outlook for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy.

The central bank, which is starting to reverse course after a period of ultra-loose policies during the pandemic, is expected to raise interest rates next week. It would be the second rate hike of the year. The vast majority of market participants expect a half-percentage-point increase, up from the quarter-point hike announced in March. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said a bigger rate hike was on the table for the May meeting.

“The Fed will continue to press on the policy brakes with increased determination over the coming months as inflation shows pesky persistence,” said Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon.

While economists still hope that March may have marked the pandemic inflation peak, only the April economic data, which is still some weeks out, can confirm that.

On Friday, the Commerce Department will report the Personal Consumption Expenditures, or PCE, price index for March.

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the economy expanded in the first quarter of the year."
Jan 10 2023,World Bank warning: Global economy is at risk of recession,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/europe-business-china-world-bank-economy-391bd23625e205a0d94c1d1c224892a8?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=TopNews&utm_campaign=position_05,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The global economy will come “perilously close” to a recession this year, led by weaker growth in all the world’s top economies — the United States, Europe and China — the World Bank warned on Tuesday.

In an annual report, the World Bank, which lends money to poorer countries for development projects, said it had slashed its forecast for global growth this year by nearly half, to just 1.7%, from its previous projection of 3%. If that forecast proves accurate, it would be the third-weakest annual expansion in three decades, behind only the deep recessions that resulted from the 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

Though the United States might avoid a recession this year — the World Bank predicts the U.S. economy will eke out growth of 0.5% — global weakness will likely pose another headwind for America’s businesses and consumers, on top of high prices and more expensive borrowing rates. The United States also remains vulnerable to further supply chain disruptions if COVID-19 keeps surging or Russia’s war in Ukraine worsens.

And Europe, long a major exporter to China, will likely suffer from a weaker Chinese economy.

The World Bank report also noted that rising interest rates in developed economies like the United States and Europe will attract investment capital from poorer countries, thereby depriving them of crucial domestic investment. At the same time, the report said, those high interest rates will slow growth in developed countries at a time when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has kept world food prices high.

“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has added major new costs,” World Bank President David Malpass said on a call with reporters. “The outlook is particularly devastating for many of the poorest economies where poverty reduction is already ground to a halt and access to electricity, fertilizer, food and capital is likely to remain limited for a prolonged period.”

The impact of a global downturn would fall particularly hard on poorer countries in such areas as Saharan Africa, which is home to 60% of the world’s poor. The World Bank predicts per capita income will grow just 1.2% in 2023 and 2024, which is such a tepid pace that poverty rates could rise.

“Weakness in growth and business investment will compound the already devastating reversals in education, health, poverty and infrastructure and the increasing demands from climate change,” Malpass said. “Addressing the scale of these challenges will require significantly more resources for development and global public goods.”

Along with seeking new financing so it can lend more to poorer countries, Malpass said, the World Bank is, among other things, seeking to improve its lending terms that would increase debt transparency, “especially for the rising share of poor countries that are at high risk of debt distress.”

The report follows a similarly gloomy forecast a week earlier from Kristina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, the global lending agency. Georgieva estimated on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that one-third of the world will fall into recession this year.

“For most of the world economy, this is going to be a tough year, tougher than the year we leave behind,” Georgieva said. “Why? Because the three big economies — U.S., EU, China — are all slowing down simultaneously.”

The World Bank projects that the European Union’s economy won’t grow at all next year after having expanded 3.3% in 2022. It foresees China growing 4.3%, nearly a percentage point lower than it had previously forecast and about half the pace that Beijing posted in 2021.

The bank expects developing countries to fare better, growing 3.4% this year, the same as in 2022, though still only about half the pace of 2021. It forecasts Brazil’s growth slowing to 0.8% in 2023, down from 3% last year. In Pakistan, it expects the economy to expand just 2% this year, one-third of last year’s pace.

Other economists have also issued bleak outlooks, though most of them not quite as dire. Economists at JPMorgan are predicting slow growth this year for advanced economies and the world as a whole, but they don’t expect a global recession. Last month, the bank predicted that slowing inflation will bolster consumers’ ability to spend and power growth in the United States and elsewhere.

“The global expansion will turn into 2023 bent but not broken,” the JPMorgan report said.

Sep 23 2022,Investors are now bracing for 'hard landing' for economy,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/investors-bracing-recession-fed,"Markets have been in decline for the past two weeks as investors prepare for the growing likelihood that the Federal Reserve won’t be able to avoid plunging the economy into a recession.

A month ago, some economists were giving about even odds that the Fed could pull off a “soft landing,” which means tamping down inflation by raising interest rates while skirting an economic recession. Since then, investor outlook appears to have quickly become gloomy in the face of a worse-than-expected inflation report and another massive rate hike.

August’s hotter-than-expected consumer price index report found inflation ticked down to 8.3% for the 12 months ending in August — but that number that was higher than economists had expected.

That immediately caused markets to crater amid anticipation that the Fed would have to bruise the economy even more in order to tame prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 1,200 points the day the report came out, the seventh biggest decline in points in U.S. history. The Nasdaq composite plunged by more than 5%, and the S&P 500 had about 4.3% of its value erased last Tuesday.

JOBLESS CLAIMS TICK UP TO 213,000, PAUSING ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE ECONOMIC TRENDS

The Fed then followed up the report with a monster rate hike to the tune of three-quarters of a percentage point, or 75 basis points. The one-two punch seemed to be a wake-up call for Wall Street that the economic “pain” that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described in August was right on the horizon.

“I think it’s finally sinking in across all kinds of investors and bond traders and businesses — it’s finally sinking in that, yeah, this is not going to be a soft landing. … We’re going to incur a little pain, and I think the real uncertainty now is for how long,” Victor Claar, an economics professor at Florida Gulf Coast University, told the Washington Examiner.

As Claar spoke on Friday, the markets continued to tumble. The Dow was down more than 600 points at midday. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were both in the red by more than 2%, with the latter losing more than 12% of its total value in just the past month alone.

The concern among investors was also highlighted by the VIX, also known as the “fear index.” The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is intended to gauge volatility in the markets. The index was up nearly 10% on Friday alone, a big leap. It is up 75% since the start of the year.

“The market has been transitioning clearly and quickly from worries over inflation to concerns over the aggressive Federal Reserve campaign,” said Quincy Krosby of LPL Financial. “You see bond yields rising to levels we haven’t seen in years — it’s changing the mindset to how does the Fed get to price stability without something breaking.”

The two-year Treasury yield, which is very sensitive to changes in economic policy, punched above 4.2% on Friday, the highest level since 2007 as the Great Recession took hold. The yield on the 10-year hit its highest level in more than a decade on Friday before falling back a bit.

Bank of America strategists also announced in a note that investors are flocking toward cash amid the current market upheaval. The group said that investor sentiment is “unquestionably” the worst it has been since the 2008 global financial crisis, another ominous warning for the future of the economy.

Powell couldn’t do much to ease the fear of a recession among investors when he spoke at a press conference on Wednesday. After being positive most of the day, stocks ended up falling and closing down as analysts parsed through Powell’s words and the economic projections released by the central bank.

Claar said that two major things stood out in the Fed’s statement following its two-day meeting. The first is that the Fed made it clear it is willing to do at least another full percentage point worth of hikes by the end of this year and that it expects to return inflation back to its 2% target baseline by the end of 2024 — meaning that the country could be in for high inflation for another two years.

“I think both of those things were pretty sobering,” said Claar. “We should have connected the dots and expected both of those things.”

Indeed, Powell has tried to warn that the landing might not be a soft one. He gave perhaps his most hawkish speech yet when he delivered his annual address at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, about a month ago.

“Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” the Fed chairman warned. “Moreover, there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions. While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.”

Two succeeding quarters of negative gross domestic product growth have already occurred, something that has traditionally been seen as a recession marker. The one factor pushing back on that determination, though, is the country’s surprisingly strong labor market. For several months, the economy has continued to add jobs at a better-than-expected rate. Powell’s recent statements and economic forecasts, however, suggest that the gains are not expected last.

Average consumers also appear to be anticipating a recession. A recent analysis by Cinch Home Services found that internet searches for “recession” in the United States are up a whopping 355% this year.

The Fed will next meet in November to decide its next course of action regarding interest rates. It will be watching the September inflation and job reports closely to determine how much it will hike."

Nov 06 2022,"The state of the economy on Election Day, explained in 6 numbers",Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/6/23440840/economy-inflation-midterms,"The economy has been one of the most important issues for Americans ahead of the midterm elections.

Nearly everything has become more expensive compared to a year ago. The cost of food, rent, energy, medical care, and new cars has soared in the past year. Rising prices have weighed heavily on the minds of voters who will soon determine the outcome of elections across the country and could lead to a shift in control of the House and Senate, which has big implications for the Biden administration’s policy agenda.

According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, the economy was the top issue for voters: 79 percent of registered voters said the economy would be very important to their voting decisions, which was the highest share of the 18 issues included.

It’s no surprise that the economy has been an important issue for voters this year. But the country’s economic situation is confusing: Inflation has spiked, but the labor market has added hundreds of thousands of jobs to the economy for months. And fears of a recession have grown, even as persistent labor shortages make it harder for companies to fill open positions.

Ahead of Election Day, here are six numbers that help us better understand the state of the economy.

1) Inflation: 8.2 percent in September

Overall, prices have risen 8.2 percent from a year before, according to September’s Consumer Price Index report. Although prices for gas and used cars have fallen in recent months, prices for food, rent, and medical care have surged. Both Democrats and Republicans have focused their campaign messaging on inflation in recent months, vowing to help Americans cope with rising prices.

The most influential factor, though, isn’t fiscal policy, it’s the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes. Since March, the central bank has been aggressively lifting rates to bring inflation under control. On November 2, the Fed raised rates by 0.75 percentage points, another unusually large increase.

2) The price of gas: $3.80/gallon as of November 6

Gas prices have fluctuated in recent weeks, but they’ve come down from their peak of more than $5 a gallon in mid-June. Average national gas prices were $3.80 a gallon as of Sunday, according to data from the American Automobile Association. Fuel prices spiked earlier this year after oil demand rebounded from pandemic lows and the war in Ukraine drove oil prices up. Several factors have since pushed down the cost of gas, including a drop in oil prices as recession fears have grown.

Despite the recent decrease, gas prices are still higher than they were a year ago, when they averaged $3.42 a gallon.

3) The unemployment rate: 3.7 percent in October

Many Americans might have dim thoughts about the economy, but economic data makes it clear: The labor market is still strong. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7 percent, a slight uptick compared to September but still near a half-century low. Employers added 261,000 jobs to the economy in October, according to Labor Department data released on Friday.

That marks a slowdown in hiring compared to earlier in the year when the economy was making up for more jobs lost during the pandemic, but it’s still a robust amount. Labor economists have grown warier about a more significant slowdown in the coming months, though, as the Fed’s interest rate hikes continue to ripple through the economy. Some investors and economists have also expressed concerns that the central bank will raise rates too much if Fed officials believe the economy hasn’t cooled enough for inflation to come down.

It’s a difficult balancing act. By raising rates and making borrowing money more expensive, the Fed is effectively trying to weaken consumer demand, which should eventually lead to slower price growth. But that could also lead to businesses hiring fewer workers or laying them off. Lags in economic data also make it difficult to determine the full effect of the price hikes in real time.

4) Job openings: 10.7 million in September

Job openings have come down from their peak in March but remain high at 10.7 million in September (in comparison, there were 7 million job openings in February 2020).

The numbers reflect the difficulties that many companies are facing. Labor shortages during the pandemic have made it harder for businesses to fill open positions, leading to firms having to shell out more to cover the cost of labor. Some of those cost increases have also been passed on to consumers.

5) Gross domestic product: 2.6 percent in the third quarter

After declining for two straight quarters, the economy started to grow again. In the third quarter, GDP grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate, according to data released late last month.

But the gains were mostly driven by trade, as American companies exported more goods and services and imports fell. Major components of the report — consumer spending and residential investment — reflected a weakening economy. Spending slowed from the previous quarter, and residential investment fell 26.4 percent on an annualized basis after falling 17.8 percent in the second quarter.

6) New home sales: 603,000 units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in September

The housing industry, one of the sectors most sensitive to interest rates, has been hammered by the Fed’s rate hikes, and home sales have plummeted as a result. Sales of new single-family houses in September were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 603,000 units, which is down 17.6 percent from a year before, according to Census Bureau data.

Earlier in the pandemic, mortgage rates hit record lows, leading to more people searching for a home. With more potential buyers bidding for homes, prices shot up. While home prices aren’t rising as rapidly as they were last year, they’re still much higher than they were before the pandemic. The combination of steeper mortgage rates and more expensive homes has pushed some potential buyers out of the market.

At the end of October, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate surpassed 7 percent for the first time since 2002, according to Freddie Mac data. The rate has since come down to 6.95 percent as of November 3."

New York CNN —

After months of a remarkably strong US labor market and economy, everything seems to be slowing down.

The latest high-frequency data shows that the consumer could be running out of steam, hiring activity is moderating, business activity is softening, interest-rate sensitive sectors are pulling back and housing is suffering.

The question is whether Friday’s monthly jobs report, easily the most anticipated piece of data out this week, will confirm the trend.

The unflinching resilience of the US labor market is one of the greatest sources of tension in today’s economy. Federal Reserve officials have said employment numbers and the pace of wage increases need to shift lower before “sticky” inflation can be overcome.

Over the past year, the Fed has raised interest rates from nearly zero to a range of 4.75% to 5% to cool the economy. But jobs numbers have blown past expectations for the past 11 months. Unemployment currently sits near historic lows at 3.6%.

A slowdown in the official US jobs report Friday could signal an economic sea change.

Slowly cooling: “Recent labor market evidence, along with our conversations with business executives, indicate that hiring efforts have been scaled back notably across numerous sectors,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY, in a note on Wednesday. That could mean payrolls for March come in well below the 240,000-consensus estimate, he added.

More jobs data released this week shows that hiring may be slowing. ADP estimated that private sector employment rose by 145,000 jobs in March, below the 200,000 consensus forecast; and ADP’s measure of year-over-year wage growth slowed to 6.9% from 7.2%.

The February JOLTS Report, meanwhile, showed that job openings dropped 632,000 to 9.93 million in February, from 10.56 million in January. That’s the lowest level of job openings since May 2021.

The strength of the American consumer — which Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has previously said was single-handedly propping up the US economy — also appears to be waning.

Spending momentum cooled in February, and analysts are expecting more weakness in March.

The US Treasury publishes daily data for tax refunds, and “the level of tax refunds to households tells us something about how much support there is to consumer spending,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. Tax refunds in recent weeks have been coming in at a lower rate than in the previous two years.

“Credit conditions are tightening and the recent banking sector stress will only further exacerbate the impact, leading to slower spending on big-ticket items and services,” wrote Daco.

Existing home sales, meanwhile, have plunged more than 20% over the past year and the latest ISM manufacturing survey shows that business investment is slowing. Commercial real estate is in trouble and while major US stock indexes are up this year, there’s underlying weakness in market fundamentals.

Wrapping it up: “The economy is unwell. It’s not the flu, but it is a throat ache. And it’s unlikely to get better in the coming months,” wrote Daco.

Friday’s job report will give us a better idea of how sick the economy actually is.

Geopolitical tensions further threaten bank stability: IMF

Strained ties between China and the United States and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have led to an increase in financial isolation over the past few years.

Those tensions have slowed international investments and hurt payment systems and asset prices, undermining global financial stability, wrote the International Monetary Fund in a new report on Wednesday. “This in turn fuels instability by increasing banks’ funding costs, lowering their profitability, and reducing their lending to the private sector,” they said.

The report comes as credit lines tighten in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and subsequent financial system crisis.

Rising geopolitical tensions add to that, wrote the IMF. “Imposition of financial restrictions, increased uncertainty, and cross-border credit and investment outflows triggered by an escalation of tensions could increase banks’ debt rollover risks and funding costs,” according to the report, led by Mario Catalán, deputy chief in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department of the IMF.

Those tensions, wrote researchers, “could also drive up interest rates on government bonds, reducing the values of banks’ assets and adding to their funding costs.”

At the same time, geopolitical tensions also affect banks through the real economy. Supply chain and commodity market disruptions hurt growth and lead to elevated inflation, which reduces banks’ profitability.

“The stress is likely to diminish the risk-taking capacity of banks, prompting them to cut lending, further weighing on economic growth,” said the report.

Walmart will slow hiring, rely more on AI

Walmart (WMT) plans to slow its pace of hiring in the coming year and focus on building out AI technology to serve customers.

The retailer announced at its annual investor meeting this week that it intends to depend heavily on automation to achieve its goal of adding more than $130 billion, or 4%, in sales over the next five years.

“We’ll grow our top line, improve our margin and improve our return on investment,” CEO Doug McMillon told investors Wednesday. “That’s reflected in our five-year plan. We think growing a company of this size in the 4% range over time and growing profit faster than sales is achievable.”

Walmart also said it plans on servicing about 65% of its stores by automation by 2026. The company also announced that it expects 55% of fulfillment center volumes to go through automated warehouses in the next three years, which it said would lower unit cost prices by 20%.

Shares of Walmart stock closed Wednesday up 1.7%."

But the longer the war goes on, the more expensive it gets, no matter how many weapons flow into the country. Ukraine has no shortage of willpower to fight, but how long can the country afford it?

As the war with Russia grinds on, Ukraine’s economy is under pressure and dependent on foreign aid. The average Ukrainian faces an uncertain future, but is still finding ways to persevere.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs around $5 billion a month and $55 billion next year to cover the deficit and begin rebuilding. At least for the time being, Ukraine seems to be getting by on less, says researcher Rajan Menon.

Ukraine’s economy is currently suspended between two competing forces. On one end, the Russian invasion has pulled it consistently toward decline: a 25% and accelerating poverty rate, a 35% contraction of gross domestic product, an inflation rate rising above 26%. On the other end are billions of dollars in military and humanitarian aid to the country, which experts say keep the economy stable.

Last January, Oleksandr Kachanovskyy and his family put all their savings into two big purchases: a new car and new furniture for their home in Mariupol.

A month later, Russia’s invasion destroyed that second purchase. Shelling and street fighting leveled the city over a three-month siege. “There was no place to live,” says Mr. Kachanovskyy. “The conditions were unbearable.”

So in late March, Mr. Kachanovskyy and his family packed into their new Volkswagen and drove to Lviv, where his father had once lived. They spent two weeks with family and then found free housing in a dormitory for students at the local hospitality college, on the outskirts of the city, surviving on his salary alone.

For now, Mr. Kachanovskyy feels fortunate to have a home and some income, starting as the dormitory’s nighttime security guard last fall. With subsidized housing, his family can survive on the small salary. “Of course, our income is not that big,” he says, “but it’s enough and could be much worse.”

Noah Robertson/The Christian Science Monitor View caption Hide caption Oleksandr Kachanovskyy worked at a metal plant in Mariupol for 39 years, only leaving because of the war. He's now a nighttime security guard at the university dormitory where he and his family are staying in Lviv, Ukraine, Dec. 1, 2022.

Diminishing employment, rising costs

Lviv is a portrait of the country’s fragile, and often contradictory, economy. Its western location has made it a sanctuary for citizens fleeing the war. Some 400,000 displaced people stayed in Lviv at some point last year, though only 200,000 remain, says Andriy Moskalenko, the city’s deputy mayor for economic development.

These displaced people need housing and income. While the city has been able to provide temporary shelter through renovated dormitories, like the one Mr. Kachanovskyy lives in, jobs have proved more difficult.

On the official regional job center registry, there are only 10,000 available positions, says Orest Hryniv, deputy head of the Lviv region’s department of economic policy. More can be found on online platforms, he says, but there is still a large gap between job needs and job openings. Even those who do get work may find themselves making wages that are unsustainably low. About 41% of the jobs on the official registry are in the service economy.

“The salaries that people receive in these jobs are not [high enough to] help people to afford the renting and also to take care of their families,” says Mr. Hryniv.

Meanwhile, the streets of Lviv are busy and businesses are open – though they’re often powered by generators humming outside. Souvenir shops sell patriotic tchotchkes, from mugs adorned with Molotov cocktails (“Smoothie, Ukrainian Style,” they read) to traditional Ukrainian garb. Street markets for groceries and other goods are still active. Operating shops suggest consumer demand, and disposable income.

Regardless, that income has lost much of its value in a year of rapid inflation. Mr. Kachanovskyy, speaking on the ground floor of the dormitory as students pass in and out, says much of his family’s monthly budget is spent on food and fuel, both of which have become more expensive.

“I don’t know when this will be over,” he says, “and the prices will be rising for sure again.”

Nationwide, the war has forced the Ukrainian government to budget tightly. Mr. Moskalenko says the military, critical infrastructure, and hospitals occupy almost all of Lviv’s spending, just as they do nationally. Inflation has made those budget decisions more difficult. Already, he says, there have been government layoffs.

Noah Robertson/The Christian Science Monitor View caption Hide caption Oleh Risny's second-floor office at the Lviv, Ukraine, state employment center is filled with plaques, flags, stamps, and memorabilia kept in a corner armoire, Dec. 1, 2022. Mr. Risny mostly sees women coming to his office, since many men are reluctant to register as unemployed out of fear of conscription.

“We can survive”

Just blocks away from the college dormitory is the Lviv employment center, housed in a large administrative building. In the atrium is a series of standing bulletin boards, advertising openings and training opportunities – many that the region will subsidize – across different industries. Aside from employees, the building is almost empty.

On the second floor, Oleh Risny, head of the employment center, sits at a large desk next to a conference table and Ukrainian flag. Since the start of the war, he says, government unemployment benefits have fallen in amount and length – from nine to now three months. That’s meant fewer people visiting centers like his, atop of other factors such as men fearing conscription if they register as unemployed. The lack of visitors is “not about a good economic situation,” he says. “It’s about changing legislation.”

Ukraine already had problems in taxing its unofficial economy, he says, which makes up a large share of employment around the country. Those have grown more acute during the war, when tax revenues are scarcer. Other offices like his have lost 30% to 40% of their staff in short spans. They’re bracing for something similar, says Mr. Risny.

“But we understand why it is,” he says. “We can survive.”

So can Mr. Kachanovskyy. “We are very glad for these conditions,” he says. He, his wife, his son, his daughter-in-law, and his two grandchildren split two rooms upstairs – though his daughter-in-law just left to work abroad and his son, who registered as unemployed months ago, hasn’t been able to find a job.

He, like many other Ukrainians, lived through the 1990s, when a toddling independent government mismanaged the economy into crisis. Industrial production and GDP losses were higher than America’s during the Great Depression. In 1994 alone, GDP fell by 23%.

“I am sure that the ’90s were worse than this,” says Mr. Kachanovskyy, who worked multiple jobs and sold personal possessions just to get through. Now he has his family with him, he has his needs met, and he has a job that keeps him from going crazy, he says.

McCarthy meet, with high stakes for the U.S. economy

President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are meeting to see if they can break the impasse on spending cuts as the deadline to lift the debt ceiling draws ever closer.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

President Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy met this afternoon looking to break an impasse over raising the debt limit. The meeting opened on an optimistic note. Biden says he thinks they can reach a deal before the government runs out of money to pay its bills.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We still have some disagreements, but I think we may be able to get where we have to go.

SHAPIRO: NPR's Franco Ordoñez is covering these talks from the White House. Franco, what's the latest on the state of play?

FRANCO ORDOÑEZ, BYLINE: Well, Ari, the meeting lasted just over an hour. And when they came out, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he called it the best meeting they've had on the issue.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

KEVIN MCCARTHY: I believe we can get it done.

ORDOÑEZ: You know, the tone was really different. I mean, it was very positive. Both leaders said they think they can reach a deal before the government runs out of money.

SHAPIRO: That is a shift. Leading up to this meeting, there were a lot of stops and starts. This weekend, things came to a halt. Does it seem like a breakthrough?

ORDOÑEZ: You know, it is positive, but it's really too soon to tell for sure. But they told staff to continue talking to find common ground. And McCarthy says staff will work through the night, and he says he thinks that he and Biden will talk every day now. And Biden said at the start of the meeting that he said it's time for both sides to find compromise.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BIDEN: We have to be in a position where we can sell it to our constituencies. We're pretty well divided in the House, almost down the middle, and it's not any different in the Senate. So we've got to get something we can sell to both sides.

SHAPIRO: Franco, are there any areas where it's clear the two sides are not in sync right now?

ORDOÑEZ: Well, the White House has proposed keeping spending flat this year and next. And Biden wants to look at tax revenue as a way to reduce debt, but McCarthy ruled that out flat out.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MCCARTHY: The problem is - is not revenue. The problem is spending. So if you want to know where our differences have been, it's always been the same place.

ORDOÑEZ: And he's continuing to say that the government needs to spend less than it did last year. He's calling for a lot of different spending cuts, and he also wants more work requirements to limit federal aid to programs like Medicaid. After the meeting, Biden acknowledged that there were still some disagreements but said in a statement that the only way to move forward is with a bipartisan agreement.

SHAPIRO: There are big economic consequences to a default, as we have discussed in other parts of the show. Politically, though, who has more to lose if the government defaults on its debts?

ORDOÑEZ: I mean, look, it's clear that both Biden and McCarthy are trying to avoid any type of blame. McCarthy needs to keep the right flank of his party happy, or he could really lose his speakership. And for Biden, you know, he's very concerned because the economy, while this is an issue that he blames on Congress for not, you know, doing its congressional duty in passing the debt limit - this economy, whether he likes it or not, is basically his. He's the president. And he's also running for reelection in 2024, and he knows that voters will hold him accountable for the economy when their vote comes up. So there is a lot riding on this deal.

SHAPIRO: That is NPR's Franco Ordoñez covering every twist and turn of the debt ceiling talks from his perch at the White House. Franco, thank you for the update.

ORDOÑEZ: Thank you, Ari.

Aug 09 2023,‘Time to look forward’: Kotek co-chairs new task force to revamp Portland’s economy,KOIN 6,center,https://koin.com/news/portland/time-to-look-forward-kotek-co-chairs-new-task-force-to-revamp-portlands-economy,"PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek announced the new Portland Central City Task Force on Wednesday in an effort to revitalize Portland’s economic future.

The governor said she is partnering with the Oregon Business Council to gather local elected officials along with business and community leaders to “tackle issues impacting the economic future of Portland’s Central City.”

Kotek and Dan McMillan – the president and CEO of The Standard – will co-chair the task force. The task force will include five committees including Vision & Value; Clean Streets; Crime & Vandalism; Unsheltered Homelessness and Tax Competitiveness.

Kotek said full task force membership will be announced at a later date.

“It’s no secret that downtown Portland has faced an onslaught of challenges in recent years that have tarnished some of the characteristics that people love about Oregon’s largest city,” Kotek said in a press release. “Growing pains turned into crises, exacerbated by a global pandemic, and now concerns about Portland have become a statewide economic issue. It’s time to look forward, bring together diverse voices, and focus our energy on developing concrete and equitable solutions. I want to thank everyone who believes in Portland and is committed to building a brighter future, whether you’re a member of this task force or doing great work elsewhere.”

The governor said she started the task force “in response to a clear mandate” from Portlanders and Oregonians to address issues in the city.

Brad Popic of the Portland Outdoor Store told KOIN 6 they have been telling city leaders about these problems for a while now, so he hopes if any change happens– it happens fast.

“They’ve had enormous meetings and conversations and people are on the TV and on the radio and in person and texting. And it’s the same thing over and over again,” Popic said. “And there just seems to be a lack of speed when it comes to answering all these questions.”

“We are thankful to have a strong and willing partner in Governor Kotek working with the business community, local officials and nonprofit leaders to create actionable steps to ensure downtown Portland’s future prosperity,” Co-Chair McMillan said. “We’re gradually seeing increased foot traffic, a decrease in property crime and boarded windows coming down. It’s time to seize the moment and write the next chapter for our beloved city, together.”

The first task force meeting will be held Aug. 22, followed by another meeting in October, according to Kotek’s office. The task force will also present recommendations at the Oregon Business Plan Leadership Summit in December.

“I’m sure we can all win awards for the amount of meetings we’ve had about fixing problems, but what this is about is action because we have the leaders of the governments sitting side by side with the business community,” said Portland Metro Chamber President and CEO Andrew Hoan. “This is about learning together, fixing the problems together.”

Mayor Ted Wheeler issued a statement in response to the task force’s implementation.

“Revitalizing Portland’s central city, an area disproportionally impacted by the biggest issues facing our community today, is a top priority for my administration, the City Council, and the City of Portland,” Wheeler said. “As outlined in our Central City plan, we have and will continue to redouble our efforts to increase public safety and security patrols, created centralized teams focused on trash cleanup, graffiti abatement, and unsanctioned campsite removals, and have worked closely with business owners and residents to get them connected to resources they need most."
Mar 13 2023,Silicon Valley Bank collapse could impact Boston economy,CBS News (Online),left,https://cbsnews.com/boston/news/collapse-silicon-valley-bank-impact-boston-economy,"BOSTON -- It's being called the second largest bank failure in US history. Now the government is stepping in to help customers of Silicon Valley Bank.

""On Friday the FDIC took control of Silicon Valley's assets. Over the weekend, took control of Signature Bank's assets,"" says President Joe Biden. ""Americans can have confidence that the banking systems is safe. Your deposits will be there when you need them.""

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of the bank following its collapse last week. President Biden announced that the government will protect all depositors in the bank whether they are insured or not. Financial experts say the move helped to calm the banking industry, but some regional banks are still seeing stock prices plummet.

""We are seeing significant movement from people taking money from small regional banks, especially banks that had significant exposure to technology,"" explains Larry Glazer, Managing Partner with Mayflower Advisors. His team has been fielding calls from concerned clients all weekend.

Glazer fears more banks could fall, especially if they invest heavily in the tech sector like Silicon Valley Bank. The fallout from this may force larger banking institutions to second guess lending to tech companies.

""That growth in technology, coupled with the rapid rise of interest rates for certain financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank, led to significant losses in their bond portfolios. The biotech community, technology community, Silicon Valley Bank banked reportedly half of all startups in this country. [This includes] many startups in and around the greater Boston area,"" adds Glazer. ""We could see other banks forced to merge, forced to collapse. Many of these have a significant presence in the Boston area. Boston is the second most impacted economy as a result of this banking fallout. There are other banks with a presence in Boston whose stocks are down precipitously today. Those are the most concerning today.""

Consumers should figure out if their bank is FDIC insured. If they are, Glazer says people will want to stay under the $250,000 insurance protection cap from the FDIC. Anyone with more than that in the bank may want to diversify their extra cash into other banks. He also says there may be a silver lining to this situation.

""For consumers, interest rates have declined significantly over the last few days as a fallout from Silicon Bank,"" Glazer said. ""May mean mortgage rates come down, credit yields moderate, so that's a good thing for financial markets."""
Apr 27 2023,Economy grew by 1.1% in first quarter of 2023 despite rising rates,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-grew-by-1-1-in-first-quarter-of-2023-despite-rising-rates,"

Economic growth slowed to 1.1% in the first quarter of this year, down from 2.6% the quarter before, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday morning.

Economists had expected gross domestic product growth to increase by 2%, so the preliminary report is weaker than forecast. Still, details of the report indicated some resilience in the face of several major headwinds. Most notably, consumer spending accelerated to a strong 3.7% annual rate.



EXISTING HOME SALES FALL AND PRICES DROP AMID WORSENING HOUSING ROUT



“The focus is on the weak top-line number, but the economy remains resilient, especially consumer spending,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “Given consumer spending is about 70% of the economy, first quarter GDP shows an economy still expanding, but slowing. That inventories dropped dramatically also shows consumer strength and that businesses have underestimated both consumer buying and business buying.”

The GDP numbers, which are adjusted for inflation, represent the government’s preliminary estimate — the first of three revisions that will be made over the coming months as analysts get a better picture of how the economy performed from the start of the year through March.

The first-quarter growth came as the Federal Reserve increased its interest rate target, an action meant to slow economic activity.

Other details of the report hinted at underlying health in commerce. The headline GDP growth rate would have been more than 2 full percentage points higher if not for a sharp decrease in inventories, but inventories are not predictive of growth. Final sales to domestic private purchasers grew at a nearly 3% rate, suggesting that trend growth is higher than the headline number.

Still, even though Thursday’s preliminary reading was in the black, most economists expect GDP growth to fall off as the year drags on and economic conditions darken. Many, including Fed staff, are forecasting at least a mild recession later this year.

The first-quarter GDP numbers follow positive GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year.

The economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate from October through the end of last year. Still, household spending and business investment slowed to end the year.

For all of 2022, the economy grew 2.1%. The year was marked first by recession fears and then by the biggest surge of inflation in decades, which prompted an intense campaign by the Federal Reserve to ease price pressures through interest rate hikes.

The Fed once again hiked interest rates last month by a modest degree, even despite growing uncertainty in the banking sector. And investors overwhelmingly expect another quarter percentage point rate revision a week from now when Fed officials next meet.

That rate hike would come amid signs the labor market is finally softening in response to the year of monetary tightening."
Mar 07 2023,Powell signals increased rate hikes if economy stays strong,Boston Herald,right,https://bostonherald.com/2023/03/07/powell-signals-increased-rate-hikes-if-economy-stays-strong,"By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER (AP Economics Writer)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve could increase the size of its interest rate hikes and raise borrowing costs to higher levels than previously projected if evidence continues to point to a robust economy and persistently high inflation, Chair Jerome Powell told a Senate panel Tuesday.

“The latest economic data have come in stronger than expected, which suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated,” Powell testified to the Senate Banking Committee. “If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

Powell’s comments reflect a sharp change in the economic outlook since the Fed’s most recent policy meeting in early February. At that meeting, the central bank raised its key rate by just a quarter-point, downshifting after a half-point rise in December and four three-quarter-point hikes before that.

The Fed chair’s remarks Tuesday raised the real possibility that the Fed will increase its benchmark rate by a half-percentage point at its next meeting March 21-22. Over the past year, the central bank has raised its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, eight times.

At their forthcoming meeting, Fed officials will also issue updated forecasts for how high they expect their benchmark rate to ultimately reach. In December, they forecast that it would reach about 5.1% later this year. Powell’s latest remarks suggested that the Fed could raise it even higher. Futures pricing indicates that investors now expect it to rise a half-point further, to 5.6%.

The Fed chair’s warning of potentially more aggressive moves darkened the mood on Wall Street, where stock prices tumbled in the hours after Powell began speaking. In late-day trading, the broad S&P 500 index was down a sizable 1.6%.

“The presumption that’s been established is that they will hike (a half-point) in March, unless they are convinced otherwise,” said Derek Tang, an economist at LHMeyer, an economic consulting firm.

The prospect of increasingly high borrowing costs tends to generate concern among economists and investors. Rising rates can not only cool consumer and business spending, weaken growth and slow inflation; they can also send the economy sliding into a recession.

During Tuesday’s hearing, Democratic senators stressed their belief that today’s high inflation is due mainly to the combination of continued supply chain disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and higher corporate profit margins. Several argued that further rate hikes would throw millions of Americans out of work.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, noted that Fed officials have projected that the unemployment rate will reach 4.6% by the end of this year, from 3.4% now. Historically, when the jobless rate has risen by at least 1 percentage point, a recession has followed, she noted.

“If you could speak directly to the 2 million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you’re planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them?” Warren asked.

“We actually don’t think that we need to see a sharp or enormous increase in unemployment to get inflation under control,” Powell responded. “We’re not targeting any of that.”

By contrast, the committee’s Republicans mainly blamed President Joe Biden’s policies for high inflation and argued that if government spending were cut, inflation would slow.

“If Congress reduced the rate of growth in its spending, and reduced the rate of growth in its debt accumulation, it would make your job easier in reducing inflation?” Sen. John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, asked.

“I don’t think fiscal policy right now is a big factor driving inflation,” Powell responded. But he also acknowledged that if Congress reduced the deficit, that “could” help slow price increases.

Powell walked back some of the optimistic comments about declining inflation he had made after the Fed’s Feb. 1 meeting, when he noted that “the disinflationary process has started” and he referred to “disinflation” — a broad and steady slowdown in inflation — multiple times. At that time, year-over-year consumer price growth had slowed for six straight months.

But after that meeting, the latest reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed that consumer prices rose from December to January by the most in seven months. And reports on hiring, consumer spending and the broader economy have also indicated that growth remains healthy.

Such economic figures, Powell said Tuesday, “have partly reversed the softening trends that we had seen in the data just a month ago.”

The Fed chair also said that inflation “has been moderating in recent months” but added that “the process of getting inflation back down to 2 percent has a long way to go and is likely to be bumpy.” Inflation, as measured year over year, has slowed from its peak in June of 9.1% to 6.4%.

Several Fed officials said last week that they would favor raising the Fed’s key rate above the 5.1% level they had projected in December if growth and inflation stay elevated.

Powell noted that so far, most of the slowdown in inflation reflects an unraveling of supply chains that have allowed more furniture, clothes, semiconductors and other physical goods to reach U.S. shores. By contrast, inflation pressures remain entrenched in numerous areas of the economy’s vast service sector.

Rental and housing costs, for example, remain a significant driver of inflation. At the same time, the cost of a new apartment lease is growing much more slowly, a trend that should reduce housing inflation by mid-year, Powell has said.

But the prices of many services — from dining out to hotel rooms to haircuts — are still rising rapidly, with little sign that the Fed’s rate hikes are having an effect. Fed officials say the costs of those services mainly reflect rising wages and salaries, which companies often pass on to their customers in the form of higher prices.

As a result, the Fed’s monetary policy report to Congress, which it publishes in conjunction with the chair’s testimony, said that quelling inflation will likely require “softer labor market conditions” — a euphemism for fewer job openings and more layoffs.

Senators from both parties also asked Powell about the Fed’s view on cryptocurrencies and what steps it has taken as a financial regulator on digital assets.

“What we see is, you know, quite a lot of turmoil,” Powell said. “We see fraud, we see a lack of transparency, we see run risk, lots and lots of things like that.”

As a result, Powell said, the Fed is encouraging the banks it oversees to take “great care in the ways that they engage with the whole crypto space.”

At the same time, he said, “We have to be open to the idea that somewhere in there, there’s technology that can be featured in productive innovation that makes people’s lives better.”"
Mar 08 2023,Fed Chair Predicts Rough Ride Ahead for US Economy,CBN,right,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2023/march/powell-signals-increased-rate-hikes-if-economy-stays-strong,"The Federal Reserve Chair told members of Congress it could be a ""bumpy"" ride as they continue to try and get inflation under control.

Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed's goal was still to get inflation down to 2%. The Fed has raised interest rates multiple times over the past year to try and help cool inflation, and Powell says that may need to happen at a faster rate because inflation is still out of control.

""If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we'd be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes,"" Powell told the U.S. Senate.

Consumer spending and economic data have both been stronger than expected start to 2023, but inflation has remained stubbornly high. The Fed's outlook for the remainder of the year projects an unemployment rate of around 4.6% by the end of 2023. That number is more than a full point higher than what it is now.

""Chair Powell if you could speak directly to the 2 million hard-working people who have decent jobs who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them? How would you explain your view that they need to lose their jobs?"" asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).

""I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is extremely high and it's hurting the working people of this country badly, all of them, not just 2 million of them, but all of them are suffering under high inflation. And we're taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down,"" Powell replied.

The focus on the economy extended beyond Capitol Hill. The House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing in Oklahoma where business owners talked about the economic squeeze they're feeling.

""We've seen firsthand how out of control costs have gotten in the last several years. Equipment costs have doubled, if you were to construct our building today it would cost at least twice as much, and for supplies we face both rising freight costs and parts on backorder being commonplace,"" said Bryan Jackson to the committee. Jackson is a military veteran who owns a meat-packing company in Oklahoma.

Powell told senators in blunt terms that Congress needs to raise the debt ceiling or risk long-term harm to the economy. He faces more tough questions on Capitol Hill this week as he sits in front of a House panel Wednesday.

SALT LAKE CITY — The latest assessment of U.S. economic growth came up short of expectations on Thursday, fueling further predictions that a recession looms on the near-term horizon.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis found the country's real gross domestic product output for the first quarter of 2023 grew at an annual rate of 1.1%, well short of the expected 2% and down from the 2.6% rate of 2022's fourth quarter.

Robust consumer spending helped drive growth over the last three months but a suppressed housing market and decreases in business investments in inventory and production equipment — a metric that reflects diminished operator expectations — drove overall growth down from the previous quarter.

While the Federal Reserve's nine straight increases to its benchmark lending rate are showing some impacts as the cost of borrowing is well up over a year ago, and the recent tumult in the U.S. banking sector is expected to tighten the issuance of credit, the Commerce Department also found prices for goods and services are still rising at a brisk clip.

The report found personal consumption expenditures were up 3.7% in the first quarter of the year, the fastest pace since the second quarter of 2021. That spending rate is being fueled by healthy wage growth that moved up by almost $280 billion in the first three months of 2023, according to the report.

Overall annual U.S. inflation came in at 5% in March, according to the latest data from the Labor Department, down a full percentage point from February and the lowest year-over-year rate in almost two years.

But core inflation, a metric that strips out volatile food and energy costs and a data point closely watched by the Federal Reserve, saw a 0.4% increase from February and at 5.6% is now outstripping headline inflation for the first time since early 2021.

So, what does it all mean?

The combination of inflation still running well north of the Fed's target rate of 2%, combined with business slowdowns, is a bellwether for a looming recession, according to many economists.

""The economy had less forward momentum at the start of this year than previously thought,"" Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics wrote in a research note, per The Associated Press. ""We continue to expect the drag from higher interest rates and tightening credit conditions to push the economy into a mild recession soon.""

The Federal Reserve's Open Markets Committee is set to meet next week and is widely expected to assess another .25% hike to its overnight lending rate, matching the last increase in March and a move that would mark the 10th straight increase for the monetary body.

Interest rate adjustments are the primary tool wielded by the Fed in chasing its dual mandate of maintaining maximum employment and price stability. But its series of rate hikes over the last year were one of the factors hurting Silicon Valley Bank , which last month became the second-biggest U.S. bank failure in history. Bonds owned by it and other banks have seen their prices fall as interest rates rose sharply.

Some general tips on preparing for a recession:

Most importantly, don't panic. Yes, prices for basic necessities have skyrocketed and no one is predicting that will dissipate anytime soon. Yes, the Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates and the cost of debt is on the rise. And, yes, opening recent 401(k) investment statements has likely been a gasp-inducing exercise.

But the expert advice is to keep cool and don't be tempted to react by liquidating current investments as a tactic to avoid further losses. A recession could be in store, but they're typically short-lived (the last one, amid the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, only lasted three months). The same is true for bear markets. And the recoveries that come on the back end of inflationary/recessionary periods create the best opportunities, in terms of gains, for those who stay the course.

Address personal debt, especially the high-interest variety. The gist of the Fed's interest rate hike strategy is to make credit and debt more expensive which, theoretically, discourages spending and slows down the economy. So, any outstanding debt you're currently carrying that has a high fixed rate, or a floating rate that will track up with the Fed's adjustments, needs priority attention. Credit cards are typically the worst in this category.

""Job number one for anyone with a credit card is to pay off their balances as soon as possible,"" Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, told The Washington Post. ""When a recession may be on the way and interest rates are rising rapidly, it's even more important.""

Stash that cash, but not under the bed. Financial advisers suggest we should all have savings in reserve that can cover three to six months of our living expenses. Easier said than done and particularly so for individuals and families that may already be scraping to keep up with big recent jumps in the cost of basic necessities.

The upside to recent increases in borrowing rates is upward movement (though not a lot) in saving vehicles like bonds or certificates of deposit, though savers should be thoughtful about how much cash to lock up in time-constrained accounts.

Make a plan, and do it now. Preparation for a harder slog is critical, but you should also be ready to navigate worst-case scenarios. What would be your first step after an unexpected job loss? Can you make budget adjustments now, ahead of any potential future economic deterioration, to be in a better position to weather the storm?

""I like to think of this weird, uncertain period as an opportunity to be proactive,"" Farnoosh Torabi, an editor-at-large at CNET Money, told The Cut. ""We can still make moves now without the real pressures that come with a recession like unemployment or a loss of income.""

It’s a time of still-high inflation but continued low unemployment that gives both Republicans and Democrats ammunition to frame an issue that polls show is the most important in the election .

President Biden sought to reshape the fight over branding the economy Wednesday with a major address co-opting the media-created term “Bidenomics,” hoping to counter Republican efforts since 2021 to blame him for fast-rising prices that have sharply increased Americans’ cost of living.

By fully embracing the label Bidenomics — a word plastered in capital letters around the stage at his Chicago event — Biden is taking ownership of the state of the economy, betting there won’t be a recession before the election, or at least not a deep one. He also is hoping he can do a better job selling his administration’s efforts to improve the lives of low- and middle-income Americans than he has so far and reverse Americans’ consistently negative views of his handling of the economy.

Biden sought to do that Wednesday by contrasting his economic philosophy with what he called the Republican “trickle-down” approach that focuses on reducing taxes for the wealthy and large corporations, theoretically to boost jobs and growth. That philosophy took hold in the 1980s with another lasting brand — Reaganomics.

“Bidenomics is about building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down,” Biden said in a speech at Chicago’s Old Post Office, giving an official name to the credo he has emphasized since his 2020 campaign.

He said there are three facets of his economic philosophy: investing in key American industries, such as clean energy and semiconductor manufacturing; educating and empowering workers; and promoting competition to lower costs. Biden highlighted legislation enacted during his presidency, such as the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law that is paying for thousands of new construction projects, and a bill that reduces the cost of prescription drugs, that are helping fulfill those goals. He noted the record 13 million jobs created since he took office and that the annual rate of inflation is now less than half the four-decade high set a year ago.

Touting his accomplishments is crucial for Biden’s reelection, and the speech is part of an administration wide effort over the coming months, according to a memo this week from two top White House advisers. A poll released Wednesday from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed just 34 percent of adults approve of his handling of the economy, which is significantly below his low overall approval rating.

“He’s not getting the credit with the voters that he deserves for the strength of the American economy today,” said Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg, who called the economic focus “a welcome development.” “I think it’s important that voters have a better understanding of the progress that we’ve made in this country coming out of a very difficult period.”

But Biden’s gamble comes with risks. Inflation remains elevated and the Federal Reserve’s effort to bring it down through higher interest rates has slowed economic growth and risks pushing the country into a recession. On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there is a “significant probability” the country is headed toward a recession, although he doesn’t think that’s the most likely case.

Republicans have pounded away on Biden, blaming the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill he championed in his first weeks in office as sparking a surge in prices that they labeled Bidenflation. Many economists agree the spending helped cause inflation to flare in 2021, but rapid price growth has also been fueled by supply chain problems and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Regardless, Republicans continue to stress the harm inflation is causing to average Americans and dismissed Bidenomics as political spin.

“It’s not a coherent philosophy in my view at all. Most of it is messaging,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative-leaning American Action Forum think tank and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. “They’re trying to put together the largest lipstick that has ever been created to make it look good.”

Economists have been predicting an approaching recession for more than a year, but have also repeatedly delayed when that would happen. Holtz-Eakin put the odds of a recession at greater than 50 percent, predicting a mild one will hit toward the end of this year and last about six months. Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, an insurance and financial services company, said there is at least a 70 percent chance of a recession before the election.

“Consumers may not be feeling as happy and as good as the Biden administration would want because of inflation,” she said. “That’s still a tough pill for consumers to deal with.”

But she said Biden has accomplishments worth highlighting and the economy has proved to be surprisingly resilient in the face of inflation and the recent bank failures. Biden said at a fund-raiser Tuesday night that despite the constant “dire predictions” he did not think a recession was coming.

“Guess what? Bidenomics has worked,” he said in Chicago Wednesday, adding that continuing to bring down inflation remains one of his top priorities. He then stressed the Inflation Reduction Act he signed into law last year, which capped out-of-pocket insulin costs and will reduce other prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients by allowing the government for the first time to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical companies.

Biden needs to discuss his policies in more specific detail if he is to boost his approval rating on the economy, said Kristian Ramos, a senior adviser with Way to Win Action Fund, a progressive group.

The organization’s research arm recently conducted eight focus groups in English and Spanish with Latino voters in Arizona and Nevada and found the participants were “largely unaware of anything that President Biden had done to make their lives better.” But when they were told about specific Biden accomplishments, they were more likely to support Biden.

“Latinos are experiencing the benefits of these policies: ‘I’ve got a better job. I have more money.’ They are aware of these things,” Ramos said. “What President Biden is doing is saying, ‘My policies are what helped you get them and Republicans are trying to take them away.’ We have to do this for the next year and a half.”

Rosenberg, the Democratic strategist, said the substance of the message was key. While Bidenomics is a useful term, he said, the important thing is for Biden to talk about his accomplishments.

“It’s really not the label that’s going to matter. It’s the reality that the country is far better off today” than when Biden took office, Rosenberg said. “I think he’s got a good story to tell. He’s got to be aggressive about telling it.”

Amid persistent inflation, higher interest rates and recession worries, Americans have never been more negative about the economy, according to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey. A record 69% of the public holds negative views about the economy both now and in the future, the highest percentage in the survey's 17-year history. The survey of 1,000 people nationwide, with a margin of error of +/-3.1%, found that about two-thirds of Americans say their wages are falling behind inflation, and two-thirds say the nation is headed for recession or already in one. The fallout from these negative views is hitting President Joe Biden's approval rating. His overall rating fell by 2 percentage points to 39% and his disapproval rating rose by a point to 55% compared with the November survey.

Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy by a 62% to 34% margin, a deterioration from the 57% to 38% margin in the last survey. It was the second-worst reading of his presidency on the economy.

Widespread disapproval

Biden lost support from several key groups. Overall approval from Democrats dropped 2 points to 77% compared with a year ago and by 9 points for independents to just 27%. ""It's clear that as much as there is a partisan overlay to people's attitudes, everybody is also feeling the squeeze including Democrats and that's depressing numbers with the base,'' said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the survey's Democratic pollster.

The only silver lining, he said, is Biden has time to shore up his base before the next election. ""One group that I think is especially important to keep an eye on is women 18 to 49, a very important part of the Democratic coalition,'' said Micah Roberts, partner at Public Opinion Strategies, which serves as the survey's Republican pollster. ""They have they've seen a massive drop in terms of their economic approval."" The rating for that metric dropped 13 points compared with last quarter to 34%. There were a few bright spots in the data. Despite the negative views on the economy, 63% of employed Americans are not worried about losing jobs, up 5 points from November. And 37% of respondents expect their wages to increase in the next year, a bit above the average of the past several years. Yet most Americans don't feel their wages allow them to keep up with inflation. Just 5% say their household income is growing faster than inflation, 26% say it's keeping pace and 67% report they are falling behind.

Changing behavior

Because of inflation, large majorities say they are altering their spending and lifestyles. Fully 81% of respondents say they are taking some action, such as spending less on entertainment, traveling less or using savings to pay for purchases. The survey found that the effects are not spread out equally.

Roughly three-quarters of self-described working-class Americans say they are cutting back on entertainment and eating out to economize due to inflation; that compares with 54% of upper-middle-class Americans. Some 51% of the working class say they are working more to make ends meet, compared with just 18% of the upper middle class. Also, 24% of Black Americans say they are hit hardest by high housing prices, compared with 12% of white Americans. Overall, 54% of Americans said the rise in food prices had affected them the hardest, a percentage consistent across racial groups, political party and income, though it appears to be more acute for rural compared with urban dwellers and for women compared to men. The torrent of negative economic views spills over into American views on the stock market. Just 24% say now is a good time to invest in stocks, the lowest reading in the survey's 17-year history. The prior record was last quarter at 26%. But 1 in 5 adults have taken some action to benefit from higher rates, either moving bank accounts, buying a money market fund or purchasing a CD. A majority of Americans say they are less likely to buy a car or a new home due to higher interest rates."
Feb 26 2023,America’s economy is splitting consumers into two very different realities,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/02/25/two-realities-economy-inflation-consumer-spending-recession/,"Despite near record inflation, consistent recession predictions, and rising borrowing costs, Americans continue to do what they do best—spend. Even if it means leaning on savings and credit cards, all income brackets have been taking vacations and eating out at restaurants.

To the surprise of many forecasters, real personal spending rose 1.1% in January, according to the Federal Reserve’s favorite gauge. But economists fear that with interest rates set to remain “higher for longer,” and inflation proving to be stubborn, lower and middle income consumers are beginning to feel pinched. That means we could be headed for a world where the American consumer splits into two very different camps: one for the wealthy and one for the working class.

Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, told Fortune that he expects to see a “K-shaped consumer spending pattern” this year where working class families slow their spending as the rising cost of living takes its toll, while wealthy families continue to splurge, “albeit with more discretion.”

He predicts that consumer spending will rise just 1% this year—after a 2.8% increase in 2022 and a 9.1% jump in 2021—arguing that hiring will slow “meaningfully” and economic uncertainty will increase, making households pull back.

“We’re still in an environment where high inflation and high interest rates are a constraint on many families. And if you look at household balance sheets, they’re in worse shape than they were even six months ago,” he said.

The Outlook: A tale of two economies

White collar layoffs have captured headlines in recent months, as Big Tech giants continue to let go of tens of thousands of employees, but wealthy Americans have a few key advantages that allow them to keep spending during tough times in a way lower-income consumers can’t.

Daco explained that white collar workers tend to have sizable savings, receive large severance packages, and get new jobs fairly easily.

“In the tech sector, for instance—and even for some financial sector employees—reemployment is much easier, either in the same sector, or in different sectors,” he said. “So an engineer that works at a big tech firm can find a job at a consulting company. Somebody that works in investment banking can find a job at another investment bank, or wealth management or financial services company. They have a little bit more flexibility.”

Lower-income Americans, on the other hand, are often forced to turn to debt when they lose their jobs or face rising costs. New data from Bankrate shows 82% of people earning less than $50,000 can’t cover one month’s worth of expenses without using credit. And some 36% of Americans now have more credit card debt than emergency savings, the most since 2011.

“It’s clear that the less-than-optimal economy, including historically high inflation coupled with rising interest rates, has taken a double-edged toll on Americans,” Mark Hamrick, Bankrate’s senior economic analyst, said of the findings. “Many have resorted to tapping their emergency savings if they have it, or have taken on credit card debt, or some combination.”

U.S. credit card balances soared 15% in 2022 and 7% in the fourth quarter alone to a record $986 billion, according to the New York Fed’s quarterly Household Debt and Credit Report—and delinquency rates are rising.

On top of that, Goldman Sach estimated earlier this month that Americans have spent over 35% of the $2.7 trillion in excess savings they built up during the pandemic—when spending slowed and stimulus checks and enhanced unemployment benefits boosted incomes. And the top 10% of earners got more than half that money anyway.

“We’re no longer in an environment where excess savings are going to be the Savior or where one can expect ongoing exceptional job and wage growth,” Daco said. “The elements of support for consumer spending, especially for those at the lower end of the income spectrum, are not going to be as strong through the rest of the year.”

With Americans’ wealth fading due to falling stock prices and declining home values as well, Daco sees “a multi-speed consumer spending outlook” as lower income consumers pull back this year while wealthier Americans will continue to travel and eat out.

An unclear timeline

Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Asset Management, told Fortune that he also believes U.S. consumers are splitting into two distinct groups, but he noted that, overall, consumers’ finances remain in good shape.

“I think that it is certainly possible that we could get that K-shaped type of spending phenomenon,” he said. “But the evidence right now does not suggest the consumer is in a really difficult spot. We would anticipate that worsening and weakening as the year goes on, but I think it’s gonna have to be a later this year story, as opposed to a right here and now story.”

Both Daco and Freedman agreed consumer spending is set to drop, but by how much will depend on the labor market. Freedman believes that although employment trends are “softening,” unless the unemployment rate rises sharply, consumer spending will remain strong at least until later this year.

But Daco noted that before January’s blowout jobs report—which pushed the unemployment rate to a 53-year low of 3.4%—hiring was slowing, and seasonal adjustments that were made to last month’s employment data might have given an overly optimistic picture of the labor market.

“We also have to note that these readings tend to be quite volatile,” he said. “There’s a big margin of error there. So yes, perhaps the labor market is still much stronger than we anticipated. But I would seriously doubt that it’s that much stronger given our conversations with business executives in various sectors.”

Business leaders Daco spoke with recently didn’t have the “desire” to keep hiring or increase wages as fast as they have this past year either. To his point, some 61% of business leaders said they’re expecting layoffs at their companies this year in a recent ResumeBuilder survey.

“What we’re hearing is the desire to rethink the proper and ideal size of one’s talent pool, rethink hiring decisions, and rethink wage growth and benefits growth in the current environment,” he said. “So there’s really much more of a focus on cost and to me that would signal further weakening of consumer spending.”

Implications for the economy and investors

Consumer spending makes up roughly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, so if it does slow dramatically, it will have big implications for the economy and investors. But while many billionaire investors and business leaders believe this means a recession is all but guaranteed, EY Parthenon’s Daco isn’t so sure.

He argues that the outlook for the U.S. economy is “uncertain” and while it could be headed for a “mild recession,” he doesn’t see “broad-based layoffs” as likely. And U.S Bank Asset Management’s Freedman doesn’t foresee an outright recession either.

“Our economics team is calling for a slowdown, but not a recession,” he said. “We think that it’s going to probably be a longer slowdown, if you will, but not necessarily a deep slowdown.”

For investors, the CIO said he was a “big fan” of the infrastructure and utilities sectors, which should benefit from recent legislation, and argued tech stocks may be a good long term investment, but it’s not a good time to buy. Like other Wall Street investors, Freedman also pointed to the value of simply holding cash in the form of U.S. treasuries due to the risky economic environment.

“You can invest in six month treasuries that yield over 5.07%. That’s a pretty significant hurdle for investors to move away from,” he said. “It’s an absolute real yield. That’s attractive, no doubt.”"
Oct 07 2017,This Economy is 'Trump Strong',Townhall,right,https://townhall.com/columnists/wayneallynroot/2017/10/07/this-economy-is-trump-strong-n2391836,"There's been a lot of negative stories in the news. Have you noticed?

America needs to heal. We have suffered four consecutive body blows in the past six weeks. Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria and now the Vegas mass murder. The media lives by the mantra “If it bleeds, it leads.” And they have served us nonstop headlines of crisis, death, and destruction.

But amidst all these negative headlines, we missed some remarkable positive economic news. What Vegas and America need now is some great news. The kind of news that makes you smile and pound your fist in the air. And I’ve got it.

At least IF you’re a Trump Fan. The rest of you might want to run and hide now.

Donald Trump has already produced arguably the greatest economic results in American history. You might have missed that in the media. But here are the facts.

First, Trump’s remarkable stock market performance. The DOW has risen almost 25% since Election Day. That’s an increase of over 4,300 points in about 11 months. That’s the biggest increase in that period of time in the history of the stock market.

The S&P 500 has passed $20 trillion in value for the first time in history.

President Trump is also the only President in history to oversee two nine-day or longer stock rallies (where new highs are reached each day). Included in that record is the 12-day rally ending on February 28th- matching the all-time record set by President Reagan in 1987.

Since the election of President Trump, the stock market has hit 63 closing highs, with 46 since Trump’s inauguration. On the other hand, Obama had exactly -0- stock market highs in his first four years in office.

In total President Trump has added over $5 trillion to the U.S. economy since his election. Remarkable. That’s called star power. That’s real hope and change.

A humble reminder- in previous RJ columns before the election, I predicted Trump would be our Reagan- the greatest economic president of our generation. As Mohammed Ali said, “It ‘aint bragging if you can back it up.”

But I’m just getting started.

Trump’s GDP. As I’ve always argued, GDP is a far more important economic indicator than the stock market. GDP is hard evidence of how “mom and pop” are doing on Main Street. Under Obama, America suffered the eight worst consecutive GDP years in history. Obama’s eight-year GDP average was 1.3%- the exact same GDP number as the period of the Great Depression.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, U.S. GDP has now been adjusted to a remarkable 3.1% growth in the second quarter (Trump’s first full quarter as president). That’s almost THREE TIMES HIGHER than Obama’s average GDP over his two terms.

That grew our total U.S. GDP to almost $20 trillion- the highest GDP in history.

Trump’s jobs explosion. President Trump added 1.33 million jobs from January through September versus Obama’s record of losing 4.59 million jobs in that same first nine months. Remarkable.

But the latest jobs report just came out on Friday. According to the Bureau of Labor Household Survey, the number of employed Americans increased by an amazing 906,000 for the month of September. But that’s not even the highlight.

Remember that almost every single job created in eight years under Obama was a crappy, low-wage, part-time job. Well under President Trump last month, full-time jobs (the kind we all want and need) increased by 935,000- the most in one month in the 21st century.

It was also one of the four highest increases in American history.

And President Trump is doing it without spending record sums of taxpayer money. Trump added $400 billion (a two percent increase) to the US debt since January. In the same time period, President Obama added $1.3 trillion debt (a 12% increase). That’s almost $1 trillion more than Trump.

Yes, here in my hometown we are “VEGAS STRONG” in the face of tragedy. But starting spreading the news...

THIS ECONOMY IS ""TRUMP STRONG."""
Dec 02 2022,"Biden sees economy avoiding recession, but risks remain",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/biden-business-economy-government-and-politics-fe5f657b036b2b612d072368584e00cd?utm_source=homepage&utm_medium=TopNews&utm_campaign=position_01,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden assured Americans on Friday that the U.S. economy is chugging along in the holiday season, but the very strength of a new jobs report showed that high inflation remains a recession threat.

At the White House, the president signed an emergency bill to avert a rail strike that he said could have caused 765,000 job losses in two weeks and plunged the country into a painful downturn. But many voters and economists still fear that a recession is nigh and the price of reducing high prices will be layoffs.

Biden pointed to the addition of 263,000 jobs in November — with the unemployment rate holding steady at 3.7% — as proof that his policies have bulked up the economy. He suggested that the major recession risk was the freight rail strike, a problem the country avoided by having Congress impose an agreement that raises pay but fails to provide the additional paid sick leave that workers demanded.

“Things are moving — they’re moving in the right direction,” Biden said. “As we go into the holiday season, here’s what this all means: The Americans are working, the economy is growing.”

White House officials do see reason for optimism. Gasoline prices are averaging $3.45 a gallon, down sharply from a June peak, according to AAA. The economy is expanding after shrinking in size during the first half of the year. And since July, workers’ average hourly earnings have been rising faster than consumer prices.

But inflation can be a game of whack-a-mole, and Friday’s employment report suggested that wage growth actually could be part of the problem.

Inflation has been something of a moving target during Biden’s presidency. Supply chain challenges and shortages pushed up prices as the country started to recover from the pandemic in 2021. Higher oil and food costs drove up inflation after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. And the jobs report showed that wage growth accelerated sharply, which could fuel inflation going forward.

The Federal Reserve is attempting to reduce inflation by raising its benchmark interest rates. That action reduces economic activity in order to bring down prices.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested the U.S. central bank might not have to raise rates as aggressively to return inflation to the 2% annual target. That comment caused the stock market to rise, only for the optimism to fizzle out on Friday as the new and revised wage data indicated the Fed might need to do more to cool the economy.

“With these revisions, the pace of wage growth is more consistent with 5% inflation than with 2% inflation,” said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, formerly the top economist in the Obama White House. “In this sense it may take a larger adjustment in labor markets than previously hoped to bring inflation down.”

The president’s key message is that his policies have helped to avoid catastrophes such as a recession caused by a rail strike. The bill he signed Friday binds rail companies and workers to a proposed settlement that was reached between the railroads and union leaders in September but rejected by the workers of some unions.

“The bill I’m about to sign ends a difficult rail dispute and helps our nation avoid what without a doubt would have been an economic catastrophe at a very bad time in the calendar,” said Biden. He said his team helped negotiate a “good product, but we still have more work to do in my view.”

Members of four of the 12 unions involved had rejected the proposed contract as lacking sufficient paid sick leave, setting up the possibility of a strike beginning Dec. 9. Biden acknowledged the shortcoming and said he would continue to push for that benefit for every U.S. worker.

“I’ve supported paid sick leave for a long time,” said the president, a staunch labor union supporter. “I’m going to continue that fight until we succeed.”

He said that Republican lawmakers blocked the inclusion of seven days of paid sick leave in the agreement, and it’s unclear how he would get backing for expanding family leave to all workers with the GOP winning the House majority in November’s elections.

Republican leaders have tapped into deep doubts about the U.S. economy with party officials noting that higher prices have caused Americans’ savings rate to hit the lowest level in 17 years. About three-quarters of voters last month called economic conditions “poor” or “not so good,” according to AP VoteCast.

Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the ranking Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, called the jobs report a “nightmare before Christmas.”

“The White House is absolutely clueless about the very real labor shortage still hurting Main Street businesses and driving prices higher,” Brady said. “And for many workers, they are struggling with real wage losses and real pay cuts, making sticker shock a big part of this year’s holiday gift shopping experience.”

Although Biden has said the economy is heading in the right direction, the employment report indicates that it’s on a “more muddled path” in which it’s unclear whether a downturn and eventual job losses can be averted, said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at Glassdoor, an employment website.

The mixed signals come in part because the employment report comes from two surveys. The survey of employer payrolls shows how many jobs were added, while a separate survey of households determines the unemployment rate.

The two surveys have diverged with the household numbers indicating the economy has actually lost jobs over the past two months, contradicting the gains seen in the establishments survey.

Zhao said the economy doesn’t look as though it is about to tip into recession, but the risk is that when job figures are revised next year policymakers could learn in hindsight that the U.S. was shedding jobs as the Fed continued to raise rates.

“These surveys are out of sync at a critical turning point in the economy,” he said."
Aug 08 2022,Kelly Evans: The completely misunderstood U.S. economy,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/kelly-evans-the-completely-misunderstood-us-economy.html,"The only thing I'd say about Friday's incredibly strong jobs report is that it makes far more sense that it was strong than that it would have been extremely weak. And anyone who is confused that it was strong is really confused in a much larger sense about what's actually going on with this economy.

The U.S. economy is and has been running too hot and not too cold. Think about it this way: Nominal GDP - Inflation = Real GDP. Inflation has been hitting 9% in recent months, which itself is evidence that we are running too hot, because if it were just a food/energy/supply chain/Ukraine story, high prices in those areas would, all else equal, create lower prices elsewhere. Instead, we have a massive rise in the entire, broad price level.

Anyhow, point being, if inflation is 9%, think about just how high nominal GDP has to be running in order to keep real GDP positive. Very, very high, is the answer. Last year, for example, nominal GDP surged 10.1%. In the fourth quarter alone, it soared a massive, mind-boggling, 14.5% (annualized)! How on God's green Earth is the U.S. economy exploding with that kind of ""growth""? Because of the massive Fed and fiscal stimulus that poured into the pandemic-hit economy.

The problem is, and here's where those who say the economy is actually very weak are in some sense correct--this economy is nowhere near equipped to grow at a nominal 15% or 10% rate, or honestly even 5%, sustainably. In fact, potential GDP is so bad now, because of low population and productivity growth, that we probably can't sustain nominal GDP much higher than 3% or 4% in the long run. So if we explode by 10% or 15% because of massive government stimulus, it all goes into higher prices instead of higher real economic activity.

One ""version"" of this problem is manifested in the too-strong labor market. Yep--too strong. There are too many job openings, a problem compounded by too much ""phantom demand"" caused by all the stimulus, and also by the lack of normal immigrant workers for political and pandemic reasons. We never used to see half a million jobs added per month last cycle--literally, for like fifteen years after the financial crisis, the strongest we ever saw was a couple months in roughly the 400,000 range.

And yes, we've needed to refill the gap of workers who were laid off when the pandemic hit. The leisure and hospitality sectors are still 9% smaller, implying they should be adding more workers than normal for quite some time. But the internet and crypto and home furnishings and warehouse sectors, on the other hand, grew at unsustainable rates and are shifting into layoff or stabilization mode. As even President Biden has acknowledged, we need to be seeing the pace of job growth slow to more like 150,000 a month to be sustainable.

Instead, we added 528,000 jobs last month. Which makes sense, because the weekly new jobless claims filings are still pretty low by historical standards, even if they've been creeping up from last year's unsustainably low levels. And job openings, even though they dropped a lot in the latest report, are still pointing to a massive need for workers--if nominal GDP keeps going this strong. And sure enough, MKM's Michael Darda thinks it could still be running at a double-digit pace right now, using his proxy of average weekly payrolls. Think about that!

How is inflation supposed to collapse back to 2% next year, as many economists and investors have asserted on our show, if nominal GDP is still two or three times as high as is sustainable? Of course the Fed has to keep tightening aggressively right now. And as our Bob Pisani eloquently points out, the stock market hasn't even fallen out of bed as a result. In fact, the S&P 500 is up 14% since the Fed's first 75-basis-point rate hike in mid-June.

I pointed this out in late June, as well: the Fed's super-sized hike was having exactly the effect you'd hope for across markets. Commodity prices have fallen substantially, but stock prices are higher. In terms of those warning it would cause financial market stress, credit markets look plenty open for business--Facebook parent Meta just did its first-ever bond offering last week, $10 billion in size, and it was triple-subscribed. Ten more companies are potentially offering today, according to Bloomberg, and $120 billion of new debt overall has been sold in just the past three weeks.

This is not a ""puzzling...shape-shifting economy changing its look from one week to the next,"" or one that's ""rewriting the rules."" It's just one we haven't seen in a long, long time. Fortunately, Fed policy makers seem now seem to understand its true, inflationary, overheating nature. No one can predict if their tightening will result in an actual, end-of-business-cycle recession next year, as yield curves are suggesting. But if the Fed doesn't tackle the actual inflation and overheating economy we have now, we'll all be a lot worse off for it.

See you at 1 p.m!

Feb 18 2023,"Despite Fed's best punch, U.S. economy still standing",Star Tribune,left,https://startribune.com/despite-feds-best-punch-u-s-economy-still-standing/600252656,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has come a long way since its chairman, Jerome Powell, dismissed inflation as ""transitory"" nearly three years ago. To their credit, Powell and the Fed governors eventually confronted that massive miscalculation and have spent the last 12 months aggressively raising interest rates in their battle against inflation.

It's fair to say the Fed is now winning the war. The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) released Tuesday shows 6.4% inflation compared to a year ago. The cost of goods and labor remains stubbornly high, but peak inflation (9.1% as of June 2022) is most certainly behind us.

The warning we keep hearing, however, is that the economy will be an inevitable casualty of this fight. Killing inflation, after all, requires smothering demand and that's not a recipe for strong economic growth. Based on Powell's public comments, the Fed is likely to implement a couple more rates hikes, which would bring the fed funds rate north of 5%, something that hasn't happened since 2007.

Elevated inflation, the highest interest rates in 16 years, and a still-hawkish Fed is far from an ideal market environment. And yet the economy is still standing, and in relatively good shape, despite the repeated body blows.

Fourth-quarter GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.9%. The January employment report revealed 517,000 new jobs created, nearly triple the amount expected. National unemployment has fallen to 3.4%.

At the start of 2023, most financial forecasts called for an economic recession in the second half of this year. Subduing inflation while avoiding a recession remains the optimistic alternative. Call it the Goldilocks scenario. Or the Fed threading the needle. Whatever Wall Street cliché you prefer, it seemed like a long shot.

The stock market has since staged a rally. The S&P 500 gained 6.2% in January (despite another Fed hike). Only once in the last 33 years has the S&P gotten off to a stronger start. U.S. equities are on pace for another positive month in February. While a potential recession remains on the table, a growing number of investors appear willing to peer through the gathering clouds.

For the market technicians, the S&P 500 recently broke through multiple levels of key resistance. In late January, the benchmark closed more than 1% above its 200-day moving average for the first time in nine months. Stocks have also climbed above an established downtrend dating back to the January 2022 all-time highs.

There is a growing list of reasons to feel optimistic.

The counterargument is that a resilient economy provides more ammunition for the Fed to continue raising interest rates. This may seem problematic on the surface but should not be cause for major concern.

The longest bull market in history (2009-2020) and post-pandemic recovery were both fueled by near-zero rate policies. The incredible gains of U.S. stocks during those periods conditioned investors to believe rock-bottom rates create the most favorable market environment.

But the challenges we face today are not the same as those from the previous decade. Unlike after the Great Recession, the current economy remains strong. It has already proved capable of weathering more challenging conditions and warrants a different approach from central banks.

With that in mind, it's entirely possible a fed funds rate near 5% for the foreseeable future still fosters an environment that produces favorable returns for equities. A strong economy, not low interest rates, will ultimately benefit investors most.

Congress has failed since the spring to pass much-needed additional economic stimulus. The ousted Trump administration has lost interest in pushing for a new bill. With just a few working weeks left in their lame-duck session, House Democrats want a $2 trillion to $3 trillion measure, while Senate Republicans are recommending a skinnier $500 billion to $650 billion measure. The two sides might fail to come to an agreement, and once President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated, obstructionist Republicans will have even less incentive to get a deal done.

As Washington dithers, the country will suffer. The novel coronavirus, fueled by indoor transfer over the winter holidays, will continue to maim and kill. States and cities will buckle under their budget gaps, and slash more jobs and social services. Millions of Americans will lose work. And the country’s unemployment-insurance expansion, student-loan-deferral program, and eviction moratoriums will expire, leaving the poor families bearing the brunt of this recession even more vulnerable. A double dip is possible, given that the recovery is already slowing down.

Annie Lowrey: The terrifying next phase of the coronavirus recession

None of this might come to pass, of course. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might work out a middle-of-the-road stimulus measure, helping to speed the recovery. Democrats might take both of the Georgia seats in the January runoff, thus clinching control of the Senate. Biden—a congressional veteran who is legitimately liked on both sides of the aisle and has a history of bipartisan dealmaking—might break the logjam. The economy might recover faster than expected without additional support from Washington, as businesses adjust and reopen.

But the 2020 electoral outcome—Democratic White House, Republican Senate—was the worst one in terms of getting anything done in the Capitol, and is thus a pending disaster for the country’s sick, unemployed, and poor. A Trump win likely would have eased the passage of a small but important stimulus. A Biden blowout would have allowed Democrats to pass something huge. Instead, Washington has that old 2011 feeling again.

A decade ago, the world learned what a Democratic White House and a Congress under partial Republican control could do together: nothing, or very close to it. At the time, the economy was slouching out of the worst recession since the Great Depression. The $800 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in the early days of the Obama administration, had shored up state and local finances, expanded unemployment insurance, and aided failing businesses. But it was too small by roughly half, economists estimate. With Republicans in control of the House as of 2010 and with a filibustering minority in the Senate until they won it outright in 2014, they crushed every attempt to rectify the problem.

No American Jobs Act. No cloture on even noncontroversial bills. The point was to damage the Democrats’ electoral chances, more than anything else. And the tactic worked, arguably. But it also slowed the recovery down. The United States took 10 long years to return the unemployment rate back to its prerecession low.

Similar dynamics are now at play: The economy needs more. Roughly 10 million fewer Americans are working now than were in February, wages are down sharply, and more than 1 million people are losing their jobs each month, even as the unemployment rate drops. The large, successful stimulus programs created by Congress in the spring are ending, and the cash Uncle Sam distributed is drying up. The slowing recovery might slow further, and households might become far more strained—even as the pandemic reaches deadly new heights.

Yet the real state of the economy does not seem to matter much to partisans on the Hill. On Friday, McConnell described the October jobs report—a very good one, but not one that signals an economy even close to healed—as a “stunning indication of a dramatic comeback” and justification for a smaller stimulus.

As happened a decade ago, Republicans are newly interested in tackling deficits and the debt instead of spending to boost the economy. Having spent four years not paying for anything, including giant tax cuts for rich people and corporations, they have suddenly, predictably rediscovered their concern for the supposed fiscal burdens the old are placing on the young. Senator Lindsey Graham, for instance, said that you would see him “trying to find common ground that would benefit all of us, and a good place to start, I think, would be the debt,” as well as infrastructure and immigration. Soon enough, some prominent politician will suggest a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to figure out the tough math, and start talking about trading pennies of short-term spending boosts for dollars of long-term debt reduction.

Annie Lowrey: The party of no content

The only capable body left standing? The Federal Reserve, which has already cut interest rates to zero, set up new programs to help calm the financial system, and purchased trillions of dollars of government debt. Yet, as a decade ago, it cannot do what Congress can, and put money directly in American families’ pockets. “It’s for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference this month. “I do think it’s likely that further support is likely to be needed.” A divided government is a hobbled government, and one that will hobble the recovery.

Four years of Trump have surely changed the Democratic Party, which has become less concerned about debt and become more concerned about the structure of Congress preventing legislation from passing. Statehood for Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico; the elimination of the filibuster; expanding the Supreme Court; ending gerrymandering; stopping voter suppression: These are much more pressing concerns for liberals. But have four years of Trump changed the Republican Party? If so, it has become only more antidemocratic and obstructionist. The way back for Republicans means denying President Biden any victories at all, and particularly bipartisan ones. The country’s workers, as always, will be the biggest losers."

CNN —

Every week is a tough week for this White House right now.

But as he recovers from his Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden faces a new moment of truth this week about an economy that is stuck in an identity crisis and buffeted by unpredictable outside forces – and his White House knows it, as advisers scramble to front-run what many think could be a week of more gloomy data.

“This is not an economy that’s in recession, but we’re in a period of transition in which growth is slowing,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told NBC News on Sunday, though she noted that there are “threats on the horizon.”

At any other time, a President presiding over a 3.6% unemployment rate – a shining number that normally would suggest a healthy economy – would expect his approval rating to be around 50% and be cruising to a second term. But Biden’s job performance rating has slumped into the 30s, and Democrats are bracing for big losses in midterm elections in November.

The culprit is inflation, a corrosive force that can demoralize every voter. Inflation has raced to 40-year-highs on the back of raging demand and Covid-compromised supply chains, exacerbated by a spike in oil prices. And depending whom you believe, Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan pumped a torrent of cash into the economy at the wrong time.

In short, almost everything got more expensive this year – especially the everyday expenses most Americans cannot avoid, like food, housing and gas – which is bad news for the party in power in Washington heading into an election. Notably in that CNN poll, 75% called inflation and the cost of living the most important economic problem facing their family. Last summer, that figure stood at 43%.

Expect several key reports this week on US economic health and consumer prices to offer a glimpse of how bad things could get. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve is also expected to raise interest rates again in an attempt to tame inflation, though some experts think the Fed’s new aggressive strategy came too late and risks tipping the economy into a recession.

As CNN Business’ Nicole Goodkind wrote in a piece titled, “What the Fed and Madonna have in common,” over the weekend, “The central bank’s dependability hinges on Americans believing that it’s … dependable.”

“If Fed Chair Jerome Powell says the Fed will reduce historically high inflation rates, Americans believe him and change their behavior to reflect that. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, the Fed’s version of The Secret,” Goodkind writes.

“But perception doesn’t always line up with reality, and the economists at the Federal Reserve are as susceptible to capricious economic shifts as you and I. There is no official rulebook to follow; they make their monetary policy through trial-and-error, and there have been errors,” she continues.

“The Fed, much like Madonna, is constantly evolving. This institution that aims to project an aura of stability is not beyond surprising us.”

Meanwhile, amid all the focus on inflation’s erosion of the strength of US paychecks, Goodkind notes that this week marks a sobering milestone for struggling American families: It’s been 13 years since the last time the US federal minimum wage was raised, to $7.25 an hour, making it the longest period without a raise since the federal minimum wage was enacted in 1938. (About 30 states and Washington, DC, have minimum wages above the federal standard.)

That can’t be helping Biden in the face of dismal poll numbers on the economy. Only 18% of Americans in that CNN survey described the nation’s economy as in good shape, while 82% said economic conditions are poor.

The latest Consumer Confidence Index from the Conference Board is due to be released Tuesday, after last month’s report showed souring confidence in the face of high gas and food prices and rising recession risks. Another closely watched snapshot of data – the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, which charts changes in the prices of goods and services bought by US consumers – is out on Friday.

Responding to the news earlier this month that inflation had surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, with US consumer prices jumping by 9.1% year-over-year, the White House seized on a more recent dip in gas prices, while complaining that the tumbling price was not being covered by the media with the same intensity that accompanied the hike in prices.

But public perceptions of the economy aren’t likely to change that fast.

While a recession is commonly defined by two consecutive negative quarters of gross domestic product growth, there’s no steadfast rule governing what defines a recession in the United States.

The National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee abides by a relatively vague definition that allows for wiggle room: A recession, it says, “involves a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”

The committee also takes its time in defining when a recession begins and ends, making sure to look at data on a broad timeline. The designations often come retroactively – which means the US could currently be in the middle of a recession without anyone officially recognizing it until after the fact.

Brian Deese, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said on CNN’s “New Day” on Monday that the second quarter data would be “inherently backward-looking” since it reflects the situation from April through June.

“I think the bottom line is if you look at the labor market, if you look at what consumers are spending, what businesses and households are investing, you continue to see this resilience. But that’s no reason for complacency,” Deese said.

The attempt to get ahead of potentially bad economic data mirrors the White House’s approach on inflation when it recently argued that inflation numbers for June that showed the 9.1% year-on-year rise were “out of date” since they didn’t reflect a dip in gasoline prices.

But if the economic data this week suggests that the US economy is heading anywhere near a recession, it will mean another round of bad headlines for Biden and an opening for Republicans just over three months before the midterm elections.

And even if this week’s data suggest that the economy isn’t heading for a recession, it will still be a hard sell for the White House. Any president arguing that the economy isn’t really as bad as it feels to voters is in trouble."

Feb 03 2023,Unemployment at lowest level since 1969 as economy smashes expectations,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-again-beats-expectations-with-517-000-jobs-in-december-unemployment-falls-to-3-4,"The economy gained 517,000 jobs in January, smashing expectations, in another sign that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have yet to harm the labor market substantially.

The figures reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning provide reassurance about the strength of the economy. The unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest rate since 1969.

The results of the employment report come as a big surprise for economists. The consensus estimate was that the economy would add just 185,000 jobs and unemployment would actually rise by a tenth of a percentage point rather than falling to 3.4%.

“A fundamental surprise,” Brian Marks, executive director of the University of New Haven’s Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program, told the Washington Examiner after the report was released. “Going forward, this sort of signals to the Fed to continue down its path of increasing rates.”

Friday’s report is being closely scrutinized as it comes just days after the Federal Reserve voted to raise interest rates once again, albeit by a smaller amount. A stronger jobs report shows that rate hikes aren’t yet having the punch officials hoped and could cause the Fed to lean toward a more aggressive monetary stance in the new year.

The reading follows several months of strong job gains, which have been key positive economic data that President Joe Biden has touted even as historic inflation cuts deeply into the paychecks of people across the country. This newest report cuts into that narrative and raises fears about recession.

STATE OF THE ECONOMY — TAKING HITS AND RUNNING UP DEFICITS

One part of the economy that is in a downturn is the housing market, as the Fed’s efforts have translated to much higher mortgage interest rates.

Existing home sales were down a hefty 34% from the year before in December, according to the National Association of Realtors. It was also the worst December since the financial crisis.

The number of construction jobs grew by 25,000 in January, Friday’s jobs report revealed. The sector ultimately added more jobs per month in 2022 than it did in 2021. Residential construction employment, specifically, grew just slightly from the month before.

One reason construction employment hasn’t fallen by as much as one might think is that the housing market went from overheated to cold so fast that there is a glut of homes still under construction. As those construction projects finally start to come to an end (and as far fewer new projects are begun), those jobs will start to dwindle.

Friday’s report comes after a spate of good news about the jobs market. New claims for unemployment benefits, a proxy for layoffs, are running near the lowest levels in decades. Job openings unexpectedly jumped to 11 million in December, the bureau reported earlier this week. Despite reports of mass layoffs in the tech sector and elsewhere, the labor market as a whole has appeared strong in recent months.

The impressively strong labor market, coupled with recent reports suggesting that inflation is beginning to decline, has raised hope that the Fed might be able to drive down inflation without causing a recession, a scenario referred to as a “soft landing.”

Two consecutive quarters of GDP decline are typically indicative of a recession. After tumbling in the first quarter of last year, GDP fell at a 0.6% annualized rate in the second quarter, a final estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed. Still, GDP grew at a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter and 2.9% in the fourth quarter, reversing the negative trend and further complicating the country’s economic situation.

Still, most economists expect a recession to be declared sometime in the coming 12 months, with more than two-thirds of the economists at major financial institutions surveyed by the Wall Street Journal predicting a coming recession due to the Fed’s aggressive rate hiking."

Millions of people have lost their jobs, and millions more will. Estimates for how much unemployment is expected to spike and GDP will fall are staggering. Production and spending across much of the country have been brought to an abrupt halt.

It’s natural to want to see a light at the end of the tunnel, obviously in terms of the health crisis caused by coronavirus but also for the economy. And there will be one — eventually.

“The very best-case scenario is we rapidly bounce back and we get close to something where we were before. Personally, I think that’s highly unlikely. The shock from the virus is going to trigger a broader economy-wide recession,” said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan. “That’s a really harsh reality.”

Related Coronavirus could lead to the highest unemployment levels since the Great Depression

The question of when and how the economy gets better largely hinges on our ability to get the virus itself under control. Despite calls from some Republican lawmakers to get back to business before that happens and even some speculation about reopening the economy early from the president, it’s not a realistic scenario — people likely aren’t going to be falling over themselves to go out to restaurants and pack into movie theaters as a deadly virus spreads, or as they or their loved ones get sick.

At some point — and we don’t know exactly when — the economy will bounce back, at least partially. When it does, that new normal will be different. Many Americans may be worse off than they were before, some people may still be afraid to resume their lives as they once lived them, and many businesses may have permanently closed.

“There will likely be some permanent damage inflicted on the economy,” says Greg Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics. “What this shock is doing is exacerbating preexisting inequality issues across the country. The individuals who have been hit the hardest are the individuals who were in the most precarious position to start with.”

Economists say it could be anywhere from 2021 to 2031 before the economy returns to something like the pre-coronavirus “normal.” But it may never be entirely the same.

“We’ve never seen anything like this before, so we’re speculating along with everyone else,” Edgerton said.

What the economic recovery will look like: Contraction, a partial bounceback, and the long slog

The first prerequisite for economic recovery will be a public health solution: widespread testing, tracing of possible infections, antibody testing for immunity, adequate supplies for the health care system, and so on. The coronavirus outbreak will need to be firmly under control before the economy can resume anything approaching normalcy, and we just don’t know yet when the public health breakthrough will happen. Consumers need confidence that participating in the economy won’t get them or their loved ones sick before they will revert to their typical economic activity.

“The longer these issues linger in the form of people not having confidence in returning to their daily activities,” Daco said, “the more severe these dislocations will be.”

But once that has been achieved, the problems and solutions we are dealing with will become more recognizably economic. Jason Furman, a former top economist for President Barack Obama who is now at Harvard, told Vox the economic fallout and recovery will likely have three stages:

Contraction: That’s what Americans are experiencing right now, with millions of people losing their jobs while business investment and consumer spending fall off precipitously. A partial bounceback: Once society starts to reopen, there will be a lot of hiring and spending and investment to ignite the recovery, but that is unlikely to bring the economy all the way back to where it was in January 2020. The long slog: After the initial but incomplete improvement, it may take a long time for unemployment and wages to return to levels similar to the pre-coronavirus economy.

The timeline for the second and third steps is difficult to know. The recovery is likely to look robust at first; Furman suggested we could see some of the most impressive job gains (a million or more in a month) and GDP growth numbers ever. Parts of the economy should be able to snap back to something approximating their pre-crisis state.

And such a quick recovery could be self-reinforcing, at least up to a point.

“If the economy starts surging back, then some businesses will suddenly face insufficient capacity. Those businesses will have to double down on hiring, ordering supplies and investment in new equipment, capital, etc.,” Karl Smith, vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation, says. “That then provides an extra boost of demand for the rest of the economy that produces a secondary wave of investment.”

While it’s not possible to rule out a rapid and complete return to normalcy — a V-shaped recovery, in the economists’ lingo — most experts we spoke to consider it unlikely. Too much structural damage has been done, jobs and businesses lost that will never come back. Supply chains have been broken and need to be rebuilt.

Americans are more likely to find themselves in something like the 2011 or 2012 environment after the Great Recession: The economy is no longer the biggest story in the world, but the unemployment rate will be high and wages will still be depressed. It’s helpful to remember how the economic recovery began last time around in June 2009, when the national unemployment rate was at 9.5 percent. A year later in 2010, it was stuck at 9.4 percent. In 2011, it was 8.2 percent. Unemployment didn’t fall below 5 percent until early 2016. And in this crisis, the unemployment rate is expected to have an even higher peak.

“The shock from the virus ... is going to be enough to tip off at least a normal recession in the rest of the economy beyond these direct effects of the sectors that we have had to shut down. ... We should expect the next nine months or a year to look like a recession, to continue to see high levels of unemployment and depressed levels of output,” Edgerton said. He predicted that “it will be at least a few years before we feel as good as we did in January.”

How long this lasts, and what the recovery looks like, depends on actions while the health crisis is still underway. The government has passed a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to try to prop up the economy in the meantime, and more federal spending will be needed. But transitioning from stimulus provisions to a normal economy can be tricky.

Smith pointed out the enhanced unemployment aid will be a boon to consumer demand in the short term while depressing labor supply, but as soon as it’s cut off, demand could drop because people have less money to spend and not everyone will get a new job immediately. (One way to avoid that: a phase-out of some kind.)

“It really depends, to my mind, on just how much damage is done during the time that the economy is shut down in the way it is now,” said former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen in a recent interview with CNBC. The more workers are laid off, the more households that run down their savings, the more people who fall behind on their bills, the longer the slog of recovery.

The recovery can take many shapes if you think of it as a line graph: a V, a U or, worst of all, an L (sharp sudden drop and long gradual climb). Yellen said, “The more damage of that sort is done, the more likely we are to see a U, and there are worse letters, too, like L, and I hope we don’t see something like that.”

Inequality could get worse because low-wage workers getting hit the hardest

Just as we saw after prior economic crises, not everybody will experience the same recovery. For the wealthy and higher-income people, those who didn’t lose their jobs and whose financial well-being was more marginally affected, they may bounce back to normal quickly once they go back to work full time and the stock market starts to improve.

“There will be some individuals who have V-shaped recovery,” Claudia Sahm, who worked a the Federal Reserve through the 2008 recession and is now director of macroeconomic policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, says. “The people who came into this with a good financial position … they’re gonna be fine.”

But the job market for low-wage workers is probably going to look a lot worse, even as the broader economy starts to pull out of the coronavirus recession.

At the beginning of this year, the unemployment rate was down around 3 percent and wages were ticking up. That’s basic supply and demand: There weren’t a lot of workers out there looking for a job, so firms had to raise wages to be competitive. But that new reality, which took years to reach after the Great Recession, has been dismantled.

We already know that low-wage service sector jobs were the most vulnerable to being cut because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

And when the public health crisis is over and life starts to return to normal, unemployment could be 15 or even 20 percent. There are going to be a lot of workers looking to fill those open slots, especially as the emergency unemployment benefits in the stimulus bill start to expire.

“Wages are going to come out of the recovery worse than they were,” Sahm says. “Everything is going to be worse for workers who went into the recession in the most fragile position, and there are a lot of them.”

The horizon for workers may shake out differently depending on geography. University of California Berkeley economist Danny Yagan found that after the Great Recession, workers who lived in places that were hard hit by the recession were less likely to be employed at all in 2015, even if the local unemployment rate had recovered. It appears that years later, some people in the most affected areas had just given up looking for work altogether.

The economic crisis may exacerbate racial income inequality as well. In 2015, a report from the ACLU estimated that by 2031, wealth for white households would be 31 percent less than it would have been had the Great Recession never happened. For black households, it would be down nearly 40 percent. And the coronavirus crisis is already hitting black communities especially hard. Early numbers suggest black people are at higher risk for contracting and dying of coronavirus, and a smaller proportion of black and Hispanic workers are able to work from home compared to Asian Americans and whites.

“We know that blacks, Latinx, and native people, in terms of race and ethnicity, they have lower levels of reserves, and we also know that their employment is more precarious than that of white people,” Darrick Hamilton, the executive director of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, recently told Vox.

Some parts of the economy will never be the same

Maybe the hardest truth to accept, however, is that some things may never go back to the way they were.

The travel and hospitality industries could be in for a long depression of their own, depending on how quick people are to trust the safety of international travel or venturing far from their homes. This is where the public health response comes back into play: The sooner people feel confident about testing and infection tracing, confident enough to book a flight and a hotel room in some far-flung destination, the sooner those industries will be back to normal.

“Where I do see the potential for change, and I don’t know if it’s permanent or long-lasting, is travel,” Daco says. “There may be an environment of caution going forward in terms of travel. You’ll likely see a normalization in local services first, before you see a normalization in travel-related activity. People are still going to be cautious when it comes to boarding a plane and going on a vacation. The same may be true for business travel.”

The same goes for bars and restaurants, at least in the short term — it might be some time before people are comfortable crowding into such establishments, and many places may not survive the crisis. As much as you may be trying to order delivery to keep your local favorites afloat, you cannot order enough pad Thai to pay their rent. But, presumably, at some point, people will start going out to eat again like they once did.

It may take some time for live events to enjoy the audiences they once did, too, though Furman said he expects that at some point, the live entertainment industry will look pretty much the same as it did before the crisis.

And broadly speaking, we may see greater market concentration in sectors where many small businesses were lost. Congress has tried to prop up small businesses through loans approved in the stimulus package, but there are already reports of problems with the actual administration of those benefits. The more small businesses that close because of the initial economic shock or a problem accessing federal benefits, or both, the more the markets they leave behind will be concentrated among a handful of dominant players.

It’s certainly worth asking if Americans want the economy to go back to exactly the same way it was. The coronavirus crisis has exposed and exacerbated deep flaws in the US system, including the economy. Corporations that just got a massive tax cut may now not have many resources to weather the downturn. Why were large businesses able to spend much of that tax windfall on stock buybacks and executive compensation? Why haven’t workers been paid enough to build up savings to get by when they lose their jobs through no fault of their own? Where is the social safety net?

“In the United States, economic inequality has been on the steep incline for a long time, and there were many people already on the verge before this happened, systems already failing,” said Jamila Michener, an assistant professor of government at Cornell University. “It just highlights all the cracks and the flaws and faults that already existed.”"
May 03 2023,Federal Reserve confronts 'contradictory' economy as it considers next interest rate hike,NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/business/economy/federal-reserve-next-interest-rate-hike-may-2023-how-much-rcna82277,"The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday it was raising its key federal funds rate to more than 5% — a 16-year high — as it continues its firefight against persistent inflation.

In a statement announcing the hike — the 10th-consecutive one since March 2022 — it omitted previous language that signaled more hikes are likely.

While inflation remained elevated, higher borrowing costs for households and businesses ""are likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation,"" the central bank said, adding that the extent of these effects ""remains uncertain.""

It added that job gains had been ""robust"" in recent months and noted that the unemployment rate remained low.

In an emailed statement following the announcement, Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said this moment could prove a ""last call"" for savers and anyone else looking to take advantage of attractive deposit-rate offerings from banks.

""CD yields on maturities of one year and longer have peaked and now is the time to lock in,"" he said. ""A slowing economy coupled with the Fed moving to the sidelines mean CD yields will start pulling back soon.”

The latest decision comes at a fraught moment as high prices, high interest rates and slowing growth would all seem to spell an economic downturn.

Indeed, many consumers would agree that between inflation and tighter credit conditions — and with no more pandemic financial assistance in sight — this is the worst they’ve felt about their finances since the pandemic broke out and upended everything.

Yet, as the Federal Reserve readied to make its latest interest rate announcement, financial commentators continued to disagree about how it should be responding to economic conditions.

According to data from the CME Group, Wall Street traders were betting that the Fed would announce another 0.25% rate hike — but that it will be forced to cut rates at least twice before the end of the year as economic growth slows to a crawl.

Others disagreed about how exactly this all plays out. In an emailed statement, Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said that with inflation still elevated and sticky and with the broad economic picture still looking ""fairly robust,"" the Fed would be more likely than not to keep additional rate hikes on the table.

""Provided the economic data slows only gently and inflation remains elevated, and the banking sector volatility is fairly contained, we think a June hike is still possible,"" she wrote. ""Indeed, we believe there is a higher risk of a rate hike in June than what the market is currently pricing in.""

That is largely the view of economists at the Citigroup, as well. In a note to clients published Sunday, the group said it expected the Fed to strike a “hawkish” tone in its latest language announcing the expected rate hike — meaning it will indicate inflation has not yet been tamed and, therefore, interest rates must remain elevated for longer.

The Citi analysts cite recent price-level data that has continued to come in higher than expected. The graphic below from the Atlanta Federal Reserve illustrates this:

""Rather than signaling a pause, the committee will want to preserve the option for further rate hikes,"" the Citi economists write. ""In our base case the Fed will raise rates by 25bp [0.25%] this week and again in June and July.""

Those forecasts were countered elsewhere. Heading into Wednesday, the chorus of voices calling for the Fed to pause kept growing. On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to halt rate hikes entirely, warning that too many increases would cost a growing cohort of people their jobs.

""We believe that continuing to raise interest rates would be an abandonment of the Fed’s dual mandate to achieve both maximum employment and price stability and show little regard for the small businesses and working families that will get caught in the wreckage,” they wrote.

Analysts at Nomura global financial services group offered something of a middle ground: While they forecast the Fed would raise the rate by the expected 0.25%, they said it will prove a “dovish hike” as the central bankers replace previous language that signaled additional hikes will be necessary, planning to take a more wait-and-see approach.

Perhaps the best summation of the economic crosswinds facing the Fed was found in an anonymous response to the monthly report from the Institute for Supply Management, which showed a modest increase in sentiment among producers for April.

""We seem to be in a season of contradictions,"" said the respondent, identified only as an executive at a metals manufacturing firm. ""Business is slowing, but in some ways, it isn’t. Prices for some commodities are stabilizing, but not for others. Some product shortages are over, others aren’t. Trucking is more plentiful, except when it isn’t. There’s uncertainty one day, but not the next. The next couple of months should provide answers — or not. It’s hard to make projections at the moment.”

For Shah, the prevailing crosscurrents signal the worst outcome of all.

""The most dangerous risk for financial markets currently is stagflation — the risk of the Fed failing to deliver sufficient tightening, permitting a resurgence in inflation later on in the year,"" she wrote."

Dec 08 2013,"Is it always the economy, stupid?",CNN (Online News),left,http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/06/politics/obama-economy/index.html?hpt=po_c1,"Story highlights The Obama legacy likely will include many elements One will be the economy It might even be THE one in the long-term of history

Washington CNN —

There will be plenty of legacy items by which to judge President Barack Obama.

Obamacare, for instance: Whether the new law that seeks health insurance for every American is a prudent piece of policy or an albatross of government overreach is a matter of opinion. How about drawing down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? What about his efforts to police suspected terrorists abroad through the use of deadly drone strikes?

None of these, in the long run, might be as important as his efforts to help the economy, which, ironically, has felt stronger just as Americans’ faith in Obama to steer it has dwindled.

According to a Pew Research Center poll from November, just 31% of Americans approve of the way he is handling the economy.

By one measure, the Obama economy is almost back to par. If he’s lucky, the economy might be able to save his second term.

“It’s impossible to tell the future,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton who has written about presidents and their legacies for CNN. “If the economy moves in a positive direction and in the next two years we are really out of the sluggish economy that he started his presidency with, people will value that.”

What sort of value remains to be seen.

The short-memory syndrome

Certainly, handing off a good economy would help his long-term legacy. In the short term, there seems to be little appetite among Republicans on Capitol Hill for some of his legislative priorities like raising the minimum wage or passing an immigration reform bill.

An emboldened president would enter those negotiations with a stronger hand. He’d also have more power to sway budget negotiations that could affect future spending on social programs such as Medicare and Social Security.

Stephen Weatherford, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said Americans have short memories.

“To a kind of ironic extent, if presidents come in facing big problems and they’re able to do something to solve those problems, people don’t evaluate them based on those problems,” he said.

“It becomes a kind of, ‘What have you done for me lately?’ problem,” said Weatherford, who thinks Obama’s domestic legacy will be focused squarely on the health care law.

“I think if the health care law is in place and works, he’ll be remembered really favorably,” said Weatherford, comparing the law to the Great Society social programs enacted by President Lyndon Johnson.

The U.S. unemployment rate fell to 7% in November. It’s an imperfect measure for the health of the economy. People long unemployed and who aren’t looking for work aren’t counted, for example. But that’s the lowest unemployment rate since Obama was first elected president, when the rate sat at 6.8%.

In hindsight, that 6.8% figure from 2008 seems low, either because Americans at the time were used to much lower jobless rates or because in the time since then we’ve become used to much higher rates. In 2008, the economic ground was rumbling with talk of the potential for an economic apocalypse.

The unemployment rate grew a full percentage point in the 2 1/2 months between his election that year and his inauguration in January 2009, and it peaked a little less than a year into his presidency at 10% in October 2009.

Now we call it the Great Recession, something much worse than your father’s recession but probably not quite as bad as your grandfather’s Great Depression.

The U.S. government took an activist approach to saving the economy. It began pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into bailouts of the banking and auto industries in the final days of the Bush administration. The Federal Reserve was just beginning to pump trillions of dollars into the economy through a menu of bond-buying programs and artificially low interest rates.

Taking an approach, running with it

Obama took this activist approach and ran with it. He spent a good portion of his new political capital passing a nearly $800 billion stimulus program opposed by all but three Republicans in the Senate.

The rollout of the stimulus, by the way, was beset by a flawed website and created a huge political headache as those hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars flooded into the economy – the effect was not immediately felt by everyone and it was hard to quantify as it was spread across years.

Even if the recovery is felt most prominently in the coming years, it could affect perception of those early programs, Zelizer said.

“If the last two years of the Obama presidency are filled with a possibility economy, it’s going to change the way we view the stimulus and his other economic programs,” he said.

Temporary increases to food stamps authorized by the stimulus package only ran out at the beginning of November. Temporary increases in unemployment insurance are set to run out at the end of this year. The ultimate effect of billions spent on infrastructure had a short-term effect on jobs, but will also have long-term benefits.

Continued growth will come with growing pains. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke or his soon-to-be successor Janet Yellen are expected to taper off the Fed programs that have helped buoy the back end of the economy and kept interest rates down.

The Congressional Budget Office guessed that the stimulus kept the unemployment rate 2% lower than it otherwise would have been in 2010. That means the country could have faced 12% unemployment instead of 10% at the height of the Great Recession, but we’ll never know for sure.

What we do know is that the national debt skyrocketed as the federal government spent furiously to save the economy. The stimulus cost $830 billion, according to the CBO. Deficits have started to shrink as the economy has improved and Republicans in Congress have insisted on spending cuts. But the debt now stands at nearly $17 trillion.

America’s Debt: CNN Money special section

A Wall Street rally; a widening divide

But while the stock market has rallied during the Obama presidency – the Dow Jones Industrial Average has nearly doubled during his time in office – the divide between wealthy and struggling Americans has grown exponentially.

Potentially rising interest rates and less help for the unemployed and the hungry as those stimulus programs run out could exacerbate the problem, which Obama has made clear will be a focus of his remaining time in office.

“I believe this is the defining challenge of our time: Making sure our economy works for every working American. It’s why I ran for President. It was at the center of last year’s campaign,” Obama told a liberal group during a speech in an economically depressed area of Washington, D.C., on Wednesday. “It drives everything I do in this office. And I know I’ve raised this issue before, and some will ask why I raise the issue again right now.”

He later added that he think the government should be spending money to invest in creating opportunities for Americans.

“A relentlessly growing deficit of opportunity is a bigger threat to our future than our rapidly shrinking fiscal deficit,” he said.

After his re-election, Obama extended Bush-era tax cuts for all but the wealthiest Americans, making good on his campaign effort to make them pay a little more in the coming years.

The economy for years has been the issue that Americans want politicians to fix. More than health care or the Iraq war, the economy dominated the 2008 election — 55% of voters said it was the most important problem facing the country.

Four years later, when Obama was re-elected, the economy and unemployment split the top spot.

Perhaps one sign of an improved economy is that a different poll, conducted by Gallup in October, found that the economy is no longer the top concern of Americans. Now it is “government dysfunction.”

Two academics wrote recently that Democratic presidents seem to preside over generally better economies than Republicans. But there’s no evidence that their policies are the reason.

That means it’s perhaps not fair to give presidents credit when the economy improves or blame them when it goes bad.

“It’s never fair,” Zelizer said. “Presidents don’t have total control of the economy. They can’t even control Congress. But fair or not, that’s what happens.”"
Jun 02 2023,"The U.S. economy added 339,000 jobs in May, once again beating expectations",NBC News (Online),left,https://nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-economy-added-33900-jobs-may-beating-expectations-rcna87404,"The U.S. economy continued to crank out jobs in May, with nonfarm payrolls surging more than expected despite multiple headwinds, the Labor Department reported Friday.

Payrolls in the public and private sector increased by 339,000 for the month, better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate and marking the 29th straight month of positive job growth.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.7% in May against the estimate for 3.5%, even though the labor force participation rate was unchanged. The jobless rate was the highest since October 2022, though still near the lowest since 1969.

Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, rose 0.3% for the month, which was in line with expectations. On an annual basis, wages increased 4.3%, which was 0.1 percentage point below the estimate. The average workweek fell by 0.1 hour to 34.3 hours.

Markets reacted positively to the report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average up about 200 points. Treasury yields rose as well.

May’s hiring jump was almost exactly in line with the 12-month average of 341,000 in a job market that has held up remarkably well in an economy that has been slowing.

Professional and business services led job creation for the month with a net 64,000 new hires. The government helped boost the numbers with an addition of 56,000 jobs, while health care contributed 52,000.

Other notable gainers included leisure and hospitality (48,000), construction (25,000) and transportation and warehousing (24,000).

May’s job numbers come amid a challenging time for the economy, with many experts still expecting a recession later this year or early in 2024.

Recent data has shown that consumers continue to spend, though they are dipping into savings and increasingly using credit cards to pay for their purchases. A resilient labor market also has helped underpin spending, with job openings rising back above 10 million in April as employers still find it difficult to fill open positions.

One major potential headache appears to have been eliminated, as warring factions in Washington this week have reached a debt ceiling deal. An agreement is on its way to President Joe Biden’s desk for a signature following passage in the House and Senate this week.

There remain other issues ahead, though.

The Federal Reserve has raised benchmark interest rates 10 times since March 2022 in an effort to fight inflation that hasn’t gone away. In recent days, some policymakers have indicated a willingness to take a break in June from the succession of hikes as they look to see what impact the policy tightening is having on the economy.

Other data points have shown that the manufacturing sector of the economy is in contraction, though the much larger services sector has held in expansion. The ISM manufacturing index released Thursday also showed that prices are pulling back, a positive sign for the Fed."

He will keep holding the three main crowns of power in China — party, military and state — with no rivals or potential successors vying for attention.

The New York Times ran a story this week suggesting that the economic recovery is slowing and, in certain industries in certain parts of the country, even reversing. This makes sense given the resurgence of coronavirus cases in places like Texas and Florida and the more-cautious reopening measures being taken in other, less affected areas worried that a spike might be just around the corner. On Wednesday, New York City announced it would indefinitely postpone the resumption of indoor dining service, as New Jersey did a few days prior. California has also ordered restaurants and bars to close again in much of the state. It’s likely that in the coming weeks, we’ll see that spending in food and beverage service establishments has gone back into decline nationally.

There are two separate trends we may be seeing right now that are causing the economic recovery to slow, and they may be difficult to differentiate when looking at the data. One is the growing realization that it will be more difficult for certain sectors of the economy to return before the virus is fully tamed than previously thought. Some businesses were in a position to reopen quickly when allowed to do so; many of them have already reopened and part, or all of, their staff has returned to work. But other businesses will be disrupted persistently until there is an effective medical treatment for COVID-19, and some businesses will never reopen at all; it will necessarily take more time for workers and owners in those businesses to find new things to do. This has always been a reason not to get too complacent about the pace of the recovery and to ensure that the economy has adequate government policy support after the expiration of key CARES Act programs this summer. One thing we may have been learning in the past couple of weeks is that more of the hospitality industry will be in the persistently affected category than we had hoped, waiting for effective medical interventions before the industry can return anywhere close to normal, and with some establishments closing permanently in the meantime.

The other factor slowing the recovery is, of course, a worsening of epidemiological conditions in large swaths of the country. You can see the regional effects in data from OpenTable, which has been providing daily information on the number of diners seated in its member establishments since the start of the epidemic. Nationally, restaurants on the OpenTable network were about twice as busy at the end of June as they were at the beginning, with customer volumes down about 60 percent from the prior year instead of 80 percent. But there is significant regional variation: Restaurant traffic started falling in mid-June in Phoenix and in late June in major Texas metropolitan areas, even as it continued to rise (from a very low base) in northeastern markets. Importantly, customer volumes in Texas started falling before the state announced it would close bars and reduce restaurant capacity. In New York City, where only outdoor dining is permitted, OpenTable is recording just 6 percent of usual volumes — but that’s an increase from 0 percent at the start of the month, when restaurants were closed altogether.

Debates about when to impose and lift activity restrictions aimed at stopping the coronavirus are often framed as pitting economic growth against disease prevention, but this frame is wrong for two reasons. First, as the economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Svyerson argue in a new working paper comparing economic activity in adjacent counties with differing coronavirus-related regulations, coronavirus-related drops in economic activity appear to be overwhelmingly driven by choices made by individual consumers and firms, not by government regulation. Regulations are important for determining the precise nature of economic activity — when you close indoor dining, people spend less in restaurants and more in grocery stores — but have relatively modest effects on the aggregate amount of economic activity. That is, if people are scared of getting sick, they will go out and work less and spend less, even if the government does not order certain kinds of businesses to close.

Second, when you permit activities that are especially risky from a virus- transmission perspective, all other activities become riskier than they would otherwise be as a result. If you open bars and people take that opportunity to hold coronavirus super-spreading events with groups of friends, there is a larger population of infected people out there who can give COVID-19 to people they meet at the office, or in a supermarket, or in a small gathering at a neighbor’s home. So while reopening bars would seem to be a way to let some people go back to work, generate some more sales tax revenue, and give a frustrated public another opportunity to blow off steam, it is likely that jurisdictions that reopened their bars hurt their economies by increasing the virus spread and making members of the public reasonably more afraid to engage in a wide variety of activities seemingly unrelated to bars.

The fact that better epidemiological conditions allow you to engage in more economic activity makes it especially crazy that so many conservatives who favor a faster economic reopening have been critical of mask mandates and dismissive of private choices to wear them — even sometimes saying, as Republican consultant Alex Castellanos did this week, that masks are a social and political affectation. There are some questions about whether masks are truly necessary in some settings. But widespread mask-wearing in public indoor spaces should make congregating indoors for economic purposes less hazardous and therefore make a wider variety of economic activities sustainable.

So while aspects of the recovery are at significant risk today, there is a road map toward a faster and more stable recovery: Wear masks, especially indoors, and don’t let people conduct especially hazardous indoor activities. It should have been possible to infer these lessons from events in Europe and New York in March and April, but it is good news that officials in the South and Southwest appear to be learning them now, however belatedly. Closing the bars should put us on a better track toward keeping other parts of the economy open, especially if people keep their faces covered."

Jun 09 2020,The US economy is officially in recession,Yahoo News,left,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-officially-in-recession-nber-165226139.html,"The National Bureau of Economic Research said Monday that the COVID-19 crisis has officially launched the U.S. economy into a recession, thus ending the longest economic expansion on record.

Read more: What is a recession? Here are the basics

The NBER’s business cycle dating committee calls recessions based on broad checks on employment and production activity.

The committee said that it had determined that economic activity had peaked in February, citing sharp drops in employment and personal consumption following that month. The recession declaration ended the 128-month economic expansion that began in June 2009, which eclipsed the 1990s recovery as the longest on record.

When the NBER declares a “peak,” it essentially marks the beginning of a period of “significant decline.”

Since the first cases of Coronavirus took form in the United States, over 42 million Americans have lost their jobs and turned to unemployment benefits. Stay-at-home measures and businesses closures have halted economic activity on an unprecedented scale.

The NBER said official data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that the labor market peaked in February. On production, GDP figures have yet to be published for the quarter covering the brunt of the pandemic. But the NBER said monthly readings on real personal consumption measures appeared to confirm that the U.S. consumer - a key driver of the economy - also peaked in February.

A recession is generally perceived to be two consecutive quarters of negative growth in U.S. production, measured as real GDP.

But the NBER has other criteria that can constitute a recession, which is particularly applicable to the COVID-19 crisis given the speed of the economic downturn. The committee looks for a “significant decline in economic activity” across several economic indicators, which covers not just GDP but factors like real income and employment, as well as retail and manufacturing sales.

The NBER declares a “trough” when economic activity appears to hit a bottom, which is also reported on a lag.

May 20 2020,The dangers of not reopening the U.S. economy,Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/may/20/the-dangers-of-not-reopening-the-us-economy/,"OPINION:

We must reopen our economy — unlike the mainstream media and political elites who would like you to believe the coronavirus lockdown is a health-versus-the economy issue, the lockdown is actually a health-versus-health issue too.

There are serious health consequences of keeping the American economy shut down, whether its suicide rates spiking, cardiac procedures not being received, cancer screenings declining, or children going without their routine vaccinations. Not to mention the widening economic disparity between the rich and the poor, which has its own health implications as well.

Yes, there are risks associated with reopening the economy, but we now have the hospital beds and testing available to mitigate these risks. The whole idea behind “flattening the curve,” of which most Americans happily obliged, was to ensure localities had these important resources. Now that they do, the goal-posts have somehow been moved to “stay-at-home until we find a cure,” which would not only devastate our economy, but our nation’s health as well.

Just take into consideration the following statistics since the nation went into lockdown:

• In April, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration hotline saw a 1,000 percent increase in text messages related to the coronavirus lockdown.

• Screenings for cervical, colon and breast cancer have decreased between 86 percent and 94 percent during the lockdown period.

• Over 80,000 diagnoses of five common cancers in the United States are projected to be missed or delayed during the period of early March to June.

• Nearly 75,000 Americans could die from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide as a result of COVID-19.

• Over 5,000 people called the National Domestic Violence hotline since mid-March and cited coronavirus as a trigger.

• Childhood vaccination efforts nearly ground to a halt between March 13 — when the national emergency was declared — and April 19.

Moreover, the L.A. Times reported the economic devastation the pandemic has had on the ultra-poor could ultimately kill more people than the virus itself.

“The U.N. predicts the coronavirus could push an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020. World Vision, an international Christian aid organization, warns that 30 million children are at risk of dying,” the newspaper reported.

In the United States alone, one in five people who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, and this disproportionally affected low-income workers. Nearly 40 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, Federal Reserve data showed.

Everything from life expectancy to infant mortality and obesity — can be linked to the level of economic inequality within a given population and greater economic inequality appears to lead to worse health outcomes, according to the Institute of Policy Studies.

It’s time to ease up restrictions and manage this virus prudently.

State and local officials need to make responsible decisions on how and when to reopen based on scientific data, yet many of them are not.

In almost half of the reported counties within the U.S., there has not been a single coronavirus death, and 62 percent of all coronavirus cases come in just 2 percent of the reported counties, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Meaning, there are wide swathes of this country that are safe to reopen. There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to reopening but reopen we must.

Scientists, doctors and political figures are calling the shots for the working class, yet they have less at stake — most are still getting paid and have the privilege of working from home. Yet, many average Americans simply do not and must continue to put food on their table and support their families amid the backdrop of this pandemic.

Americans understand there’s risk involved in reopening — all they’re asking for is the choice to take that risk safely and responsibly. Instead of judgment from the ruling class, there should be sympathy and respect for these workers, who have everything at stake, from their personal health to their economic livelihoods.

Aug 15 2023,Biden+heads+to+battleground+Wisconsin+to+talk+about+the+economy+a+week+before+GOP+debate,Wisconsin Law Journal,center,https://wislawjournal.com/2023/08/15/biden-heads-to-battleground-wisconsin-to-talk-about-the-economy-a-week-before-gop-debate,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is stopping in the battleground state of Wisconsin to discuss how economic policies he calls “Bidenomics” are boosting the economy. The Tuesday trip is timed one day before the first anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, a major economic bill Biden signed into law. Biden’s visit to a state he narrowly won in 2020 also comes a week before Republicans descend on Milwaukee for the party’s first presidential debate. Biden’s visit, his first since February, showcases the importance of Wisconsin in 2024. Wisconsin voted narrowly for Republican Donald Trump in 2016 but flipped to Democrat Biden in 2020.

WASHINGTON (AP) — In a show of preemptive counter-programming, President Joe Biden on Tuesday travels to Wisconsin to highlight his economic policies in a state critical to his reelection fortunes, just a week before Republicans descend on Milwaukee for the party’s first presidential debate.

His trip comes on the eve of the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, major economic legislation that he signed into law with great ceremony but polls show that most people know little about it or what it does.

Wisconsin is among the handful of critical states where Biden needs to persuade voters that his policies are having a positive impact on their lives, and he is expected to visit frequently to make his case.

Biden plans to tour Ingeteam, a clean energy manufacturer of onshore wind turbine generators in Milwaukee, to talk up provisions of the law that spends hundreds of millions of dollars to boost domestic manufacturing and clean energy, lower health care costs and crack down on wealthy tax cheats. Ingeteam plans to hire 100 workers using Bipartisan Infrastructure Law money to start producing EV charging stations domestically, according to the White House.

Also timed to Biden’s trip, multinational tech firm Siemens is set to announce that it will start manufacturing solar inverters in Kenosha County using tax incentives from the IRA law.

Administration officials say the trip is meant to recognize the effects of the law, which passed Congress on party-line votes.

“The president and his team are excited to bring that message to the American people throughout the week,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.

Critics of the legislation say provisions of the law could end up increasing inflation. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said during a virtual Peterson Institute for International Economics event in July that while he supported the IRA, the Biden administration’s overall economic agenda is “increasingly dangerous.”

“I am profoundly concerned by the doctrine of manufacturing-centered economic nationalism that is increasingly being put forth as a general principle to guide policy,” Summers said.

Vice President Kamala Harris and top Cabinet officials will be fanning out across the country this week to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act and its provisions. Biden has scheduled an anniversary event at the White House on Wednesday.

The president’s stop in Wisconsin comes shortly before Republicans hold their first presidential primary debate in Milwaukee on Aug. 23. Former President Donald Trump — the leading Republican candidate in polls so far — has yet to say whether he will boycott or hold a competing event.

Charles Franklin, director of Marquette Law School Poll, said the trip could help Biden win support from independents, who make up about 10% of voters in the state.

“What he really needs to do is get independents in the state to like him a bit better,” Franklin said. “Coming and talking about his achievements, about factories that are working with American jobs — all of that is a good reason to come to speak to those folks in the state who are not partisans.”

“Because Democrats are already behind him,” Franklin said, and “Republicans are almost certainly not going to cross over.”

Democratic gains helped decide a critical state Supreme Court race this spring that moved Wisconsin’s highest court under liberal control for the first time in 15 years.

Republicans, though, will compete aggressively in the state, selecting Milwaukee as the site of its 2024 national nominating convention.

The 2020 Democratic convention was supposed to be held in Milwaukee too, but it largely unfolded virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Biden is one of a string of administration officials making stops across the U.S. this week to promote the legislation’s anniversary.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday spoke in Las Vegas at an International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union hall about “the early results of bold federal action through the IRA” and the administration’s climate agenda.

“The IRA is driving economic growth, expanding economic opportunity and bolstering our resilience,” she said."

Dec 28 2022,"Global economy is heading into a decade of low growth, economist says",CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/28/global-economy-is-heading-into-a-decade-of-low-growth-economist-says.html,"The global economy likely faces a decade of sluggish growth, according to Daniel Lacalle, author and chief economist at Tressis Gestion.

Economies around the world have been grappling with a multitude of shocks — from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to China's persistent zero-Covid measures — that have sent inflation soaring and weakened activity.

The International Monetary Fund now projects that global GDP growth will slow from 6% in 2021 to 3.2% in 2022 and 2.7% in 2023. The Fund characterized this as ""the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the Covid-19 pandemic.""

Meanwhile, global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7% in 2021 to 8.8% this year before declining to 6.5% in 2023 and to 4.1% by 2024, remaining above the target levels for many major central banks.

China offered some solace to economists and market participants on Tuesday, when it officially announced the end of quarantine requirements for inbound travelers on Jan. 8 — symbolizing an end to the zero-Covid policy that it has held for nearly three years.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday, Lacalle said the potential for a full reopening of the Chinese economy was ""the biggest positive"" that markets could expect for 2023."

Apr 26 2022,Beijing’s ‘Zero-COVID’ Threatens China’s Economy,The Epoch Times,right,https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijings-zero-covid-threatens-chinas-economy_4420631.html,"News Analysis

As the Omicron variant is causing a surge in COVID-19 infections across 30 provinces and municipalities in China, Beijing’s “zero-COVID” restrictions appear to be causing more harm than good.

The strict measures are sapping the productivity of businesses, weakening the stock market’s performance, forcing about 400 million people to remain in lockdown, and causing the economy to contract.

Data from China’s multiple indices suggest that the Zero-COVID policy has weakened first-quarter business results and the economy overall.

For example, the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) dropped to 48.1 in March. A reading of under 50 indicates a contraction of China’s manufacturing sector as compared to the previous month. Stock performance, measured by the Shanghai CSI 300 Index and Shenzhen Composite Index, dropped 15 percent and 18 percent, respectively. These were the sharpest quarterly drops since the stock market crash of 2015.

Katherine Jiang, a Hong Kong financial analyst, told the Epoch Times that in 2020, the pandemic was harmful to businesses. Still, most remained optimistic that the virus would be contained and the economy would improve and recover. But this is no longer the case.

According to Jiang, the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) dynamic zero-COVID strategy has disrupted the current production rhythm causing businesses to become less optimistic than before. Company leaders are confused about how long the restrictions will last, and even if Beijing relaxes them at some point, they fear the CCP’s controls can be tightened again at anytime. The uncertainty that permeates China’s business climate is disruptive to confident production planning.

The head of an export firm in Guangdong, the epicenter of China’s manufacturing sector, recently told the Securities Times that while the pandemic had been disruptive to his firm’s production, business planning, materials supply, and transportation, the mandates to contain COVID have become equally disruptive to both businesses and customers.

Guangzhou is the capital of Guangdong Province. To get ahead of COVID’s spread in Guangzhou during the start of April, the city’s Epidemic Prevention and Control Department rushed to impose a zoning control. The department acknowledged that because its disease control experts had acted so swiftly, individuals and businesses did not have enough time to prepare.

Security guards are posted 24-hours a day at the gates of each residential neighborhood and outside residential buildings and businesses to ensure compliance with the zoning restrictions. Once entered, people can’t leave a zone. By April 11 , Guangzhou’s zoning control was unable to contain the virus and the affected area was growing. The restrictions established two types of zones to control people’s movements. A “lockdown zone,” where all stores/services are closed and residents are quarantined in their homes , and a “controlled zone” that allows people to go outside their homes, but closes restaurants and enclosed venues, and people must remain in their neighborhoods.Security guards are posted 24-hours a day at the gates of each residential neighborhood andto ensure compliance with the zoning restrictions. Once entered, people can’t leave a zone.

A similar situation has occurred in Shanghai, as the zero-tolerance restrictions were more disappointing. The city, with a population of over 25 million and over 70,000 foreign companies, has been on lockdown for over 3 weeks, and the lifting of the lockdown is still not in sight despite food shortages and many neighborhoods not having any affected persons for over two weeks. Instead, the municipal government said it would step up enforcement of lockdown measures and adopt nine actions, starting on Friday, to achieve the goal of “no community spread,” a milestone that the city failed to achieve on April 20. The plan is to strictly implement the rules even though government data showed that the outbreak may have peaked. According to the CCP’s Xinhua website, the cosmopolitan metropolis of Shanghai has entered the unprecedented status of “city-wide static management.”

A survey released on April 1 by Shanghai’s American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) found that 99 percent of responding employers had been adversely affected by the widespread restrictions. Of these, 82 percent of U.S. manufacturers reported staffing shortages and deficits in raw materials that have slowed production.

On April 9 , automaker NIO, headquartered in Shanghai, released a statement on its mobile app saying, “Since March, the company’s supply chain partners in Jilin, Shanghai, Jiangsu, and other locations have been shutting down production due to the epidemic and have not yet resumed. As a result, production of the entire line of NIO vehicles has been suspended.”

The aforementioned Jiang said: “The CCP’s strict control over the epidemic has greatly increased the uncertainty faced by enterprises in production. This applies in terms of workforce arrangement, raw material procurement, or even sales and transportation of goods, which can be disrupted at any time. The Caixin manufacturing PMI reported in March that falling into contraction range indicates a significant weakening of the manufacturing boom.”

Not only did the Caixin PMI for manufacturing fall into the contraction range (below 50 percent) in March, but the other PMI released by the CCP’s Bureau of Statistics had also dipped below the 50 percent threshold. In March, the manufacturing PMI, non-manufacturing business activity index, and composite PMI output index were 49.5 percent, 48.4 percent, and 48.8 percent, respectively, down 0.7 percent, 3.2 percent, and 2.4 percent from February. This suggests that China’s economy and overall level of prosperity have become weaker.

Consumption and Investment Confidence Weakened The significance of the pandemic hardships in Shanghai cannot be taken lightly. This is China’s top city for Chinese officials have also admitted that the epidemic and COVID restrictions have simultaneously affected the production and demand sides of China’s economy.The significance of the pandemic hardships in Shanghai cannot be taken lightly. This is China’s top city for consumer product sales , with revenues totaling $288 billion in 2021 . The per capita average consumers spent in Shanghai that year was $7,824, compared to $3,856 across China.

In terms of Shanghai’s economic impact on China, it is ranked the tenth largest among all provinces and municipalities. Although Shanghai occupies only .06 percent of China’s land mass, its $690 GDP represents 3.8 percent of the total GDP.

On April 10 , China News Network, the CCP’s official media outlet, acknowledged that COVID measures in Shanghai had curtailed people’s movement and spending habits. This has had a debilitating effect on the service, tourism, and restaurant industries.

Furthermore, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Index (000001:SH) has fallen precipitously since the start of 2022. The market opened on Jan. 4 at 3,649.15, then dropped 435.82 points and closed at 3,213.33 on April 12.

Jiang observed that “from the companies’ point sof view, consumer expectations directly affect the companies’ ability to operate, while investor expectations directly affect the companies’ ability to raise capital in the market.”

Moreover, she said, “the tightly-controlled zero-COVID policies not only affect demand but also undermine consumer and investor confidence and weaken their expectations. This can lead to consumers’ delaying purchases of non-essential goods and even divestment by investors. This is a big negative impact on business.”

Jiang warned, “If you look at it from a macro perspective, with weak expectations, the economy is not looking good for 2022.”

Sep 07 2022,The service economy is keeping the US from slipping into a recession,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/the-service-economy-is-keeping-the-us-from-slipping-int-1849502785,"As US manufacturing activity slows down, spending on services is keeping the American economy afloat, recent data suggests.

Growth in the services sector accelerated in August for the second month in a row, according to the Institute for Supply Management index released Tuesday. The indicator, which is based on a survey of purchasing and supply executives, came in at 56.9% in August, reaching its highest point in four months. (A reading above 50% denotes expansion.)

Survey responses show a booming services sector as companies benefit from a slowdown in inflation and more reliable supply chains. Executives in a variety of areas, from mining to real estate, reported business is growing. Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting, and arts, entertainment and recreation were the only two sectors to contract.

“Starting to see some cost pressures relief,” said one survey participant in the food services industry. “The overall supply environment is healthy.”

Other data underscore the trend. The personal consumption expenditure report, released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis a couple of weeks ago, showed that, adjusted for inflation, spending on services increased by 0.2% in July compared to June.

To be sure, there are other signs the services sector might not be as strong as the ISM data suggest. Another measure of activity in the area, also released Tuesday, showed a contraction. The S&P services PMI tumbled to 43.7 down from 47.3 in July because of a decrease in new orders. But the ISM index, which goes back further in time, is more closely watched by economists, said Ken Kim, a senior economist at KPMG.

For now, the services sector is helping the US better weather the global slowdown than other countries. As a result, the risks of the US tumbling into a recession are lower than, say, in China or Germany, which rely more heavily on manufacturing.

More demand for services means higher prices.

The positive ISM data add to a mixed economic picture that is likely to complicate deliberations for US Federal Reserve policymakers when they meet to set interest rates on Sept. 21 and 22. Though the pace of inflation has slowed down as energy prices have receded, the labor market remains strong.

And what’s good news for recession watchers is bad news for inflation hawks. As the service sector recovers from its pandemic collapse, Fed economists expect prices for everything from rent to healthcare to increase—just as inflation for goods was slowing down."

He has work to do to convince Black voters he deserves a second term.

Biden and congressional Democrats are focused on swinging public opinion to their side as they try to strike a debt ceiling deal with Republicans, just as Biden departed Wednesday for a G-7 summit in Japan.

But as he deals with record-low approval ratings and stubbornly high inflation, Black voters — a key bloc loyal to Democrats — remain restless after fewer among them voted in November.

Black voters posted a 51.7 percent participation rate in the 2018 election, but only 42 percent cast a ballot in 2022, according to data released earlier this month by the U.S. Census Bureau. A key part of the so-called Obama coalition, analysts and strategists say Biden cannot win a second term unless he can convince more Black voters to head to their local polling station in a year-and-a-half.

“We’ve been asking black voters, ‘Has your life gotten better under President Biden?’ and 6o to 70 percent say no,” Jermaine House, senior director of communications at HIT Strategies, a consulting firm that works with underrepresented communities, said during a phone interview.

“Clearly, many Black voters understand in 2018 and 2020 … they delivered Congress and the White House to Democrats,” he added. “They’re looking for a return on their investment, but they just don’t see one.”

Biden tried to convince some members of that community on Saturday that he has done things that benefit them — and that he hears their concerns. “Your generation will not be ignored, will not be shunned, will not be silenced,” he said during a commencement address at Howard University in Washington, D.C.

The president used one phrase several times during one part of his remarks — “because of you” — to drive home to students at the historically Black research university that he again needs their support in 2024.

“With your voices and votes, I was able to fill my commitment to put the first Black woman on the Supreme Court of the United States of America,” he said. “Because of you, more Black women have been appointed to the federal appellate courts … than under every other president in American history — combined.

“And, by the way, I mean it. I mean it. Because of you. Because of you. You turned out. You spoke up. You knew. You showed up, and the votes counted,” Biden added. “You feel the promise and the peril of climate change. Because of you, we’re making the biggest investment ever in the history of the world in climate change. Don’t ever think your voice doesn’t matter.”

Top priorities

Climate change is an issue that resonates most with the most progressive and youngest parts of the Democratic base. But what about Black voters? “Gun control legislation, white supremacy and economy top priorities for Black voters,” read the headline of a press release from HIT Strategies and the Black to the Future Action Fund that summarized a poll released March 15.

Forty-four percent of respondents told the organizations they want Washington to enact some kind of gun control legislation, while 42 percent said they want white supremacy declared a national security threat, according to the survey of 1,200 Black voters in Georgia, North Carolina and California.

The March poll also hit on a lack of motivation among some Black voters in last November’s midterm elections, with 18 percent saying they did not cast a ballot. North Carolina had the highest rate among respondents (22 percent), followed by Georgia (14 percent) and California (18 percent).

Paradoxically, many Black voters during focus groups say they support the policies Biden and congressional Democrats have made law since January 2021. They may not be “connecting the dots” between that view and the president’s job performance, House said, and that is “a messaging challenge that the White House and many Democrats have.”

Diving deeper into the Census Bureau data shows the decline in Black voter participation in 2022 is driven by younger voters in that group.

“Many voters haven’t been keen on Joe Biden since he ran. Young voters had other motivations than just Joe Biden. They had a strong aversion to Trump, who was in office in 2018. They also felt strongly about the racial justice issue in 2020,” House said. “Without those two factors, a lot more work has to be done to make sure young voters come back in 2024.”

An ABC News-Washington Post poll released this month also highlighted what could be a problem for Biden in 2024. On his job performance, the president is underwater with “non-white” voters: 42 percent approve of his performance, while 48 percent disapprove. On the economy, 48 percent of the key-for-Democrats voting bloc think Donald Trump handled economic issue more competently during his term, compared to 41 percent who sided with Biden’s economic stewardship.

When asked about a hypothetical 2024 Biden-Trump rematch, 45 percent chose the incumbent. But the number of “non-whites” who said they would vote right now for Trump is higher than one might think: 33 percent — with another 17 percent undecided. That’s 50 percent of “non-whites” not in Biden’s camp. At the moment, at least.

“Black men are on the margins; we have seen them voting more and more for Republicans since Barack Obama left office … and that has led to a number down-ballot wins,” House said. “Every year, we see a marginal jump in Black men voting Republican. These voters need to be treated like swing voters. … For Democrats to win in 2024, they have to have close to what Barack Obama achieved with Black voters. Democrats have to treat them with the same respect as white swing voters.”

Kingmaker Clyburn

So even though Vice President Kamala Harris is a proud Howard University graduate, it is no surprise that Biden himself turned up there to address graduates. Nor was it a surprise Harris this week huddled with what her office described as “more than 35 young men of color who are entrepreneurs and business owners.”

And it’s no coincidence that early in his remarks, Biden gave a shout out to an icon in Democratic circles: Rep. James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a leading Black voice on Capitol Hill who also delivered Biden a boost in the 2020 Democratic primary with an endorsement that sent Biden on a delegate run.

“To my friend — and he is my friend — Congressman Jim Clyburn, the thing that I admire most about you, Jim, is your absolute integrity in everything you do — in everything you do. This is a man of honor,” Biden said to applause. “Jim, it’s an honor to join you here today and receive an honorary degree from this great university.”

Biden’s campaign plans remain murky, but the Howard speech was the kind of outreach House said is needed if the president hopes to retain this part of his winning 2020 coalition. Democrats need “year-round engagement” with this bloc rather than trying to reach them a few months before Election Day, he said.

House is not alone in that view.

“There’s a legitimacy … to the Biden reelection campaign, but he has to tap into it. He also needs to turn all of those Democratic governors and senators and others into real strong surrogates to get out there and hit the road,” former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile, told ABC News on May 7.

“Because I’m telling you, when you see that number with Black voters, let me just tell you … had our ex-ex-ex-President [Bill] Clinton saw those numbers,” she said, “he would have called us at 12:01 [a.m.] and said: ‘Get out there and start working.'”

Jul 11 2023,"With a world-class workforce and a booming economy, North Carolina repeats as America's Top State for Business in 2023",CNBC,center,https://cnbc.com/2023/07/11/north-carolina-is-top-state-for-business-led-by-workforce-economy-.html,"watch now

At a time when companies are clamoring for workers while trying to navigate a treacherous economy, no state is meeting their needs more effectively than North Carolina. The Tar Heel State is America's Top State for Business in CNBC's annual competitiveness study. It is the second consecutive year at the top for North Carolina — a rare feat in the CNBC study, which launched in 2007. Business and the economy in the state have been on a tear since the pandemic, and the state has scarcely looked back. In 2023 alone, the state has amassed a trophy case full of economic development wins, ranging from a $130 million investment by Bosch to expand its power tool manufacturing facility in Lincolnton, to a $458 million biomanufacturing facility to be built in Greensboro by cellular therapeutics company ProKidney, and even a $58 million turkey production facility in Goldsboro by poultry breeder Select Genetics. The projects come on top of major wins last year, including Vietnamese electric vehicle manufacturer VinFast announcing it will build its first North American plant in the state, and Durham-based semiconductor materials manufacturer Wolfspeed expanding its operations there.

Last month, Apple filed applications to begin work on its $1 billion facility in the famed Research Triangle Park announced in 2021, with 700,000 square feet of office space in its initial phase. It is Apple's first hub on the East Coast. A common thread through all the projects is people. ""Our talented, educated workers are the foundation of our economic success,"" said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, in his state of the state address in March. The numbers bear that out. North Carolina ranks first in the all-important Workforce category of CNBC's study. In particular, the state is a leader in attracting and retaining talent across a range of industries, said Josh Wright, an executive vice president with labor market analytics firm Lightcast, which provided some of the data for the CNBC study.

""Charlotte is seeing a lot of growth in the financial sector,"" he said. ""But it's not just a one-trick pony. You've got the Raleigh-Durham area. You've got massive, major, internationally well-known universities driving growth."" The state is also a leader in career education. ""You have one of the most competitive community college systems in America as well in North Carolina, that is attuned to the needs of their industry,"" Wright said. In addition, more than 89% of participants in state worker training programs were employed within six months, according to U.S. Labor Department data. That is the third-best record in the country, after Alaska and Massachusetts. Strong workers fuel GDP, solid state finances North Carolina's strong workforce helped feed its performance in other categories. The state finishes No. 3 in Economy. Its $560 billion gross domestic product grew by a healthy 3.2% last year, though growth has leveled off at the beginning of 2023, according to the Commerce Department. State finances are solid; its debt rating is top-notch, according to Moody's. And North Carolina's housing market appears to be handling the influx of new residents with minimal stress. Home prices surged by more than 13% last year, according to the Federal Housing Financing Agency, putting a dent in affordability. But home builders are picking up the slack, with housing starts among the highest in the nation, according to the Census Bureau. However, an uptick in foreclosures, according to figures from ATTOM Data Solutions, bears watching. North Carolina also finishes strong in Technology & Innovation and Access to Capital, both at No. 6. Political tensions pressure education, quality of life The state had a strong showing in education, at No. 7, but in May, Cooper declared a state of emergency in the state's public education system. It is a sign that the political detente that has helped the state achieve its business success may have come to an end. ""It's clear that the Republican legislature is aiming to choke the life out of public education,"" Cooper said on May 24. ""I'm declaring this a state of emergency because you need to know what's happening."" The declaration, which has no legal effect, came after Republicans introduced a plan to expand vouchers and charter schools, which the governor said will divert critical funding from public education. A key sponsor of the legislation is state Rep. Tricia Cotham, who switched from Democrat to Republican in April, giving the GOP a supermajority in the General Assembly. ""We have to evolve, and I believe that the state is changing,"" Cotham said in unveiling the school choice legislation. ""One size fits all in education is wrong for children."" Already, the newly empowered legislature has passed a 12-week abortion ban over the governor's veto. The law took effect on July 1. Because this year's CNBC rankings consider reproductive rights as a metric in Life, Health & Inclusion, the ban hurts the state's already poor ranking in the category. It finishes No. 34 in the category, down from No. 28 in 2022.

In addition to the abortion ban, North Carolina is one of just five states in which statewide protections against discrimination apply only to people with disabilities, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Gov. Cooper says North Carolina's abortion restrictions are not as severe as states to the South and West of it, but he said states where culture wars are raging, and in particular Southeastern states that have made economic gains, will see long-term problems because they are limiting their workforce. ""We are not here to fight Mickey Mouse. We are here to fight for jobs,"" Cooper said in an interview on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday morning. ""You still see people going to Florida and Texas, but you begin to see deterioration over time. Site selectors will tell you these issues matter when it comes time for businesses to make tough decisions,"" he said. It is not only about attracting the largest corporations to expand into a state, according to Cooper, but about the development of new businesses and innovative businesses that states wants to attract. ""That's why it is critical to battle,"" he said. Violent crime is also on the rise, according to FBI statistics. And the state ranks poorly for health care, with low public health funding and a high number of people without health insurance, according to the United Health Foundation. Scoring all 50 states The CNBC study measures all 50 states across 10 categories of competitiveness, for a total of 2,500 possible points. North Carolina scores 1,628 points to capture this year's crown. Our methodology assigns a weight to each category based on how frequently states cite it as a selling point. The idea is to measure the states based on the criteria they use to pitch themselves to business. Here are this year's categories and point totals: Workforce: 400 points (16%)

Infrastructure: 390 points (15.6%)

Economy: 360 points (14.4%)

Life, Health & Inclusion: 350 points (14%)

Cost of Doing Business: 290 points (11.6%)

Technology & Innovation: 270 points (10.8%)

Business Friendliness: 215 points (8.6%)

Education: 125 points (5%)

Access to Capital: 50 points (2%)

Cost of Living: 50 points (2%) The contenders

Mardi Gras in New Orleans is back in full swing this year. Hundreds of thousands of revelers will be in the city as local businesses are still dealing with the volatile post-pandemic economy.

JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:

Mardi Gras is back. Parades in New Orleans were called off in 2021 because of COVID, and they were shortened in 2022, so this year is the first full-blown Mardi Gras since before the pandemic. But local businesses are still dealing with the weird, volatile post-pandemic economy. WWNO's Carly Berlin has the story.

CARLY BERLIN, BYLINE: At Loretta's Authentic Pralines, an industrial-sized standing mixer churns a batch of sweet-smelling dough.

(SOUNDBITE OF MIXER WHIRRING)

BERLIN: It's one step in the process of crafting the season's beloved king cakes.

ROBERT HARRISON: Oh, Jerry (ph), how many cakes can you get out of one batch?

BERLIN: Fifty king cakes in this batch. Robert Harrison runs the day-to-day operations at this family business. He says they're selling more than three times as many king cakes a day, and the pace just keeps picking up the closer Fat Tuesday gets. A key ingredient in the recipe - eggs.

HARRISON: Well, guess what? Eggs have went up.

BERLIN: Last time Harrison looked at an invoice from his supplier, his eyes popped. His egg order cost 2 1/2 times what it used to. The impacts of avian flu in chickens, along with inflation, have caused the price of a dozen to skyrocket. But just as high as the prices is the demand for the king cakes.

HARRISON: There is no substitute for eggs. I mean, it is one of the most critical ingredients in a king cake for bakers everywhere. But we've still gotten that - OK. Well, we have 2 1/2 times the amount of customers buying king cakes, almost three times.

BERLIN: Harrison thinks it's partly because this year is the first full-blown Mardi Gras since 2020. And because of that, he hasn't raised prices. It also helps that not all the king cake staples went up.

HARRISON: They haven't went up on the babies that go in the king cake, so that's a great thing.

BERLIN: Those little plastic babies, part of any king cake you get here - they have to come from somewhere. And getting them to New Orleans, along with the beads and other random trinkets the people on floats throw down to parade-goers - that's the job of Mark Flood. He shows off some shiny necklaces with beads the size of baseballs that are flying off the shelf.

MARK FLOOD: These are like an ornament. They're called blow molds. It's 'cause they're hollow. But these are very popular.

BERLIN: Flood owns TJ's Carnival and Mardi Gras Supplies, one of many local shops in the business of selling Mardi Gras stuff. And how does it all get here?

FLOOD: Slow boat from China.

BERLIN: Yeah.

FLOOD: That's about it. Everything comes from China.

BERLIN: And getting all this here in time for Mardi Gras hasn't gone smoothly this year. COVID is still slowing down shipments out of China. They've been coming in months behind schedule, and that's left Flood scrambling.

FLOOD: Rushing to get it unloaded and then get it on the floor and sell it, selling product before it was here. It's - that's not good, not fun playing catch-up - still doing it right now.

BERLIN: And the later his shipments come in, the more expensive they get, which is tough because he tries to have the cheapest prices.

FLOOD: That hits the bottom line, you know?

BERLIN: On top of all that, he is short-staffed, so he'll be hustling up until Fat Tuesday, which he says will be his first day off this year. For NPR News, I'm Carly Berlin in New Orleans.

May 17 2023,"CT must add more affordable housing to build its economy, Lamont says",Hartford Courant,center,https://courant.com/2023/05/17/ct-must-add-more-affordable-housing-to-build-its-economy-lamont-says,"With just three weeks before the General Assembly must approve a budget, Gov. Ned Lamont is stepping up his campaign for hundreds of millions of dollars to spur new affordable housing around the state.

Lamont pitched his case to a convention of realtors on Tuesday, then showed up Wednesday morning in Newington to praise the Cedar Pointe complex that will add 100 affordable apartments when it’s built.

The phenomenal surge of apartment construction in the past two years has been what Lamont calls “a housing renaissance for our state,” but his administration is pressing to attract developers to build more for individuals and families with below-average wages.

“We’ve had more market-rate housing built last year than any time in this century. People want to be in Connecticut, but you need a whole variety of different types of housing. If you want to make the state more affordable, it starts with housing,” Lamont said at a press conference at the construction site off Cedar Street.

But affordable housing, generally considered available to someone making less than 80% of the region’s average income, hasn’t kept pace.

Over the next two years, Lamont wants to roughly double the money earmarked for incentives to builders and some entry-level homebuyers. As part of setting the new state budget, lawmakers will decide by June how much of his $600 million proposal goes forward.

Lamont wants $200 million to expand incentives for so-called workforce housing, which would target renters with making 60 to 120% of the area’s media income. If that component passes, Lamont’s staff projects it would generate an additional 2,000 new apartments.

He also proposes $100 million for the Housing Trust Fund, which encourages multifamily housing in downtowns near public transit; $200 million for flexible housing; and $100 million for Connecticut’s Time-To-Own incentive that gives down payment aid to low- and moderate-income homebuyers.

James Krupienski, acting town manager of Newington, said the community is eager to add Cedar Pointe, which is located just blocks from a CTfastrak station.

“The town has been working hard over the past few years to increase our housing stock in conjunction with the state,” said Krupienski, who added that the new project benefits current residents as well as people looking to relocate to Newington.

Robert Arista, a principal in Massachusetts-based Dakota Partners, said one of his company’s goals in building Cedar Pointe is to provide “a nice place to live, a beautiful place to live” for tenants who can’t afford the market-rate and luxury housing that represents the heart of the current housing boon.

Cedar Pointe expects the first units to be occupied as early as September The first phase will have 72 apartments with a pair of three-story garden-style buildings along a community amenities building. The units will be a mix of one- and two-bedrooms.

The company expects to begin the second phases later this year with a single 36-unit building.

“This is 108 units. Almost all of them are affordable, some have support services for folks with special needs. I want to be sure Newington and the state support all of our people going forward,” Lamont said. “Every single business leader I talk to says it’s great you have workforce training, but where are they going to live? It’s an absolutely necessity in terms of workforce.”

State funding can help developers with gap financing through various programs, the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority provides tax credits in a competitive program, and brownfields remediation and historic preservation aid are also available to developers under some circumstances.

“With rising interest rates, this can be more important than ever,” Lamont said."

Dec 06 2022,Almost everyone expects a recession. Could the economy avoid one?,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/11/29/economy-recession-federal-reserve/,"Joe Shamie hears plenty of talk of a looming recession. But his business just isn’t feeling it. Shamie expects a decent holiday season for his company, Delta Children, which sells strollers, cribs, bassinets and other baby furniture. He’s encouraged that global supply chains are clearing up and borders are gradually loosening. From his New York City headquarters, he has no plans to cut staff and would hire more people if the right candidates come along.

“People and businesses create their own self-fulfilling prophecy: you expect the worst, you end up creating the worst,” Shamie said. “I laugh because sometimes I sit with some of my friends, talking about how bad it is. And I say, ‘We’re at a gorgeous restaurant, spending tons of money.’ I look left and right, and say, ‘Ah, things don’t look so bad. And yet, you’re complaining.’ ”

That same divide pervades the whole economy, as people brace for a looming downturn — but aren’t yet feeling one in their daily lives. The overwhelming view among economists and Fed watchers is that the country is barreling toward a recession. And experts have good reason for the doom and gloom: The Fed is in the middle of an all-out effort to bring down dangerously high inflation, hiking interest rates at the most aggressive pace in decades. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell will speak at the Brookings Institution, where he’s expected to set the stage for smaller rate hikes in the coming weeks and months while reinforcing the Fed’s commitment to taming inflation.

Yet the feared recession still hasn’t arrived. Ever since the Fed started aggressively hiking interest rates in March, crucial pillars of the economy have stayed remarkably strong. The economy grew in the third quarter after shrinking in the first half of the year. Gas prices are ticking down. Companies are still eager to hire workers. And for many businesses and households planning for the future, a slowdown just doesn’t seem imminent.

Powell and his colleagues say they will be guided by the economic data, and this week will offer plenty to analyze. New government figures on October job openings come out on Wednesday, and the November jobs report comes out on Friday. But for months, the Fed’s resounding message has made clear that officials will not stop until prices come back down to normal levels, and as a result, the chances of avoiding a recession are slimming.

“With baseline growth that’s only modest growth over this year and next, negative shocks to the global economy, or to our economy, clearly could tip us into a recession,” New York Fed President John Williams told reporters on Monday. “I hope that’s not the case. But that’s clearly a risk out there given all the uncertainty in the global economic outlook.”

For now, though, observers see more and more reason to hope that a painful recession may not come.

Last week, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international group, said the global economy should avoid a recession next year, though European economies will still slow significantly as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to send energy prices spiking.

Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs’ chief economist put the odds of a U.S. recession in the next year at 35 percent — far below other forecasts so far. The thinking is that growth will slow but remain positive; the labor market could avoid massive layoffs; wage growth could simmer down; and inflation could be on a path to more normal levels.

“We still see a very plausible, non-recessionary, four-step path from the high-inflation economy of the present to a low-inflation economy of the future,” Goldman’s Jan Hatzius wrote in an analyst note.

The labor market and consumer spending have yet to crater despite the Fed’s rate hikes. Employers added 261,000 jobs in October, edging down after growing like gangbusters in the first half of the year, but still showing overall strength. Employers remain desperate to hire: the number of job openings rose in September compared with the month before, to 10.7 million.

Consumer spending — which usually makes up 70 percent of economic activity — is also robust as the holiday season gets underway. Retail sales rose sharply in October, according to the Commerce Department. Shoppers are paying higher prices for basics like gas and food. But they also continue to spend on items like cars, furniture and dining out. Consumer sentiment has also improved since plummeting over the summer, when gas prices topped $5 per gallon. Prices at the pump have steadily ticked down, and on Monday, the national average was $3.54 per gallon, according to AAA — down more than 10 cents per gallon from the week before, but still higher than this time last year, before the Ukraine war.

Corporate earnings calls have also gotten more upbeat. According to research by FactSet published Nov. 18, the number of S&P 500 companies citing the term “recession” on earnings calls in the third quarter dropped by 26 percent compared with the second quarter.

Of course, not all parts of the economy have been spared, and the full weight of rate hikes here and abroad won’t be felt until next year. But the housing market was quick to respond. Buyer demand has slowed significantly as mortgage rates soar, helping prices fall as “For Sale” signs linger. Silicon Valley, too, has been hit by waves of layoffs and hiring freezes, including at big names like Meta and Amazon (whose founder, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post).

No one doubts the pain high inflation has inflicted on people’s own budgets, and the disproportionate consequences felt by lower-income households. More people are turning to retirement savings for cash, according to new research by Vanguard. Fiona Greig, Vanguard’s global head of investor research and policy, wrote last week that a recent rise in households drawing down on their employer-sponsored retirement accounts “could be a sign of some deterioration in the financial health of the U.S. consumer.”

Yet some economists and policymakers say there’s a divide between how badly people perceive the economy to be and how they respond. Curtis Dubay, chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to a paradox dubbed “secondhand pessimism,” where people sour on the economy but don’t change their own behavior.

“Businesses and consumers feel the economy is slowing, or is not in good shape, but their actions don’t follow with that,” Dubay said. “Consumers continue to spend … On the business side, they say, ‘The economy is bad, and it’s going to get worse, but our specific situation is good.’ ”

Inflation may well explain this gap. High prices, and the central bank’s fight to tame them, bring an inescapable amount of uncertainty for families and the broader economy, said Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed.

Daly said that as she travels around her district — which spans nine western states and is the Fed system’s largest district both by geography and by the size of its economy — she hears that “people’s own situations feel different than the situations they fear are out there, or that they even see out there.” A business may have found creative ways to make its margins, for example, but knows others that can’t.

“[Inflation] creates this sense of anxiety that the economy can just tip over at any point in time, because anyone knows it’s unsustainable,” Daly told reporters last week. “As the Fed acts to bring it down, that creates uncertainty.”

“We’re in a high-uncertainty time, which is going to add to that sense of foreboding,” Daly added.

Americans feel the anxiety. A closely watched survey of consumers released by the University of Michigan this month said that along with the ongoing impact of inflation, consumers’ attitudes have been “weighed down by rising borrowing costs, declining asset values, and weakening labor market expectations.”

For now, Shamie, of Delta Children, is staying optimistic. He knows the economy could turn quickly. Parents may have to rethink a new play set if inflation continues to climb, or if the economy slows abruptly. But so far, he’s sticking to his plans."
Dec 01 2022,India Will Surpass Japan And Germany As The World’s Third Largest Economy,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/india-will-surpass-japan-and-germany-as-the-worlds-third-largest-economy,"India is projected to surpass Japan and Germany as the world’s third-largest economy in the next decade, according to a forecast from ratings agency S&P Global.

The real gross domestic product of India will average 6.3% yearly growth between fiscal years 2021 and 2030, enabling the country to surpass Japan and Germany in nominal terms. Real GDP per capita will grow at a 5.3% rate as the population of India continues to expand.

“These projections assume continued structural reforms, including trade and financial liberalization, infrastructure and human capital investment, and labor market reform,” wrote the S&P Global analysts. “Although the current government has a parliamentary majority to pass legislation, trade unions are strong, comprise millions of members in sectors highlighted for liberalization, and have routinely opposed policies that they claim threaten job security and increase the influence of big business.”

India had a real GDP of $3.2 trillion as of last year, according to data from the World Bank, while the value of finished goods and services in Japan and Germany respectively amounted to $4.9 trillion and $4.2 trillion. The United States and China are the world’s first and second largest economies, with real output of $23 trillion and $17.7 trillion respectively.

After India gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, widespread refugee travel between India and Pakistan provided continued economic strain. India has experienced robust growth since the nation pivoted away from socialism and liberalized trade policy.

The Indian government introduced the Production Linked Incentive Schemes two years ago, a policy regime that encourages foreign and domestic investors to achieve higher manufacturing output through tax rebates, project-specific land acquisition, and license clearance. “A greater share in global value chains would also contribute to India’s goals of improving leverage in multilateral negotiations and gaining advantage in its competition with mainland China,” the S&P Global analysts continued.

India is also slated to eclipse longtime geopolitical rival China as the world’s most populous country next year. The former nation presently maintains a fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman, while the latter has a fertility rate of 1.7 children per woman, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

India currently boasts a trade surplus with the United States and a trade deficit with China, the latter of which is viewed as a vulnerability among Indian officials. The dynamic “encourages policymakers to seek alternatives, particularly in pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and electronics, where the aim is to make India a major exporter itself,” according to S&P Global.

India had been experiencing benefits from “small but steady annual increases in economic freedom” before the lockdown-induced recession two years ago, according to a report from the Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom, which ranks the country “mostly unfree.” The nation still has lackluster court systems, investment freedom, and government integrity.

“India’s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming, industrial-scale agriculture, handicrafts, and a wide range of modern industries,” the conservative think tank remarked, noting the importance of internationalization for the nation’s future. “Capitalizing on its well-educated English-speaking population, India has become a major exporter of information technology services, business outsourcing services, and software workers.”"

Aug 12 2022,Republicans Are Outraged at Joe Biden for Accurately Describing the Economy,Slate,left,https://slate.com/business/2022/08/biden-zero-inflation-republicans-economy.html,"Along with critical race theory, “wokeness,” the deep state, and other recent conservative obsessions, it appears we can now add the basic language of economics to the list of things Republicans have decided to go to war on.

Take the latest round of inflation statistics. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. got its first bit of truly good news about the rising cost of living this year. The Consumer Price Index, which has been surging in recent months, remained essentially flat in July. That was largely thanks to tumbling gas prices, which canceled out rising costs elsewhere. (Technically, the index actually declined a tiny amount, but the change rounded to zero.)

Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, and is watched closely by economists and the markets, rose at a 3.8 percent annual rate, its lowest reading since September 2021.

At a White House press conference, President Joe Biden unsurprisingly took a moment to celebrate the welcome reprieve. “Today we received news that our economy had 0 percent inflation in the month of July,” he said. “Zero percent. Here’s what that means. While the price of some things went up last month, the price of other things went down by the same amount. The result, 0 inflation last month.”

Biden then added a slightly wonky flourish, noting that core inflation rose at its slowest rate in “several months.”

Now, personally, I think the president is at risk of spiking the football early here. While today’s inflation report was certainly welcome news, the month-to-month data can be erratic and reading too much into a single report can be hazardous. (I mean, trust me.) Nonetheless, everything Biden said was strictly accurate. Overall prices did not rise in July, meaning that inflation for the month was zero.

Republicans nonetheless erupted in furor and mockery. In tweet after tweet and article after article, right-leaning journalists, GOP officials, and party operatives accused of Biden of lying or misleading the public, since inflation is still up 8.5 percent over the past 12 months. “Ridiculous BS from the White House,” Sen. Ted Cruz huffed in a characteristic tweet. “There’s 8.5% inflation and basically everything anyone ever buys went up in price. This is just cruel gaslighting from the Biden admin.” Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee managed to wrap in some transphobia, tweeting that, “In Joe Biden’s America, men are women, and 8.5% inflation = 0% inflation.” Classy.

When journalists widely pointed out that what Biden said was basically accurate, conservatives promptly accused them of being patsies for the administration. “I’m trying to imagine the pitch and volume of outrage from journos right now, if it was a GOP admin that produced this economy, and was now trying to redefine recession and declare ‘zero inflation,’” Cruz adviser Omri Ceren complained. “It would send moons and planets across the solar system hurling out of orbit.”

This is all predictable enough—Republicans of course want to emphasize the economy’s troubles—but silly. It makes sense to cite the rate of inflation from the past 12 months when you want to talk about the cost of living versus a year before, which is what most families care about. But it’s totally acceptable to cite the one-month change in prices if you want to convey how much inflation is speeding up or slowing down in real time. I’ve often done it after particularly bad reports to highlight that prices were accelerating. You can accuse Biden of omitting context, but he isn’t lying, making things up, or violating any kind of longstanding practice by economists and journalists.

This is now the second month in a row in which conservatives have thrown a fit over economic lingo. In July, the right collectively excoriated journalists and the Biden administration for supposedly attempting to redefine the meaning of the word “recession,” after the most recent batch of gross domestic product numbers showed the economy had contracted for the second quarter in a row. According to a commonly used rule of thumb, which you will often hear repeated by Wall Street traders, two quarters of negative growth qualifies as a recession. But Biden told reporters that we were “not in a recession.”

That’s because, officially, we are not. The task of deciding when recessions begin and end traditionally falls to the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee. The group of esteemed economists isn’t an official government office, but professionals rely on it as the final arbiters when it comes to this topic. The committee defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months,” which they clock “based on a range of monthly measures” including income, spending, and hiring, among others.

This is a significantly fuzzier definition than the two-quarter rule, but it’s also a sensible one. GDP is just one number that can be nudged up or down by a variety of factors, and it makes sense to take a holistic view of the state of the economy. Technically, the U.S. never experienced two consecutive quarters of contracting GDP after the dot com bubble burst in the early 2000s, but between the choppy growth and job losses that ensued, the period was counted as a recession. Right now, we’re experiencing an inverse situation: The economy is technically shrinking, but employers are still on a hiring binge. It’s hard to really call that a downturn, though who knows, it might turn into one, eventually.

Nonetheless, Biden’s insistence that, no, we are not in an official recession left the right apoplectic. The fight online boiled over to the point where Wikipedia had to halt edits by new editors on its page for the term recession. Conservatives accused Biden of “governing by gaslighting.” Mind you, this is coming from a movement in thrall to a former president who lied about everything from the size of his inauguration crowd to the outcome of the 2020 election. The word chutzpah is inadequate.

Anyway, as an economics writer, this is all obviously exhausting, since talking about my beat using basic terminology now results in my mentions being flooded with accusations of being a propagandistic stooge. But I expect these kinds of fights will repeat if Biden gets additional good news he wants to trumpet. Such is life."
Mar 24 2021,"If the Economy Overheats, How Will We Know?",New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/upshot/economy-inflation-overheating.html?action=click&module=Spotlight&pgtype=Homepage,"Some big-name economists argue that the economy will soon overheat because of the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion pandemic relief and other spending measures.

They worry that the economy is being flooded with too much money, a fear only heightened by news that the administration will seek $3 trillion more to build infrastructure, cut carbon emissions and reduce inequality.

But in this debate, what overheating would mean — exactly how much inflation, with what kinds of side effects for the economy — has often been vague. So The New York Times asked some prominent participants in the Great Overheating Debate of 2021 to lay out in more detail what they are afraid of, and how we will know if their fears have been realized. See their full answers here.

It turns out that the two sides — the overheating worriers and those who think those concerns are misplaced — agree on many points. They have common ground on what a bad outcome might look like, and agree that it will take some time to know whether a problematic form of inflation is really taking root. The differences are in how likely they consider it to happen."

Nov 21 2018,Polarized Politics In The Scrooge Economy,Socialist Worker,not-yet-rated,https://socialistworker.org/2018/11/21/polarized-politics-in-the-scrooge-economy,"November 21, 2018

Lance Selfa , editor of U.S. Politics in an Age of Uncertainty , a collection of essays on the Trump era, looks at the factors that underlie both hardening right-wing support for Trump and a swing to the Democrats in the midterm elections.

PERHAPS THE most often-used words to describe U.S. politics in the Trump era are “polarization” and “volatility.”

Both were on display during the November 6 midterm election: The majority of the electorate swung sharply against Trump and the Republicans (volatility), while the high midterm turnout showed that the bases of both mainstream political parties mobilized (polarization).

Perhaps this outcome isn’t too surprising given the uniquely vile nature of the Trump regime and its dalliance with the far right.

But it’s remarkable that the Republicans lost as badly as they did considering the economic climate that provided a backdrop to the election. The party of the White House incumbent traditionally loses seats in the first midterm election, but the party “in power” also historically benefits from a strong economy. Clearly, Trump and the Republicans didn’t get that economic bump.

An unusual but interesting economic analysis by Barry Ritholtz factored in economic conditions with the election results and concluded that no president in the last 100 years has fared worse in a midterm congressional election at a time of economic expansion and declining unemployment.

Election 2018 may have been “all about Trump,” but it turned out to be the latest “wave” election — of which there have been, arguably, four in the recent past: 2006, 2008, 2010, 2014. American political institutions have been known for their decades of stability, so this recent past represents a noteworthy level of polarization and volatility.

OPINION POLLS show that voters increasingly interpret their personal financial situation, their rating of the national economy and their sense of whether the U.S. is on the “right track” or “wrong track” through a partisan lens.

So in these midterms, two-thirds of voters said they thought the economy was “excellent or good,” but 75 percent of Democrats said it was “not so good or poor.”

The polarization of the U.S. electorate is usually explained as a decades-long process of political coalitions reforming around the Democratic and Republican Parties.

For Republicans, the backlash against the civil rights movement and Richard Nixon’s “Southern strategy” solidified the migration of conservative white Southerners from the Dixiecrat wing of the Democratic Party to the Republicans. The “Reagan revolution” of the early 1980s helped extinguish what used to be called the liberal/moderate “Rockefeller Republican” wing of the GOP.

This made the Republicans and their voting bloc much more uniformly conservative. And despite the hopes of socialists who looked for a “realignment” of the Democratic Party into a more consistently liberal formation, the flight of the Dixiecrats opened the door to “new Democrats” like Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, who shifted more decisively toward the pro-business right on economic policy.

For the last 40 years, mainstream politics in the U.S. has oscillated between a center-right Democratic Party and a firmly right Republican Party.

But just focusing on the politics at the top of the two main parties doesn’t actually provide insight into how voters (and nonvoters) polarize along standard left-right measures.

On this point, there is evidence linking the growth of economic inequality to political polarization, according to Stanford University researcher Christos Makridis:

[T]he evidence indicates not only a strong correlation between income inequality and political polarization but also potential causality: Greater income inequality can amplify political tensions by raising polarization. These results imply that income inequality can indirectly affect economic outcomes by increasing the fraction of people who identify as extreme liberal.

That the political system doesn’t necessarily register this increase in “extreme liberals” may point to two other well-established findings: that poorer people with more liberal views tend to be nonvoters, and that the political system reflects the views of the wealthy much more than those of the non-wealthy.

WITH OFFICIAL unemployment rates down to levels not seen since the late 1960s, and with median household income finally recovering after a “lost decade” since the Great Recession, you might think that the midterm elections would reward the incumbent party.

But that certainly wasn’t the case in 2018. In fact, the midterm electorate “threw the bums out” — at least in the House, and in a good number of state races for executive and legislative office — and for the fourth time in the last 12 years. If election results are crude measure of the public mood, they indicate a restless public.

This volatility is easier to understand if you look behind the headline economic data to the realities that they hide and to the long-term trends that they ignore.

Despite the economic recovery and the currently tight labor market, financial stress stalks millions of Americans who still have trouble keeping up with their bills. Workers may be able to (barely) get by, but any future economic downturn will expose millions to a financial reversal.

One such “canary in a coal mine” came from a recent New York Federal Reserve report on household debt. The percentage of debt that moved into delinquency increased from 4.5 percent of total debt in the second quarter of 2018 to 4.7 percent, the largest quarterly increase in seven years.

Those percentages may not sound like much, but they amount to bad debt of $638 billion — most of which involved student loans going into default. Meanwhile, auto loan delinquency has been steadily increasing since 2012.

There are plenty more sobering economic statistics: Eighty percent of U.S. workers live paycheck to paycheck. Just under half of Americans would be unable to come up with $400 if they needed it fin an emergency. The 2008 housing crash cost a generation millions in lost wealth. Unaffordable childcare costs burden families. The median retirement account savings for workers 55 and older is $15,000, about a year’s worth of income for an individual at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.

Journalist Ron Brownstein summarized the situation this way in 2016: “The 2008 downturn — and the slow, unevenly distributed recovery that has marked its aftermath — crystallized for many Americans a new normal, one that presents them with reduced economic security and heightened risk even while it provides them with new opportunities and flexibility.”

The Great Recession exposed how social provision and workplace rights and benefits have eroded over the long term, the hallmark of government policy as it has been shaped by free-market ideology for a generation.

As political scientist Jacob Hacker wrote, the end result of all of these policies was a “risk shift” that placed greater burdens on individuals and families, while letting employers and governments off the hook:

Instead of guaranteed pensions, these policymakers argued, workers should have tax-favored retirement accounts. Instead of generous health coverage, they should have high-deductible health plans. Instead of subsidized child care or paid family leave, they should receive tax breaks to arrange for family needs on their own. Instead of pooling risks, in short, companies and government should offload them... Economic insecurity strikes at the very heart of the American Dream. It is a fixed American belief that people who work hard, make good choices, and do right by their families have a good shot at stable membership in the middle class. The rising tide of economic risk swamps these expectations, leaving individuals who have worked hard to reach their present heights facing anxiety about whether they can keep from falling. And anxiety is just what millions of middle-class Americans increasingly feel.

FEAR, LOATHING and insecurity dominated both parties’ campaigns for the midterm elections.

In pledging to uphold Obamacare’s safeguards against insurance company discrimination against people with pre-existing medical conditions, the Democrats related to one aspect of the economic insecurity that stalks millions. For the Republicans, the chief issue was immigration — which was nothing but fear and loathing playing to the most retrograde sentiments of conservative America.

Following on the predictable explosion in the federal deficit caused by their tax-cut giveaway to Corporate America last year, the Republicans have promised to look for cuts in Medicare and Social Security. If they succeed, the changes to these programs will leave more people in fear for their health and their future.

Having campaigned on health care, the Democrats should be planning bold plans to fix the broken system, right?

Instead, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is floating what even the mainstream liberal MoveOn.org called a “staggeringly bad idea”: requiring a congressional supermajority to raise taxes.

Framed as a “tax cut for the middle class,” the supermajority requirement would effectively give conservatives and Republicans a veto over whether the Congress could ever pass expansive social programs, from paid family leave to Medicare for All.

“Equating support for middle-class families with opposition to increasing their tax rates is a conservative project, which Democrats have no business advancing,” wrote New York Magazine’s Eric Levitz. “If the party wishes to establish structural barriers to policies that would hurt the middle class, why not require a three-fifths majority to cut Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security?”

Pelosi’s trial balloon may not go anywhere, but it does show what she meant on Election Night when she talked about welcoming a “bipartisan market place of ideas.” It’s been a bipartisan commitment to austerity and the long-term decline in working-class living standards that have stoked discontent with the status quo.

Demagogues like Trump seek to channel that discontent into racism and xenophobia, as Hacker cautions: “The Great Risk Shift has led many to direct their anger outward: to search for scapegoats, to envy those who are perceived as still having a good deal, to see the problem in zero-sum terms (one person’s gain is another’s loss).”

But if that discontent is channeled into collective struggle, as we saw in the “red state rebellion” of teachers earlier this year, people can break through their isolation, overcome their fears and win gains."

Jul 28 2022,"US economy contracts again, fueling recession fears",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/28/economy/us-economy-second-quarter-gdp/index.html,"CNN —

The US economy shrank again in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday.

Gross domestic product, a wide-ranging measure of economic activity, fell by 0.9% on an annualized basis from April through June. That decline marks a key symbolic threshold for the most commonly used — albeit unofficial — definition of a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth.

The hotly anticipated data release has taken on outsized significance as investors, policymakers and ordinary Americans seek some measure of clarity in the current muddled economic environment.

The negative dip shown in Thursday’s first read on second-quarter GDP activity – data that will be revised two more times – was driven mostly by a decline in inventory levels. Businesses in recent quarters have tried to replenish stockpiles drawn down during the pandemic – and in trying to adjust for supply chain upheaval, they’ve found themselves overstocked at a time when consumers have pulled back on some purchases. Investments made in inventory during the second quarter were therefore lower than they were in the first quarter.

“The general takeaway is the economy is slowing, and that’s what the [Federal Reserve] wants,” said Ryan Sweet, who leads real-time economics at Moody’s Analytics. “We’re not in a recession.”

Although Thursday’s initial estimate marked a sharp drop from the 6.7% expansion the economy underwent in the second quarter of 2021, the White House has been adamant that the world’s largest economy, despite being buffeted by decades-high inflation and a cascade of supply shocks, remains fundamentally sound.

The administration even took the unusual step of publishing an explainer of sorts, maintaining that two consecutive quarters of economic contraction does not, in and of itself, constitute a recession. The White House posted a blog entry last week saying that in addition to GDP, data pertaining to the labor market, corporate and personal spending, production and incomes all go into the official determination of a recession.

The nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of recessions, and it is unlikely to render a verdict any time soon. The group’s Business Cycle Dating Committee typically weighs a plethora of statistics over a period of months before making a determination.

“They have a much stricter definition: It’s a broad-based and persistent weakness in the economy,” Sweet said. “And this isn’t broad based. It’s really concentrated in inventories and in trade – trade was a big drag on first-quarter GDP.”

Additionally, the labor market is doing well, he said. Monthly job gains average more than 450,000 through the first six months of this year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, while those gains are moderating, as anticipated, the past few weeks have also seen jobless claims increase.

On Thursday, the latest weekly jobless claims data from the BLS showed that first-time claims for unemployment benefits were an estimated 256,000 for the week ending July 23. That total is 5,000 below the previous week’s level, which was revised upward by 10,000 claims to 261,000.

“Jobless claims have definitely moved higher from their cyclical lows,” Sweet said. “I think that’s more of a reflection of an economy shifting into a lower gear.”

Economists say the biggest reason it would be premature to call a recession based on Thursday’s numbers is that the data can and probably will change. Subsequent revisions to first-quarter GDP figures, for instance, changed from an initial drop of 1.4% to 1.6%, and Thursday’s numbers are just the first of three estimates.

Adjustments are the norm rather than the exception, since the Commerce Department repeatedly refines its calculations as new information becomes available. About a third of initial GDP releases rely on statistical extrapolations and assumptions in the absence of hard data, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

“These are typically single points in time, snapshots. It’s almost like looking at a balance sheet versus an income statement over a quarter,” said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at US Bank Wealth Management.

“New information can emerge,” he said, and when it does, those variables change the outcome.

Sometimes, the differences between estimates are significant. Revisions to GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008, for example, revealed that economic activity actually plunged by an annualized -8.4%, indicating a much deeper recession than the initial estimate of -3.8% suggested.

Right now, the biggest smudge on the lens preventing economists from getting a clear picture is a buildup of inventories and a corresponding imbalance in the country’s usual trade flows.

“What you’re starting to see and hear a lot about right now is what’s happening with inventories… Inventories are an issue, both in terms of the mix of inventory retailers are holding as well as the amount,” Freedman said.

A rush to load up on goods during the previous two quarters was a miscalculation for companies like big-box stores. Walmart and Target have both told investors they expect to cut prices in order to move products. But from a macroeconomic perspective, some experts think those missteps imply that the economy in the first quarter wasn’t as anemic as the drop in GDP might otherwise imply.

Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBIZ Investment Advisory Services, suggested that the 1.6% contraction in first-quarter GDP was artificially low because businesses started stockpiling inventory in the final quarter of last year. This pulled forward economic activity that otherwise would have taken place in the early months of this year, she said.

“The fourth quarter, to me, was bloated a little bit,” Rathbun said. “Everyone was just hoarding things.”

In addition, when companies import more and export less, that dynamic weighs on GDP, said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

“It’s the value of production within the physical borders of the United States, so therefore if you have, hypothetically, exports that are flat and higher imports, then your trade deficit is rising. In that sense, a rising trade deficit subtracts from GDP,” he said, particularly when combined with wild swings in prices.

“When you have highly fluctuating commodity prices, and especially in periods of high inflation in general, then it can be misleading and, in my opinion, paint an overly negative view of where the economy is,” Kirkegaard said. “We have to be careful with saying the GDP number is the absolutely valid metric for economic well-being in the country.”

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday reiterated the importance of considering various key economic measures as the central bank determines future rate moves. However, Powell said the first read of a GDP report should be taken “with a grain of salt.”"
Jul 29 2022,"If the Economy Is Shaky, Why Are Company Profits Still Strong?",New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/business/strong-profits-shaky-economy.html,"Consumers are gloomy, the economy is shrinking, the Federal Reserve wants it to keep slowing and economists now say the whole world could be sliding toward recession.

At the same time, a lot of strong numbers are still coming out of many large American companies, which have been releasing their quarterly earnings reports and discussing their outlooks with Wall Street.

“We had an outstanding quarter,” Stephen Squeri, the chief executive of American Express, said after the company reported record revenue. “As our second-quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of,” said Christopher Nassetta, chief executive of Hilton Worldwide, noting that revenue per room in most major regions of the world was now above 2019 levels.

The blustery corporate optimism may seem at odds with the Fed’s grim determination to hold back the economy to get inflation down. But the economy is both what the Fed does and how companies and consumers are behaving. And the full picture of this strange economic moment is perhaps better captured by considering both sides together, central bankers and C.E.O.s, no matter how divergent they seem."

They hope to broker agreements meant to dampen global oil prices, help emerging markets escape crushing debt and increase food supplies to poorer nations where the cost of grain, rice and other staples has spiked since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

But the administration’s efforts have hit strong opposition from the two countries that will dominate Mr. Biden’s attention at the summit, and that can arguably do the most right now to lift the world’s economic outlook: Russia and China.

In 1992, the infamous Democratic strategist and campaign adviser, James Carville, famously coined the phrase ""It’s the economy, stupid"" as part of a campaign effort to win voters to Bill Clinton.

It was a contentious presidential year. President George H. W. Bush was seeking re-election but given the prevailing recession and growing economic uncertainty, Carville identified the pain point that would ultimately deliver votes to secure the presidency for the Democrats.

I was 4 years old in 1992, so I don’t remember much from that year, yet that phrase, and more so the strategy behind the phrase, has been taught and discussed in the decades following its birth. As we enter the home stretch in what has shaped up to be another contentious election, the strategy and the sentiment from 30 years prior remains the same today.

The economy remains the top issue driving voters this election cycle. The New York Times released a survey that showed 26% of voters view the economy as the most important problem facing the country (the highest in percentage compared to any other issue), and broadly, 78% of voters, according to the Morning Consult, view the economy as a top issue when deciding who to vote for in November. On top of that, CBS News released a survey that found 65% of voters believe the economy is getting worse and 68% say the Biden administration could do more to combat inflation.

DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED NEVADA COULD BE SEEING RED IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS

In Nevada, a state with one of the most contentious Senate races this cycle, is being hit hard by inflation. As of August, the state saw a surge in inflation, hitting 15.4% (almost double than the national rate). Broken down and annualized, that’s roughly $9,975 per household, or over $800 a month for basic goods and services. On top of that, Nevada is seeing no relief at the gas pump. The statewide average for a gallon of gas is $5.20, compared to the national average of $3.87, making Nevada one of the highest gas price states in the union.

Colorado is seeing similar trends. The Consumer Price Index for all items less food and energy rose 7.7% over the last 12 months. Food prices have increased 11.8% and gas prices hover around $3.67 a gallon (compared to $2.17 two years ago). The state has seen housing prices skyrocket by 23.6% year-over-year, with a median home price around $600,000, which is 51% higher than the national average.

The incumbent Senate Democrats in both states face a big hurdle this November. Nevada’s Catherine Cortez-Masto and Colorado’s Michael Bennet, both Democrats and loyal Biden allies in the Senate, have contributed to the economic disaster we all are facing. In 2021, they passed the second-largest spending bill in American history - the American Rescue Plan - at a tune of $1.9 trillion. In August of this year, they voted for an additional $750 billion in government spending through the Inflation Reduction Act. With these two examples, Cortez-Masto and Bennet have authorized the U.S. government to spend over $2.65 trillion in a matter of 16 months. Not to mention the additional spending bills they’ve passed within the same time frame or during their tenure in Washington.

Legendary economist Milton Friedman once said ""inflation is an old, old disease. We’ve had thousands of years of experience of it."" And ""the only cure for inflation is to reduce the rate at which spending is growing."" The cause of inflation, as Friedman would argue, ""is made in Washington and nowhere else,"" and I couldn’t agree more.

Since taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden has enacted policies through a series of legislation and executive action that have increased our nation’s spending by $4.8 trillion. While some would like to argue that this is a Democrat problem, it isn’t. Government spending transcends political party. For example, Donald Trump spent $6.7 trillion ($4.2 trillion of which to combat the effects of COVID-19) during his four years.

Therefore, acknowledging the root cause of inflation and working to rein in our government’s spending habits is where the answer lies. This election is important, not only for you and me, but for future Americans. Are we willing to jeopardize America’s future solely for cheap political wins? Or is it more American to identify the disaster we are in and fight to fix it?

Government spending is a problem and we are witnessing its results. We cannot spend our way out of inflation nor can we afford to promote policies that increase the rate in which we spend. So, while in this election cycle we’ve heard from candidates on a range of issues, I’d remind you that when push comes to shove, ""It’s the economy, stupid."""

Jul 26 2022,"The 1970s and now: Inflation, an unbalanced economy, and tough choices",Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2022/0725/The-1970s-and-now-Inflation-an-unbalanced-economy-and-tough-choices,"When it comes to monetary policy, however, the Federal Reserve has two advantages over its 1970s counterparts. First, it has learned from the 1970s playbook and understands more about how inflation works. Second, the Fed has more credibility today, amid an anti-inflation campaign that’s expected to include another big boost in interest rates this week.

“We seem to be in a world where there is less geopolitical stability, where you’re more prone to having sustained shocks to commodities,” says Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays investment bank in New York.

Very often, imbalances in the economy resolve themselves in ways that appear almost seamless. Other times, like the current inflation spike, balance is hard to find. One silver lining: A Fed that knows lessons from the 1970s.

Today the economy is in flux due to everything from the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions, the pandemic, and environmental stresses like drought. Curbing inflation now by boosting the supply of goods is easier said than done.

When will surging inflation go back down to normal? The answer is hard because the economy looks and acts a lot like a playground seesaw. Although it’s constantly in search of balance, occasionally a bully jumps on one end, tipping it toward recession or high inflation. In most periods, there’s plenty of time to counteract each bully. Sometimes, though, there’s a run of them, one right after the other, making balance almost impossible. That’s what happened in the 1970s, and that’s what is happening today.

From the grocery store to the electronics retailer to the car dealership, Americans ask the same question: When will inflation go back down to normal?

The answer is hard, frustratingly so, because the economy looks and acts a lot like a playground seesaw. Although it’s constantly in search of balance, occasionally a bully jumps on one end, tipping it toward recession or high inflation. In most periods, there’s plenty of time to counteract each bully. Sometimes, though, there’s a run of them, one right after the other, making balance almost impossible. That’s what happened in the 1970s and that’s what is happening today.

Today the economy, more globalized than it was back then, is in flux due to everything from geopolitical tensions and the pandemic to environmental stresses like drought. Curbing inflation now by boosting the supply of goods is easier said than done.

Why We Wrote This Very often, imbalances in the economy resolve themselves in ways that appear almost seamless. Other times, like the current inflation spike, balance is hard to find. One silver lining: A Fed that knows lessons from the 1970s.

“We seem to be in a world where there is less geopolitical stability, where you’re more prone to having sustained shocks to commodities,” says Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays investment bank in New York. “And that’s just a world that is very challenging for the Federal Reserve.”

On Wednesday, the central bank is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point – a hefty hike and the second such increase in a row. By raising lending rates to make economic activity more expensive, the Fed intends to slow the economy enough to beat inflation but not enough to send it crashing into recession. That’s a difficult tightrope act, especially when some economists believe the United States is in a recession already.

It’s just the latest high-wire jump. Already in the 2020s, the central bank – think of the Fed as a playground monitor – has had to negotiate a pandemic and lockdowns around the world, a short but sharp recession, record amounts of government stimulus, and an invasion of Ukraine and subsequent boycotts of Russian energy. These shocks have led to shortages, supply-chain bottlenecks, and boycotts that have tested the resilience of producers and consumers worldwide. “If anything, we have done better than we expected in the last couple of years,” says Diego Comin, an economics professor at Dartmouth College.

Up to now, consumers could take some solace in the idea that, as bad as inflation is now, the 1970s was worse. But the more researchers crunch the numbers, the more this period is looking like the 1970s. And that’s not good news for long-suffering families.

When Americans complain about the inflationary ’70s, what they’re really talking about is the period from 1973 to 1980, when inflation peaked early on after the first Arab oil embargo, fell somewhat, then spiked even higher after the second oil embargo. In 1980, for five months in a row, year-over-year inflation stayed above 14%. (By comparison, inflation last month hit 9.1%.)

Then the Fed did something extraordinary. It drove interest rates so high that inflation fell 11 percentage points over three years – a signal achievement, even if it took a deep recession to accomplish it. But there’s a caveat. The government measured inflation, specifically housing inflation, differently than it does now.

Measured the new way, that 11-point decline looks more like a 5-point fall – or about the same decline needed today to get inflation back to some semblance of normality, according to a new study for the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

Andrew Harnik/AP View caption Hide caption A monitor displays a graph showing average retail gas prices falling since June as Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein speaks at a press briefing at the White House in Washington, July 18, 2022.

There’s another measurement problem: core inflation. The government reports overall inflation and then strips out volatile food and energy prices to describe the more stable, long-term rise in prices: core inflation. That worked well in the 1970s, but in the past two years the relationship between core and overall inflation has broken down, according to Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Alternative measures of the core work better and, while they were relatively quiescent six months ago, they’ve climbed steadily, suggesting that high inflation is spreading far more broadly in the economy than just a few sectors.

How long all this will last is anybody’s guess. Dr. Millar of Barclays is optimistic. Barring another economic shock, so many sectors are decelerating that we are already at or near peak inflation, he says. Gas prices, for example, have been falling for a month.

Others are not so optimistic.

“It’s too soon, too optimistic to say we’ve peaked,” says Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Financial, a wealth management and investment banking firm. “The Fed at this point is focused on inflation, but that’s not going to alleviate anything from the supply side.”

The central bank is doing its best to tamp down demand for goods and services in order to bring the economy back into balance, but it has no control over supply. And the global economy, which in recent decades did adjust supply relatively quickly, is moving more sluggishly now. Geopolitics and pandemic shutdowns are drowning out the purely economic signals.

That measurement change in housing – using rent instead of mortgage rates to determine costs – also suggests that high inflation could last a while. “Housing makes up 40% of the core CPI measure, and we think that that measure is only going to keep rising for the next 12 months,” says Judd Cramer, author of the NBER study, a lecturer at Harvard, and former staff economist for the White House Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. “So it could be the case that the core CPI has not yet peaked.”

Consumers are not helpless in all this. They’re showing signs of coping with high prices just as their counterparts in the 1970s did: Buying cheaper goods and cutting out purchases they don’t absolutely need. Since March, for example, traffic to full-service restaurants has fallen while fast-food visits are increasing. Discount stores report fewer discretionary purchases and more one-stop shopping because gasoline is so high.

That said, the Fed has two big advantages over its counterparts in the 1970s. First, they’ve learned from the 1970s playbook and understand far more about how inflation works. Second, the Fed has far more credibility today. In the 1970s, the central bank acted in such a wishy-washy fashion that consumers and businesses alike expected high inflation to stay. Today, they expect inflation to fall back to normal levels.

“That is something that’s very good for the Fed: They don’t have to break the expectations” on Wednesday, says Dr. Cramer. Instead, they just have to carry out what markets expect them to.

“The U.S. economy is in a better position to deal with these shocks than we were in the ’70s,” Dr. Cramer adds."
May 04 2023,"Studios Push Back on WGA’s ‘Gig Economy’ Claims, Reject TV ‘Hiring Quota’",Variety,left,https://variety.com/2023/biz/news/writers-strike-studio-response-gig-economy-1235603628,"The organization that represents major Hollywood studios issued its first detailed response on Thursday to a series of issues raised by the Writers Guild of America in its three-day-old strike.

In a four-page document, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers pushed back on the guild’s claim that the studios are seeking to force writers into a “gig economy.” The AMPTP argued that writers enjoy fringe benefits and guaranteed employment terms that have “almost nothing in common” with standard gig jobs.

The AMPTP also rejected the need for a “hiring quota” for TV writers, saying it is “incompatible with the creative nature of our industry.” The guild is proposing a staffing mandate that, for most shows, would require a writers room of at least six to 12 writers.

“We don’t agree with applying a one-size-fits-all solution to shows that are unique and different in their approach to creative staffing,” the AMPTP stated. “Some writers are the sole voice of a show and others work with only a small team. The WGA’s proposals would preclude that.”

The AMPTP previously indicated that the TV staff minimum is a “primary sticking point” in the talks. The WGA has said that its staffing proposal is only meant to be an opening offer, but that the studios refused to engage at all on the subject.

The studio group also responded to the guild’s claims on artificial intelligence, which has become a major issue on the picket lines. At a rally on Wednesday night, WGA negotiations committee co-chair Chris Keyser warned that eventually almost all shows could be written by one writer and a computer.

Keyser has also said that the AMPTP refused to rule out using AI in the future, and agreed only to meet annually on the subject as technology develops.

In the document, the AMPTP stated that AI “raises hard, important creative and legal questions for everyone.”

“For example, writers want to be able to use this technology as part of their creative process, without changing how credits are determined, which is complicated given AI material can’t be copyrighted,” the AMPTP stated. “So it’s something that requires a lot more discussion, which we’ve committed to doing.”

The AMPTP also noted that the current WGA contract already includes a definition of “writer” that excludes an “impersonal purveyor” of literary material, “meaning that only a ‘person’ can be considered a writer and enjoy the terms and conditions of the Basic Agreement.” The AMPTP also argued that under the current contract, AI cannot claim a writing credit.

The guild is seeking to protect writers’ compensation and credits from encroachment by AI, and it has said that the studios’ assurances are insufficient to ensure that they won’t seek to replace writers with AI.

The AMPTP also argued that it has made an offer that includes the “highest first-year increase offered to the WGA in more than 25 years.” The studios are offering 4% increases in minimum rates in the first year, followed by raises of 3% and 2%. The WGA has said that it is seeking 6%, 5% and 5%. The studios are also offering a 7% raise in minimums for writer-producers, which would create a new tier for mid-level writers and give them a total first-year increase of 11%.

The guild is seeking a 25% hike in writer-producer minimums, for a total of 31% in the first year of the contract.

WGA negotiators have said that the raises in minimum rates are insufficient without minimum standards on staff size and the number of weeks of employment.

“They’re paying us the lowest possible rate for the fewest possible weeks,” Keyser said on the picket lines on Tuesday.

The guild has also focused on increasing streaming residuals. The AMPTP said that writers received a 46% increase in streaming residuals in their last contract, which began to kick in only last year.

The studio group argued that the guild is now seeking another 200% increase in foreign streaming residuals, and that the guild proposal “treats foreign subscribers the same as domestic subscribers.”

“However, subscription fees vary from country to country, and in many countries, the subscription fee is substantially less than it is in the U.S.,” the AMPTP said. “Nevertheless, the companies have recognized the importance of foreign streaming and have offered to increase the residual.”

Talks broke down on Monday night, after the AMPTP refused to make further moves on the WGA’s “key proposals.” The strike began on Tuesday morning.

Cracker Barrel announced the closures of three locations, including the final two in the Portland area, Monday and notified employees that the closures would be effective immediately, according to a report.

The pandemic’s crippling impact on business and the economy made the locations’ survival untenable, Cracker Barrel said.

“As a standard course of business, we continually evaluate the performance of our stores, using various criteria to ensure we are meeting the needs of our guests and our business,” the Tennessee-based company said in a statement.

“With that, we are saddened that we have been unable to overcome the impact the pandemic had on our business and have made the difficult decision to close the Beaverton, Tualatin, and Bend locations. The decision to close a store is never one we take lightly, and our focus right now is in assisting our impacted employees during this transition.”

Workers at the now-closed locations were surprised by the decision.

Jan 26 2023,US GDP grew at 2.9% pace in fourth quarter as economy cools,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-gdp-grew-pace-fourth-quarter-us-economy-cools-slightly,"The U.S. economy ended 2022 on solid footing, but momentum seems to have cooled slightly as consumers confront the dual threat of stubbornly high inflation and rising interest rates.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew by 2.9% on an annualized basis in the three-month period from October through December, the Commerce Department said in its first reading of the data on Thursday. Refinitiv economists expected the report to show the economy had expanded by 2.6%.

It marked a decline from the 3.2% pace recorded in the third quarter.

BUSINESS TAXES RISING JUST AS US ECONOMY HEADS INTO CHOPPY WATERS

Consumer spending – which accounts for about two-thirds of GDP – remained solid in the fourth quarter: It rose 2.1% for the period, a slight drop from the previous pace of 2.3%. Increases in private inventory investments, a boost in federal government spending and a jump in non-residential fixed income also helped to boost the GDP numbers. However, high mortgage rates continued to drain demand from the real estate market, with investment in housing plunging 27% for a second straight quarter.

GDP grew 2.1% for the entirety of 2022 after increasing 5.9% in 2021.

'IMMINENT' EARNINGS RECESSION COULD TANK US STOCKS, MORGAN STANLEY WARNS

Despite the surprising show of resilience, there are growing signs the economy is beginning to slow. Job growth is moderating; the housing market – which is vulnerable to higher interest rates – entered a recession last year; and consumer spending has shown signs of cooling off. A separate report released last week showed that retail sales tumbled 1.1% in December as spending on big-ticket purchases like cars and furniture dried up.

Economists widely expect the economy to slide into a recession sometime this year as a result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hike campaign. Policymakers raised the benchmark borrowing rate seven times in 2022 to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. Officials signaled that further rate hikes are coming this year, despite signs that inflation has peaked.

Markets widely expect the Fed to approve a quarter-basis point increase at the conclusion of their two-day meeting next week and follow that up with another similarly sized hike in March for a peak rate of 5%.

Hiking interest rates tend to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank are among the major Wall Street firms forecasting a downturn next year, although they remain uncertain about its severity.

""The economy is not yet finished absorbing the body blow to the economy caused by the bulk of the supersized rate hikes that the Fed imposed during the second half of the year,"" said RSM chief economist Joe Brusuelas. ""Despite the resilient close to a difficult year in growth, we just do not see such a happy ending to a turbulent era of American economic growth."""
Jan 26 2023,"The US economy grew by 2.9% in the fourth quarter, more than expected",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/26/economy/us-gdp-fourth-quarter/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN —

The US economy expanded again during the fourth quarter, registering solid growth to end 2022 even as consumers and businesses battled historically high inflation and rising interest rates.

Gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic activity — increased at an annualized rate of 2.9% from October to December last year, according to Commerce Department data released Thursday. For 2022, GDP expanded 2.1%, the report showed.

“It seems that the zeitgeist is very negative these days on the economy, so I’m seeing people pick apart these numbers, and the numbers are good,” said Robert Frick, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “We shouldn’t expect them to be fantastic, because the economy is slowing down … but they were still very positive.”

Last quarter’s 2.9% expansion, while a step back from the 3.2% annualized growth seen in the third quarter, represents continued improvement on the first half of the year when GDP shrank.

Following 2021, which saw GDP growth of 5.9% — the highest since 1984 — last year kicked off with two back-to-back quarters of contraction. Those declines set off alarm bells, since two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth mark a rule-of-thumb, but unofficial, definition of a recession.

However, 2022 was a year of transition as the economy continued to recover from the pandemic. Imbalances in trade and inventories had an outsized effect on the GDP data in the earlier parts of the year.

But businesses have since readjusted to snarls in the supply chain, and consumers have shifted their spending away from furniture, bikes and other goods and toward services like travel and dining out.

The robust economic growth registered during the fourth quarter was mostly fueled by a “shockingly resilient consumer,” said John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult.

However, there are signs that’s starting to wane, he said.

Fourth-quarter consumer spending, which was primarily focused in services sectors, increased 2.1%, a tick down from the 2.3% gain in the third quarter, according to Thursday’s report.

“Consumers are increasingly struggling to navigate the ongoing effects from the spike in prices last year by drawing on credit and savings,” Leer said. “With consumer demand likely to continue its downward trajectory, business investment is also likely to slow in the coming quarters, increasing the probability of a recession this year.”

Last year, inflation ballooned to a 40-year high and remained stubbornly elevated, chipping away at consumers’ finances and their confidence. The Federal Reserve embarked on a heavy-handed effort to quickly ramp up interest rates to help tamp down demand and lower inflation. While monetary policy changes require some time to take effect, certain areas of the economy (notably housing) have already grown considerably weaker.

Thursday’s report showed residential fixed investment slumped 26.7% during the final three months of the year, slightly narrower than the third-quarter plunge of 27.1%. Business investment in equipment fell 3.7% during the final quarter of the year.

Inflation is still the bogeyman

Inflation, which is slowing, remains the wild card for 2023, Frick said.

“Inflation is the bogeyman here, and the smaller the bogeyman we have, the less pressure there is on all of the other things that are holding up the economy — consumer spending, business spending, government spending,” he told CNN.

Expect the first six months of the year to be very dynamic, he said.

“A lot of it is going to depend on which of these things fades the fastest: If it’s inflation, we’re in great shape; and if it’s consumer spending, we’re in not-so great shape,” he said. “But I think there are a lot more positives that we’re looking at now than we were in November.”

Economists were expecting fourth-quarter GDP to grow at an annualized adjusted rate of 2.6%, according to Refinitiv.

Thursday’s GDP figures are the first of three official estimates to be released by the Commerce Department for the fourth quarter. GDP data is often revised, sometimes years later."

New York CNN Business —

Friday’s jobs report came in strong: the US economy added 261,000 new jobs in October, blowing away analyst expectations of 200,000, even as unemployment ticked up to 3.7%.

But don’t let the jobs boom lull you into a false sense of employment security. Job cuts and pauses on hiring are beginning to flow across the tech sector, which boasts some of the most valuable companies in the world. That’s bad news for the economy as a whole.

What’s happening: Tech companies are announcing an alarming number of layoffs and hiring freezes.

▸ Amazon (AMZN) announced on Thursday that it is pressing pause on corporate hiring. “We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business to adjust as we think makes sense,” wrote Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon (AMZN) in a note to employees.

Late last month, Amazon forecast its revenue for the holiday quarter would be lighter than analysts had expected, causing its stock to fall sharply. Shares of Amazon are down more than 47% this year.

▸ Apple (AAPL) has reportedly instituted a hiring freeze of its own in all areas except research and development. In a statement, Apple (AAPL) said that it will continue to hire and is confident in its future, “but given the current economic environment we’re taking a very deliberate approach in some parts of the business.”

Like other tech companies, Apple is worried about slower growth during the holiday season, higher interest rates and waning consumer spending. Covid lockdowns in China are also hurting production of the iPhone 14. Apple stock is down about 25% so far this year.

▸ Meta is planning to begin large-scale layoffs this week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. The parent company of Facebook (FB), Instagram and WhatsApp could cut thousands of jobs from its workforce of 87,000, and an announcement could come as soon as Wednesday, according to the report.

▸ Lyft (LYFT) said last Thursday that it will lay off 13% of its employees, or nearly 700 people, as it rethinks staffing amid rising inflation and fears of a looming recession. “We know today will be hard,” Lyft (LYFT) founders Logan Green and John Zimmer wrote in an employee memo obtained by CNN. “We’re facing a probable recession sometime in the next year and rideshare insurance costs are going up.”

In a filing announcing the layoffs, Lyft said it would likely incur $27 to $32 million in restructuring charges. “We are not immune to the realities of inflation and a slowing economy,” Lyft’s founders wrote in the memo to staffers. Shares of the car-share company are down nearly 70% so far this year.

▸ Online payments giant Stripe will lay off about 14% of its staff, CEO Patrick Collison wrote in a memo to staff Thursday. “We were much too optimistic about the internet economy’s near-term growth in 2022 and 2023 and underestimated both the likelihood and impact of a broader slowdown,” Collison wrote in the note. Just last year, Stripe became the most valuable US startup, with a valuation of $95 billion.

Chime, a private fintech firm, also announced it will lay off 12% of its 1,300-person workforce.

▸ Twitter on Friday announced extreme layoffs, noting that offices would be locked and badge access suspended as new CEO Elon Musk cuts about half of its 7,500-person workforce.

The bottom line: Headline jobs numbers and third-quarter corporate earnings still reflect a strong economy overall. But other companies won’t be immune to the softening demand from consumers and businesses that tech companies have noted.

Advertiser flight hits Twitter

More bad news for Twitter (TWTR): Elon Musk said on Friday that the company has seen a “massive drop in revenue,” as a growing number of advertisers pause their spending on the platform following his controversial $44 billion acquisition of the company.

He attributed the decline to “activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation and we did everything we could to appease the activists.”

General Mills (GIS) and Volkswagen Group, which owns Audi, Porsche and Bentley, have confirmed to CNN that they’ve paused their paid activities on the platform in the wake of Musk’s takeover. Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Pfizer (PFE) have also reportedly joined that list.

On Friday, a group of watchdog organizations including the Anti-Defamation League, Free Press and GLAAD, increased their pressure on brands to rethink advertising on Twitter. The groups pointed to Friday’s mass layoffs of Twitter staff as a key factor, citing fears that Musk’s cuts will make it difficult to enforce Twitter’s election integrity policies along with other anti-hate speech policy.

The takeaway: This is a key moment for Musk, who spent much of his week in New York trying to keep advertisers on board with Twitter. It doesn’t help that the uncertainty around the platform comes at a bad time for ad revenue-dependent tech companies. Google and Meta both cited lower ad payouts as a massive challenge in their most recent earnings reports.

More potential supply chain woes

The threat of a US rail strike that could disrupt supply chains is still very real.

Two rail unions reached tentative deals with the railroads in September, ahead of a strike deadline, only to have their membership vote against ratifying them. Now, US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh says that without a deal he expects Congress will step in and impose contracts on the unhappy rank-and-file union members.

“My goal is to get those two unions back at the table with companies and get this thing done,” Walsh told CNN Friday. He said a negotiated agreement would be “the best thing we can do is avoid any type of rail strike or slowdown.”

If any rail unions were to go on strike, all the rail unions — which together represent about 110,000 members — would honor their picket lines and refuse to work.

That would spell bad news for supply chains. About 30% of US freight moves by rail. Prices of goods from gasoline to food and cars could soar if trains halt. In addition, factories could be forced to shut temporarily due to parts shortages. Goods that consumers want to buy during the holiday season could be missing from store shelves.

Walsh was involved in a 20-hour bargaining session that reached tentative labor deals just hours before a Sept. 16 strike deadline. He said barring new negotiated agreements, Congress would have to impose a contract on the unions, as a way to keep union members on the job.

If “for some reason [one of the unions] doesn’t get to an agreement with the companies then … Congress will have to take action to avert a strike in our country,” he said."
Jan 26 2023,Economy grew 2.1% in 2022 amid barrage of interest rate hikes,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-grew-2-1-in-2022-amid-barrage-of-interest-rate-hikes,"The economy grew 2.1% in 2022, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday, a year marked first by recession fears and then by the largest burst of inflation in decades, which prompted a frantic campaign by the Federal Reserve to ease price pressures through interest rate hikes.

The numbers, adjusted for inflation, were driven by GDP growth in the second half of the year after the first half saw a contraction that led many to say that the economy had fallen into recession on President Joe Biden‘s watch. GDP growth for the fourth quarter clocked in at a 2.9% annual rate, the bureau said.

Last year’s GDP growth follows 2021’s gangbuster 5.9% GDP growth, which was so unusually high because it marked a year of reopening from the pandemic.

EXISTING HOME SALES HAVE WORST DECEMBER SINCE THE HOUSING CRASH IN 2008

Some details of Thursday’s report, though, suggest that underlying growth in the quarter was not as strong as the headline number made it out to be. Business additions of inventories, which is not indicative of future growth, boosted the headline growth rate by a full 1.46 percentage points. Meanwhile, business investment slowed, as did household spending. Housing construction cratered at nearly a 27% annual rate as the Fed’s rate hikes take a massive toll on home buying and construction.

“Sure the economy returned to positive growth in the second half of 2022 after declining in the first half of 2022, but for how long can the growth continue if consumers don’t return to the malls and businesses delay ordering up more equipment,” wrote Christopher Rupkey, the chief economist of FWDBONDS.

Still, Friday’s report shows that economic growth held up in 2022 despite a range of headwinds. The decline in GDP in the first two quarters, a situation commonly used to define a recession, raised fears that the situation was deteriorating. Measures of consumer sentiment declined earlier in the year, adding to the sense that a broad downturn was in store.

But the contractions in headline GDP might have masked underlying strength. The labor market has remained resilient, even in the later months of 2022. The economy notched 223,000 jobs in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported this month — a strong performance that shows commerce is holding up despite several headwinds. The last time unemployment was this low was right before the pandemic took hold back in 2020.

Still, the most notable economic trend of 2022 was the rise of inflation, which lowered the standards of living for many households. Bringing inflation down to normal levels may still involve recession. Inflation stood at 6.5% for the year ending in December, according to the consumer price index, far above the Fed’s target, which is roughly 2%.

Some economists fear that 2023 will not prove to be as bright as the Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation through rate hikes filter through the broader economy and start causing GDP decline and job loss.

Most economists predict that there will end up being at least a mild recession this coming year.

Last week, the World Economic Forum, which held its annual meeting in Switzerland, announced that nearly two-thirds of chief economists surveyed now expect a recession in the coming year. Additionally, the share of economists saying a recession is “extremely likely” has more than doubled since September.

Business and academic economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal assign a 61% probability of the economy falling into a recession over the next 12 months, according to data released last week. That is little changed from the 63% who said the same back in October."

Groceries, gasoline, rent and outstanding debts, inflation and painful price hikes have many Americans concerned about their financial present and future. And with fears that a recession could be lurking in the not-too-distant future, it's important that people get their affairs in order.

NPR reached out to financial experts on how to better navigate these turbulent times. Here's the advice they gave from their respective fields.

Income and personal finance do's and don'ts

On top of her role as an assistant marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School — one of the world's leading business programs – Wendy De La Rosa works to to improve the financial lives of those with low-to-moderate incomes. She co-founded the Common Cents Lab, which combines behavioral science and economics to improve people's financial well-being.

According to De La Rosa, people cannot budget or save if they aren't making enough, and that gets harder with everyday items going up in price. To get ahead, she recommends individuals take steps to bring in more money, starting with asking for a raise.

""With costs of living rising, I think it's an appropriate conversation to have,"" De La Rosa said.

At the same time, the best way to achieve a meaningful boost in income is to land a position with the competition, De La Rosa said.

""In this tight labor market, where employers are essentially falling over themselves to try to find talent, if you feel like you're being undervalued at your workplace, now is probably the time to start searching for another role,"" she said. ""Now is the time to polish off your resume, to get out there, see what you can get. And at the very least, ask for a raise at your company.""

The next problem to tackle is credit card debt.

As federal rates rise, so does the interest on your credit cards, which has hovered around 15% in recent years, according to Nerd Wallet. But rates can be as high as 25% to 30%.

An individual's rate is more often than not established when they're younger, when they have little to no credit, resulting in a higher rate, De La Rosa said. And though an individual's credit score improves over time with punctual payments, most credit card companies don't change their interest rate — unless you ask.

De La Rosa said tip No. 1 is, ""Go ahead, pick up the phone, call your credit card company and ask them to lower your interest rate. ... Many, many years ago, I did a small pilot where I brought people into the lab and had them sort of call your credit card company. And about 40% of them had success either getting a promotional 0% [annual percentage rate] or just getting a credit card interest rate decrease.""

An important detail worth noting, which many people may be unaware of, De La Rosa said, is that most credit card companies collect interest on overdue payments daily, not monthly. This is why it is imperative to get that balance back to zero as quickly as possible.

If you've got a mountain of credit card debt, don't wait until the end of the month to make one large payment. Instead, try to make payments weekly, or as frequently as possible, to avoid paying any more than absolutely necessary.

Having said that, De La Rosa isn't advising individuals throw every dollar they have at their debts. People should have some sort of cash savings available for emergencies.

""If you're near the middle-income threshold, where the average family earns about $60,000 a year, you might want to think about two to three months of emergency savings,"" she said. ""But all of that is dependent on where you are on the income spectrum and how much room you have.""

Advice for renters and prospective homebuyers

Jessica Lautz is the vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at the National Association of Realtors, America's largest trade association made up of experts in residential and commercial real estate markets. Lautz said that after approximately two years of real estate market mayhem, things are finally cooling down to a pre-pandemic pace.

At the same time, the median sales price in the nation is at an all-time high, at more than $400,000, a 14.8% increase from last year, according to NAR. Those prices can be attributed to the simple law of supply and demand: There have been far more prospective home buyers than homes for sale.

With the Federal Reserve recently hiking interest to a 40-year high, mortgage rates are also on the rise, with a 30-year mortgage averaging 5.89% as of last Thursday, according to Bankrate.com. Lautz said this could be an opportunity for homebuyers who missed out on home after home, as rising prices narrow the pool of potential buyers.

""They're facing slightly less competition that they had in the last year. ... We were seeing a median of five offers for every home. That has gone down slightly, but that doesn't mean that there's not competition today,"" Lautz said. ""We know that for buyers who are actively in the market today, they have to have a higher household income then other buyers in the past because interest rates have gone up, but home prices are still increasing at the same time.""

Getting into your first home is more difficult than upgrading later in life because of the down payment requirement, Lautz said — which is why it's important to start by finding a mortgage broker and real estate agent who know your area. These professionals can help establish a budget as well as clear up common misconceptions about the homebuying process.

""Some of the old-fashioned rules, like you need 20% down to enter homeownership, just may not be true depending on the loan product that you choose,"" Lautz said. ""The typical first-time homebuyer just put 6 to 7% down, for the last several years.""

That's still a lot of money. For most people, a home is going to be the single-largest purchase of their life. And first-time buyers often struggle to come up with the tens of thousands of dollars to cover the down payment and closing costs. However, today's rental market is expensive as well.

""We have seen many rental units are going for 30% more than they had just last year in some areas of the country,"" Lautz said. ""So, if you're in that situation and you have the ability to pull together a down payment and closing costs, it might make much more financial sense to actually purchase a home, especially if you plan to stay put.""

Many young buyers today are getting into homes by thinking unconventionally, Lautz said, like living with family for a period of time to save up for a down payment or renting a room out in their new home to subsidize costs. Some buyers are even going in on properties with friends and splitting the mortgage and bills.

For those who have been looking high and low for a home to no avail, or were outbid time and again, perhaps it's time to make some compromises. Consider looking in a different part of town that may be up and coming or sacrificing some of your wants and needs so you can secure a purchase, Lautz said.

In a few years' time, after the market returns to a sense of normalcy and buyers have equity built up from mortgage payments, they can return to the hunt for their dream home, moving up the property owner ladder.

""When you do purchase a home, you're paying towards your mortgage, but at the exact same time, [your] home should be appreciating ... So, you know that when you do go to place your home on the market it likely will be for a higher price than what you did pay for it,"" Lautz said. ""So, you'll be able to pay off what's left of your mortgage and then actually get money back for your next down payment as a move-up buyer into your second property or third property and so on.""

Things to consider about student loans

According to the Education Data Initiative, more than 43 million borrowers have had the luxury of having their federal student loan payments on pause since the COVID-19 pandemic began over two years ago. That pause is set to expire on Aug. 31, though it could theoretically be extended again.

President Biden is reportedly considering forgiving up to $10,000 of student debt per borrower. But with so much up in the air, Barry Coleman, vice president of counseling and education at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, said people should ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.""

""We won't know until it's announced whether or not that actually happens. ... It would amount to roughly $321 billion in federal student loan forgiveness, which is significant. And in that case, it would also completely eliminate federal student loan balances for approximately 11 to 12 million borrowers,"" Coleman said. ""That would be life changing for many consumers, if they didn't have to worry about that much debt.""

Instead of keeping their fingers crossed, Coleman recommends borrowers take advantage of the last few months of the pause to make payments on their principal, if they can afford it.

For those who don't have the means to make payments on the principal of their loan during the current interest-free grace period, he advises at least making with a plan. Since March 13, borrowers haven't had to account for their student loans in their budget. But with inflation driving up the price of everyday goods — on top of rent, credit card payments and more ­­-- running the numbers and coming up with a budget should be a priority.

""If and when these payments resume, understand where you are, where you will be after August 31, and just plan accordingly,"" Coleman said.

People can plan using the Department of Education's loan simulator. If they find that their loans may be too much of a financial burden, they can apply for an income-driven repayment plan to design a more manageable payment plan.

Additionally, it's important that borrowers double check that their contact information is up to date in case some form of forgiveness be issued. The Department of Education has to be able to reach you to discuss any updates about your debts.

He also noted that there are other paths to debt forgiveness. According to the Department of Education, the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program may forgive the remaining balance for qualifying applicants after they make approximately 10 years of payments. This includes government employees at the federal, state, local and tribal level, service in the U.S. military as well as non-profit work.

Full-time teachers who complete five academic years at a low-income school are also eligible for up to $17,500 in federal student loan forgiveness. And any U.S. servicemember who is receives a 100% disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs and is deemed totally and permanently disabled could have their federal loans discharged.

Individuals struggling to get financial affairs in order should reach out to the NFCC, Coleman said. As a non-profit organization, most of the NFCC's services are offered free of charge. They work with individuals to develop a plan to help them achieve their financial goals.

""I think it would be time well spent if a borrower participated in a counseling session just to sort of see where they are at and get some expert advice,"" Coleman said. ""We will provide that service regardless of whether someone can afford to pay or not.""

Honesty and the importance of putting yourself first

For many, addressing financial issues can be uncomfortable; it's not a happy endeavor, De La Rosa said. Which is why people put budgeting and other money talk near the bottom of their to-do list, all the while drowning in debt or struggling with spending control.

Calling credit card companies, going through subscriptions, creating a budget or evaluating spending habits are all relatively minor tasks, but nonetheless require time.

This is why De La Rosa suggests individuals take a ""financial health day."" Either a day or a block of time dedicated to siting down and addressing finances.

""We all have subscriptions that we know we should cancel. We all know that we should probably finally enroll in our company's 401(k) . ... But we are just lacking the time, Right? We don't prioritize ourselves because we're busy prioritizing everybody else around us, and we are just too tired at the end of the day,"" De La Rosa said. ""Love yourself enough to prioritize yourself right now. And whether that means asking for a raise, searching for another job, putting time in your calendar to do all the financial things that we've talked about, these are things that you've been putting off.""

For couples and families, it's important to be an open book. Pretending money monsters don't exist won't make them go away. Financial issues are one of the leading causes of divorce, De La Rosa said, which is why it's important that partners and family are on the same page when it comes to money ups and downs.

When people feel financially insecure, De La Rosa said, ""Basically half of your brain is thinking about your financial constraints and is unable to really focus on other kinds of problems.""

It is mentally exhausting. Which is why it's important to achieve a sense of balance.

Money does — to some extent — buy happiness, De La Rosa explained. So, if you find yourself grinding day in and day out, it is OK to spend a little to help pick yourself after a long week.

""One of the things that we know is that people get more pleasure and happiness out of buying experiences than material goods. So, if you have to choose ... choose to have the experience,"" De La Rosa said.

It can be as simple as going to the movies with friends or loved ones, for example. And if that's a little outside the budget, get creative. Some places offer free movie screenings in parks, and you can treat yourself to snacks. What you can or cannot do when money is tight is only limited by your imagination.

""You can turn almost anything into meaningful experience. And that's what I would just hope that people can do during this time, right? It is so taxing to have to think about your financial situation all of the time."""
Oct 27 2022,"US economy returned to growth last quarter, expanding 2.6%",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-europe-business-economy-gross-domestic-product-e1a95c0c9e7b046ed88ad2e9e3150dce,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. economy grew at a 2.6% annual rate from July through September, snapping two straight quarters of contraction and overcoming high inflation and interest rates just as voting begins in midterm elections in which the economy’s health has emerged as a paramount issue.

Thursday’s better-than-expected estimate from the Commerce Department showed that the nation’s gross domestic product — the broadest gauge of economic output — grew in the third quarter after having shrunk in the first half of 2022. Stronger exports and consumer spending, backed by a healthy job market, helped restore growth to the world’s biggest economy at a time when worries about a possible recession are rising.

Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic activity, expanded at a 1.4% annual pace in the July-September quarter, down from a 2% rate from April through June. Last quarter’s growth got a major boost from exports, which shot up at an annual pace of 14.4%. Government spending also helped: It rose at a 2.4% annual pace, the first such increase since early last year, with sharply higher defense spending leading the way.

Housing investment, though, plunged at a 26% annual pace, hammered by surging mortgage rates as the Federal Reserve aggressively raises borrowing costs to combat chronic inflation. It was the sixth straight quarterly drop in residential investment.

Overall, the outlook for the overall economy has darkened. The Fed has raised interest rates five times this year and is set to do so again next week and in December. Chair Jerome Powell has warned that the Fed’s hikes will bring “pain” in the form of higher unemployment and possibly a recession.

“Looking ahead, risks are to the downside, to consumption in particular, as households continue to face challenges from high prices and likely slower job growth going forward,’’ Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note.

With inflation still near a 40-year high, steady price spikes have been pressuring households across the country. At the same time, rising loan rates have derailed the housing market and are likely to inflict broader damage over time. The outlook for the world economy, too, grows bleaker the longer that Russia’s war against Ukraine drags on.

The latest GDP report comes as Americans, worried about inflation and the risk of a recession, have begun to vote in elections that will determine whether President Joe Biden’s Democratic Party retains control of Congress. Inflation has become a signature issue for Republican attacks on the Democrats’ stewardship of the economy.

Economists noted that the third-quarter gain in GDP can be traced entirely to the surge in exports, which added 2.7 percentage points to the economy’s expansion. Export growth will be difficult to sustain as the global economy weakens and a strong U.S. dollar makes American products pricier in foreign markets.

Thursday’s report offered some encouraging news on inflation. A price index in the GDP data rose at a 4.1% annual rate from July through September, down from 9% in the April-June period — less than economists had expected and the smallest increase since the final three months of 2020. That figure could raise hopes that the Fed might decide it can soon slow its rate hikes.

Last quarter’s U.S. economic growth reversed annual declines of 1.6% from January through March and 0.6% from April through June. Consecutive quarters of declining economic output are one informal definition of a recession. But most economists have said they believe the economy skirted a recession, noting the still-resilient job market and steady spending by consumers. Most of them have expressed concern, though, that a recession is likely next year as the Fed steadily tightens credit.

Preston Caldwell, head of U.S. economics for the financial services firm Morningstar, noted that the economy’s contraction in the first half of the year was caused largely by factors that don’t reflect its underlying health and so “very likely did not constitute a genuine economic slowdown.” He pointed, for example, to a drop in business inventories, a cyclical event that tends to reverse itself over time.

Higher borrowing costs have weakened the home market, in particular. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, just 3.14% a year ago, topped 7% this week for the first time since 2002, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday. Sales of existing homes have fallen for eight straight months. Construction of new homes is down nearly 8% from a year ago.

Still, the economy retains pockets of strength. One is the vitally important job market. Employers have added an average of 420,000 jobs a month this year, putting 2022 on track to be the second-best year for job creation (behind 2021) in Labor Department records going back to 1940. The unemployment rate was 3.5% last month, matching a half-century low.

Hiring has been decelerating, though. In September, the economy added 263,000 jobs — solid but the lowest total since April 2021.

International events are causing further concerns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted trade and raised prices of energy and food, creating a crisis for poor countries. The International Monetary Fund, citing the war, this month downgraded its outlook for the world economy in 2023.

While the U.S. economy expanded, the European Central Bank predicted weakening growth in the 19 countries that use the euro currency the rest of this year and next, pointing to the uncertainty of Russia’s war in Ukraine that could keep food and energy prices high. While ECB President Christine Lagarde said the likelihood of recession had increased, the central bank on Thursday still announced its second big interest rate hike in a row to target inflation running at 9.9%."

At the sold-out event held at the Ent Center for the Arts and hosted by Pike Peaks United Way’s Public Policy Council, the two candidates answered questions on issues including law enforcement, growth, economy and education.

With three weeks until Election Day, the debate offered voters a view into each candidate’s comprehensive vision for the city and differing approaches after both previously listed the same top three campaign priorities: infrastructure, public safety and economic vitality.

“My vision for this city is that we become an inclusive, culturally rich, economically prosperous, safe and vibrant city on a hill for the world to see,” Mobolade said. “This is a long-range vision that has actionable steps over the next four years and I’ve been taking a look at each one of these areas and we’ll be leaning into them, forming a community coalition around each of these areas.”

“This is the city that I fell in love with and my vision for the future is that this continues to be the place that everyone who comes here, whether you’re a visitor or for a job interview, falls in love with our community again,” Williams said. “It is absolutely critical that we address these needs that I have focused my campaign on.”

Williams touted his longtime political experience to show how he plans to approach issues including crime and public safety. He referenced his appointment to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training board by Gov. Jared Polis and said this experience in public safety leadership would permit him to appropriately address the needs of law enforcement and firefighters in the city.

Mobolade said his efforts in public safety would focus on attrition issues and bolstering retention, rather than recruitment, based on concerns that he said have been brought to his campaign by the Colorado Springs Police Protective Association. “The problem is to boost morale. This is a workforce issue,” Mobolade said.

Mobolade, a political newcomer, outlined a plan to address affordable housing in Colorado Springs, first appointing a chief housing officer to directly report to him. As mayor, Mobloade said he would initiate new development conversations to bring down housing costs and prioritize diversifying city transportation with continued city growth.

Mobolade has experience as an entrepreneur, business leader and nonprofit founder. He is Colorado Springs' former Small Business Development administrator and co-founded restaurants Good Neighbors Meeting House and The Wild Goose Meeting House, as well as business consultant company Niche Coaching and Consulting. Mobolade also served as a ministry leader at First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs, according to his website.

Williams shared that he moved to Colorado Springs after a job offer gave him the choice between Denver and Colorado Springs in 1992; he called the decision an easy one. Now, he says he does not want Denver to interfere with decisions on local land use, citing many areas that the city should focus on to handle growth under his mayorship.

Williams most recently served as a member of the Colorado Springs City Council, where he worked with county representatives to make sure a voter-approved tax, which was extended for another 10 years in November, will help pay for upgrades to Marksheffel Road and Powers Boulevard.

Featured Local Savings

Williams is also a former El Paso County commissioner, clerk and recorder and Colorado secretary of state. When he was a county commissioner, he established the Pikes Peak Regional Transportation Authority that collects a 1-cent regional sales tax that funds transportation projects. As clerk and recorder, he said he created an office on Fort Carson for people to get things like licensing and election services taken care of.

""I've had the opportunity to actually deliver and create opportunities in this community,"" he said.

Both candidates also recognized city government's role in addressing homelessness.

Williams said there he would have a two-fold approach, the first by enforcing related ordinances like illegal camping, the second to work with and support nonprofits that provide resources to people who are unhoused.

Mobolade cited mental health as the root cause for a large percentage of people who are unhoused and expressed intentions to support mental health initiatives, in addition to wraparound care and increased outreach professionals.

A question from a student attending the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where the Ent Center is located, asked what these two candidates would do as mayor to entice local college graduates to either remain in the city or return for their careers. Both expressed an interest in connecting young professionals with job openings in the city.

Both candidates have children and shared plans to support public education as mayor. Mobolade pushed public safety in schools, sharing that this is an especially important topic for him because his oldest child at 9 years old is the same age as the three third graders killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville school last month.

Williams echoed public safety support with school resource officers. He also expressed a desire to support parents doing what is best for their child’s education, citing his own experience putting his four children through public school in Colorado Springs.

""Parents know best for their children and we should support that,” Williams said.

In the runoff, the candidate who earns a majority of votes, or more than 50% of votes cast, will be named mayor.

“A lot of people chose not to vote in that first election,” Williams said after around 35% of registered voters cast ballots in the municipal election on April 4.

“Please vote. Please recognize that whether or not you voted in the first election, you have that opportunity and responsibility to vote in this one.”

Mar 06 2023,Larry Summers: US economy could hit an ‘air pocket’ in the coming months,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/06/economy/larry-summers-fed-wile-e-coyote/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN —

The US economy may still be running fast and strong, but its risk of suddenly falling into a recession still looms large, despite the Federal Reserve’s efforts, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned Monday.

Summers told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an interview that he expects the Fed will have to raise its benchmark interest rate higher than expected and that central bank’s “push and push” to combat inflation will soon trigger a downturn.

“The process of bringing down inflation will bring on a recession at some stage, as it almost always has in the past,” Summers said.

And for the US economy, it could likely mean a “Wile E. Coyote moment,” Summers said, referencing the cartoon canine’s relentless — yet futile — pursuit of the speedy Roadrunner off a cliff and into mid-air.

Gravity eventually could win out.

“The economy could hit an air pocket in a few months,” he said.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers tells CNN's Poppy Harlow in a March 6, 2023, interview that the economy could face a ""Wile E. Coyote"" moment in the coming months. CNN

For the past year, the Fed has enacted a series of interest rate hikes aimed at chilling demand and cooling down historically high inflation. In recent months, as the pace of price increases has moderated, the central bank has eased off the gas pedal.

In February, the Fed’s policymaking committee approved a quarter-point interest rate hike — its smallest increase in several months.

But in the weeks following that meeting, there was a barrage of surprisingly strong economic data, showing blockbuster job gains, hearty consumer spending and unyielding inflation.

“I don’t think there’s any question that we do not yet have inflation on a secure glide path anywhere near down to the 2% [Fed target] level,” Summers said. “And until the Fed can be confident of that, it’s going to have to be tightening rather than easing.”

Some Fed members agree.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has cautioned that bringing down inflation will take a “significant period of time,” while other Fed leaders have indicated they’re open to larger interest rate hikes.

As of Monday, markets are expecting the Fed to make another quarter-point raise: The CME FedWatch Tool is showing a 69.4% probability of such a hike; however, the perceived chances of a half-point increase (at 30.6%) have grown considerably during the past few weeks. One month ago, the probability for a half-point increase was 3.3%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

Summers said his best guess would be for the fed funds rate to grow from its current range (4.5% to 4.75%) to 5.5%, but noted he “wouldn’t be amazed” if it were to hit 6%, given the uncertainties in the economy.

“Hope for the best but plan for the worst, I think is the right advice,” Summers said."
Jun 12 2022,How the ‘Energy Shock’ Has Upended the Global Economy,Bloomberg,left,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-13/how-the-energy-shock-has-upended-the-global-economy-quicktake,"Just as the world was getting serious about a green-energy future, its dependence on fossil fuels struck home with a force not seen since the 1970s. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine combined with pressures unleashed by the pandemic to send the price of all forms of energy rocketing, with oil climbing more than 50% in the first half of 2022. That energy shock was at the heart of a surge in inflation that caused hardship and political headaches around the globe.

Just two years ago, the price of the benchmark US oil futures contract plunged briefly below zero as the pandemic sank the global economy. A year later, the price had rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and kept on rising as revived demand outstripped growth in crude supplies. Then came a wild series of jolts from the waves of sanctions by the US and its allies to shut out Russia, the source of 10% of the world’s oil (along with other key commodities from wheat to fertilizer to nickel). More than half of Russia’s oil exports go to the countries in the European Union, but markets for energy are global, so changes in supply and demand are felt worldwide."

Axios ran a story called “America’s hidden boom.” It argued that the U.S. economy is doing extraordinarily well.

The bottom line: Things haven’t been so good for so many in decades, Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research told The New York Times. “You’d have to go back to the late 1990s to find a similar era. Before that, the 1960s.”

Verdict: False.

The U.S. economy is doing terribly. Inflation is running at the worst level in 40 years.

Fifty-five percent of Americans think we’re in a recession, including a plurality of Democrats. Eighty-three percent of Americans say economic conditions are poor or not so good.

Real wages are plunging, which means that extremely tight labor market conditions are not helping American households. Unemployment is very low but it was just as low in the prepandemic Trump administration with much lower inflation.

Home affordability is nearing an all-time low. Gas prices keep setting new record highs.

This is not the best economy in decades."

Most of this is Beijing’s own doing. A draconian zero-COVID-19 policy has locked down swaths of the economy, severely hit consumer spending, and curtailed factory output. Aggressive regulation of the technology sector, driven by Chinese President Xi Jinping’s retreat from private enterprise and embrace of Maoist socialism, has paralyzed a once-dynamic industry.

For all these reasons, the International Monetary Fund recently lowered its forecast for China’s economic growth to 4.4 percent this year—anemic by past Chinese standards.

It is becoming increasingly clear that China’s economy is facing significant headwinds. Most of this is Beijing’s own doing.

Bloomberg Economics predicts as little as 2 percent and expects the United States to grow faster than China for the first time since 1976.

Couple these recent trends with longer-term headwinds such as slowing productivity growth, demographic decline, and a continued brain drain among technology workers and entrepreneurs, and it becomes clearer that China is not the economic juggernaut many in the West believe it to be. In the context of heightened geopolitical competition, that’s led to a lot of schadenfreude, cheer, and outright triumphalism in the West. Now, “the United States can shape the collapse of China just as it did the Soviet Union,” Robert Wilkie, secretary of veterans affairs during the Trump administration, argued late last year.

Nonetheless, hoping for an economic collapse in China would be very unwise.

First, recessions hurt a lot of average people. Although the Chinese Communist Party is becoming increasingly totalitarian at home and revisionist abroad, there are more than 1.3 billion Chinese who have no connection to the party. They will bear the brunt of China’s economic tumult, as will lower-income Americans and less well-off people around the world. All of them will be caught in the fallout when the world’s second-largest economy falters.

Since the beginning of Beijing’s economic liberalization in the late 1970s, it is estimated that about 800 million Chinese have been lifted out of grinding poverty. Despite Beijing’s troubling turn toward illiberalism, the mass reduction of poverty in China remains one of the world’s most important humanitarian success stories. A recession—whether from Xi and the party seizing control of the economy or other causes—will hurt average Chinese citizens. In an attempt to soften the blow, China is already planning to pump $5.3 trillion into its economy—about a third the size of its overall economy—through fiscal and monetary measures this year. These include increased lending to small businesses, cuts in taxes and administrative fees, and subsidized consumer purchases.

There’s nothing like a little jingoism and war to draw attention away from China’s domestic troubles.

In the United States, average Americans are at risk given the high degree of economic integration between the two countries. Americans continue to consume goods from China at a record pace, despite higher tariffs imposed as part of the U.S.-Chinese trade war. With U.S. inflation soaring and China continuing to be crucial in U.S. companies’ supply chains, the slowdown in Chinese manufacturing due to Beijing’s pandemic policies will put even more upward pressure on prices in the United States, hitting American consumers and companies that are already struggling to deal with the reemergence of inflation. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, and economists increasingly predict a U.S. recession within the next year or so—even without the additional blow of a Chinese implosion.

China is also a significant foreign market for U.S. goods and services, exceeded only by Canada and Mexico. A slowing Chinese economy means a decline in demand for U.S. products—including cars, electrical machinery, medical equipment, and fuel—hurting American businesses and workers reliant on exporting to China.

Finally, the Chinese Communist Party derives much of its legitimacy from continuing to grow the economy and raise the country’s standard of living. If a significant economic downturn thus threatens to weaken the party’s hold on power, one likely result would be an even more aggressive, nationalist foreign policy. There’s nothing like a little jingoism and war to draw attention away from domestic troubles. Yes, an economically weaker China would face tougher trade-offs between military spending and other objectives. But there is no guarantee Beijing wouldn’t double down on its aggressive foreign stance and tighten elsewhere instead.

With a major land war raging in Europe, the U.S. economy softening, and China’s ever more visible problems, the risk of a global recession is increasing. As Harvard University economist Kenneth Rogoff recently reminded us, “a collapse in one region will raise the odds of collapse in the others.”

To be clear, Beijing’s economic practices pose significant challenges that must be addressed—whether it’s unfair competition with market-oriented Western economies or China’s systematic undermining of the rules-based trading system. But the way to force China to play a more constructive role in the global economy is to deal with these issues head-on—not by hoping for its economy to collapse. A significant downturn in China could have grave and unforeseen consequences for the rest of the world—so be careful what you wish for."

If you think the economy is confusing right now, consider how baffling it must look to Home Depot and Walmart. Last week, the two big retailers sent cautious signals about the health of the U.S. consumer. In a nutshell: Walmart said U.S. consumer spending started the year strong, but that it expect households to back off through the year, producing weak fiscal-year 2024 U.S. sales growth of 2 to 2.5 percent. Home Depot said consumer spending is holding up, but that it expects a flat sales-growth year overall, with declining profits. Indeed, the latest inflation read from last Friday's core personal consumption expenditures index was hotter than expected, showing a consumer that continues to defy expectations. Friday's PCE showed consumer spending rose more than expected as prices increased, jumping 1.8% for the month compared to the estimate of 1.4%. From the big-box retail earnings to declining hopes that disinflation would be a straight line down in 2023, the latest news from the markets and economy highlight just how hard a job the Federal Reserve has in cooling the economy without causing a recession. ""The consumer is resilient right now,"" said CFRA Research retail analyst Arun Sundaram. ""The consumer is still spending, not as much as a year or two ago, but they haven't quite stopped."" Consumer, retail stocks post a very bad week The 2023 outlook from these two key consumer companies sent the Dow and S&P 500 down on Tuesday, and the market's recent losing streak continued through the end of the week. It wasn't a good week for the retail sector or consumer stocks, either. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF is up 9% for the year, but was down roughly 7% last week, its worst five-day stretch since July 2022. Consumer discretionary stocks turned in the worst performance of any S&P 500 sector, down close to 4.5% for the week.

""We also still see a healthy customer. We have good jobs, job growth, growing wages, still strong balance sheets,"" Home Depot CEO Ted Decker told analysts on itsrecent earnings call. ""We do see a unique environment with many cross currents right now. Obviously there's heightened inflation and rising interest rates, the tight labor market and moderating equity and housing markets. So given all of that, we do expect moderation in home improvement demand."" Home Depot was the second-worst performing stock in the Dow last week, down nearly 7% — the only Dow stock that did worse was Intel, which cut its dividend by 65%.

Among Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs' economists take the view that the consumer strength can continue, saying household income growth bottomed out in 2022 as Covid-related income support programs ended, and will rebound this year, bolstering companies, including Walmart in particular. Goldman economists expect disposable personal income to grow 6.1% this year, compared to a 0.4% decline in 2022, according to a recent report, driven by rising wages and higher profits for small business owners. That means consumers can spend more without dipping into savings and investment gains. ""The outlook for sustained consumer spending growth remains,"" wrote consumer analyst Jason English. ""Growth in [disposable income] and moderation in essential spending inflation mean that spending growth will no longer need to be funded from net savings, with [a] bounce back in the savings rate expected beginning in the first quarter of 2023."" Friday's PCE report showed that the personal savings rate was up, rising to 4.7%. Home prices, groceries, inflation At Morgan Stanley, retail analyst Simeon Gutman described what he saw as a notable difference in the outlook from the two big retailers after last week's earnings. His take: Home Depot's customer is richer than Walmart's, propped up especially by the home equity gains of recent years. But Home Depot's view may fail to account fully for coming declines in home prices, he suggested. ""WMT's more sobering consumer outlook is undoubtedly informed by the weakness it has seen in general merchandise and the overall mix shift to [groceries, which are less profitable],"" Gutman said. ""HD's more balanced view may underestimate the lagging impact of a rapid deceleration in housing metrics.""

There may be a simple way to square the conflicting signals on the consumer and the retail numbers, said Richard Moody, chief economist at Birmingham-based bank holding company Regions Financial . Walmart may be seeing an impact sooner from inflation, which will continue, albeit at a slower pace, into the second half of the year. ""The cumulative effects of high inflation will take a toll, and a slowing pace of growth in labor earnings will also weigh on spending,"" Moody said. ""Remember, even as inflation slows, prices are still rising, they're just rising at a slower rate, so lower inflation isn't going to unleash a bunch of cash for consumers to spend."" But Home Depot may benefit from a decline in interest rates in late 2023, producing a modest but steady rate of growth consistent with the bank's outlook for the single-family housing market, he said. Fed, interest-rate forecasting Predicting where rates end in 2023, though, is no easy task. This year started with the bond market confident the Fed was nearing the end of rate increases and increasing its odds that the Fed would cut before year end as inflation slowed and it started to look more likely the economy achieved a ""soft landing."" But after two straight hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reads in recent weeks from CPI and PCE, there is now talk of the Fed potentially raising 50 basis points at the next meeting, and the ""higher for longer"" view of where rates end of the year (over 5%) is suddenly back in the driver's seat among Fed watchers. The upshot, heading into earnings reports by retailers like Costco and Target next week, is that there's upside in stocks like Walmart if consumers prove to be healthier than either company's guidance implies, Gutman said. And the minutes of the Fed's January meeting threw out one idea markets haven't yet focused on: That states, which have doubled the size of their rainy day funds since 2018 partly by hanging on to some Covid-driven federal aid, could give consumers money by cutting taxes. ""[P]articipants noted that inflation was eroding households' purchasing power,"" the minutes reported. ""However, a couple of participants noted that some states could return part of their sizable budget surpluses to households through tax cuts or rebates, which would provide support to consumption."""
Sep 19 2023,Norfolk Southern to pay Ohio town residents for any lost home value after a train crash and resulting health worries decimated the local economy,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/09/18/norfolk-southern-pay-lost-home-value/,"Norfolk Southern announced new details Monday about its plan to compensate East Palestine residents for lost home values since the fiery derailment disrupted life in the eastern Ohio town in February.

The railroad’s program will no doubt be welcomed by some people who want to sell their homes and move away from the town rather than deal with the lingering health worries. But some critics say the railroad should be doing more to address those health concerns instead of worrying so much about economic recovery in the area.

And the details are still tentative because the Ohio Attorney General’s office is still negotiating an agreement that will create a long-term fund to compensate homeowners along with two other funds to pay for any health problems or water contamination issues that crop up down the road. The Attorney General’s office said it’s not clear when those funds will be finalized because of all the unanswered questions at this stage.

Already, the railroad estimates that the cleanup will cost more than $800 million, which includes $74 million that Norfolk Southern has pledged to East Palestine to help the town recover. That total will continue to grow as the cleanup continues, the funds are finalized and various lawsuits move forward. The railroad will also get compensation from its insurers and likely other companies involved in the derailment.

“This is another step in fulfilling our promise to East Palestine to make it right. Norfolk Southern is steadfast in keeping our commitments, including protecting the home values of the community,” said CEO Alan Shaw, who is working to improve safety on the railroad. “This program aims to give homeowners the reassurance they need.”

The new program will pay homeowners in East Palestine and the surrounding area about five miles around the derailment the difference between the appraised market value of their homes and the sale price. But accepting compensation through the program will require homeowners to forego property damage claims they might eventually collect as part of one of the lawsuits against the railroad.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, praised the railroad for following through on the commitment it made in the spring. “I intend to keep the pressure on Norfolk Southern to make things right for the community,” he said.

JD Vance, one of Ohio’s U.S. Senators who proposed a package of railroad safety reforms after the derailment that is still awaiting a vote, said he remains skeptical of Norfolk Southern.

“My expectations that they will deliver on their promises are low,” said Vance, a Republican. “I will continue to hold the railroad and its backers in Congress accountable for the promises they made to Ohioans.”

Longtime East Palestine resident Jami Wallace, who still hasn’t moved back home since the derailment, said she and the Unity Council group she helps lead are much more focused on residents’ health instead of things like home values, even though the government and railroad continue to insist that ongoing tests of the air and water in the area don’t show concerning levels of chemicals.

Plus, she said “a lot of our most vulnerable are the people that rent,” so this program to help homeowners won’t do much for them.

“Human health should just come first,” Wallace said.

And getting answers to the community’s questions about potential health problems is the priority for Wallace, who is frustrated that she has been unable to persuade the EPA to conduct detailed testing inside her home’s basement.

Besides, people who have lived in town for generations aren’t eager to sell their homes anyway. They just want to know if their homes are safe.

“It’s not just about selling the house and being able to move to another house. We don’t want to move,” Wallace said."
Sep 25 2022,Fed unsure of economy’s direction as Wall Street meltdown worsens,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/09/24/fed-inflation-recession-wall-street/,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell acknowledged this week that there are a few things he does not know about the U.S. economy. He doesn’t know if it is doomed to fall into recession. He doesn’t know how long high inflation will persist. And he doesn’t know if healthier supply chains will be much help.

“It’s very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold,” Powell told reporters this week. “No one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be.”

Public confessions of doubt are rare in official Washington. But they have become commonplace for Powell, 69, whose candor reflects the uncertainties shrouding the global economy as well as a revolution in Fed communications since the days when then-Chairman Alan Greenspan cultivated an image of singular economic mastery.

But Powell’s latest remarks come as the Fed’s anti-inflation fight is making only slow progress, leaving the institution and its boss vulnerable to criticism over the cost to workers and businesses of continued rate hikes.

On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell for the fourth straight day, sinking below 30,000 for the first time since June and wiping out everything investors had gained since November 2020.

“People look to the Fed as the best source on where we’re going. The Fed has information. They have a highly-trained staff. They have no political reason to hide the ball,” said Claudia Sahm, who spent 12 years as a Fed economist. “Everyone wants to know where we’ll be next year. … But really the Fed is just as blind as the rest of us.”

After wrongly predicting for most of last year that inflation would prove “transitory,” Powell has emphasized the complexities involved in righting the $25 trillion U.S. economy as it is buffeted by an unusual mix of forces.

Indeed, no one has seen an economy like the current one. Snarled supply chains. Soaring global food and fuel prices, triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Rolling factory shutdowns in China resulting from an unpredictable pandemic.

The cumulative impact has repeatedly surprised Fed prognosticators, Wall Street analysts, White House officials and corporate executives. Current inflation readings are “not where we expected or wanted to be,” Powell conceded this week.

Even with the additional, planned rate hikes, the Fed does not expect annual inflation to return to its 2-percent price-stability target before late 2025.

“You have to make your best guess with limited data and limited understanding,” said Marc Chandler, managing director for Bannockburn Global Forex. “The Fed recognizes, not only that it’s been so wrong, but that there’s no playbook. How do you play these multiple shocks?”

Profound uncertainty is not causing the Fed to go slow.

Powell’s comments to reporters on Wednesday came as he unveiled the central bank’s fifth interest rate increase this year, all designed to slow the economy and ease pressure on prices. Since March, the Fed has lifted its benchmark lending rate by a full 3 percentage points, the fastest increase of that size since 1982.

The Fed chief said rates probably will rise by an additional point-and-a-quarter before year end. Some economists think the central bank should pause to evaluate the impact of its earlier efforts to slow the economy before implementing further increases. But Powell’s bet is that the costs involved in losing control of inflation outweigh the dangers of pushing the economy into a recession.

To dispel some of the analytical fog, the Fed this week also released its top officials’ quarterly economic forecasts.

Wall Street analysts pore over the figures, which represent the most authoritative guide to the assumptions guiding monetary policy.

Yet, Powell suggested that there is a false precision to the projections, which are specified down to one-tenth of a percentage point through 2025.

“No one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now,” he said.

That’s a polite way of saying that the Fed’s best guesses are often wrong. At the beginning of this year, for example, the median projection for the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge called for prices to rise this year by 2.6 percent.

The latest estimate now calls for inflation this year to be 5.4 percent, more than twice the initial forecast.

“What Powell is doing is communicating that the evolution of the economy is ambiguous, and how they may need to respond is equally uncertain,” said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist for Citigroup. “We’ve moved into a period where many of the Fed’s models and equations have gone off track. They have less visibility for that reason into how the economy is going to evolve.”

The Fed began releasing these internal forecasts only in 2007 as part of an effort by then-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke to promote greater transparency in the central bank’s deliberations. In 2011, Bernanke also began holding a quarterly news conference to discuss the Fed’s thinking.

Under Greenspan, who served as Fed chair from 1987 to 2006, the central bank was mostly mute. There were no regularly scheduled news conferences, no public releases of officials’ projections, and Greenspan prided himself on a deliberately impenetrable public speaking style.

“If I turn out to be particularly clear, you've probably misunderstood what I said,” he told one audience.

Greenspan was fortunate to command the Fed after the high inflation of the 1970s had been extinguished. His tenure also coincided with a technology-infused productivity boom and the early financial gains associated with China’s entry into the global trading system, which helped keep inflation low for years.

As the U.S. economy flourished, and the stock market soared, Greenspan’s reputation rose as well.

“Greenspan benefited from being the Fed chair through a period when many of the shocks were favorable,” Sheets said. “When everything’s going right in the economy, it’s much easier for a policymaker to look brilliant.”

Powell has not had that luxury. A veteran corporate lawyer and investment banker, he was appointed to the post in 2018 by former president Donald Trump — who routinely berated him on Twitter — and reappointed for a second four-year term by President Biden earlier this year amid the worst inflation in four decades.

To fight annual consumer price inflation of 8.3 percent, the Fed plans to raise interest rates until the economy slows. Making credit more expensive already has sent the housing market into decline, and Powell has warned that conquering inflation will mean “pain.”

As economic weakness spreads, employers first will eliminate open positions and then begin laying off workers, economists said.

The Fed expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4.4 percent next year, from today’s 3.7 percent level. Many private forecasters are more downbeat. Economists at Bank of America on Friday said the jobless rate will peak at 5.6 percent in December 2023, implying a flood of pink slips that could cost more than 3 million Americans their jobs.

The central bank’s actions are already hurting investors. Since the Fed began raising interest rates in March, global stock markets have lost $12 trillion in value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Powell’s extensive efforts to explain to Americans what is happening with the economy have attracted some second-guessing. After the Fed chair’s latest news conference, Lawrence Summers, the former treasury secretary, questioned on Twitter “whether the Fed’s credibility is well served by frequent hour long dialogues on hypotheticals and the unforecastable.”

Chairman Powell is very thoughtful at press conferences but I wonder whether the Fed's credibility is well served by frequent hour long dialogues on hypotheticals and the unforecastable, with the backdrop of gyrating markets. — Lawrence H. Summers (@LHSummers) September 21, 2022

The Fed “should consider the idea of TMI,” shorthand for too much information, Summers added.

Despite the snark, financial markets still believe that the Fed will deliver on its promise to subdue rising prices. Investors anticipate inflation averaging 2.4 percent over the next 10 years, according to market gauge derived from the yields on U.S. Treasury securities. That’s down from 3 percent in April and close to the Fed’s goal.

It’s worth remembering that Greenspan’s reputation for omniscience did not last. During the 2008 financial crisis, as trillions of dollars in wealth vaporized and the jobless ranks swelled, critics in Congress cited the near collapse of the U.S. banking system as evidence that his faith in the industry’s ability to police itself had been misplaced.

Testifying in October 2008 before the House Government Oversight Committee, Greenspan confessed that the crisis had exposed “a flaw” in his thinking.

“I still do not fully understand why it happened,” he said.

His successor is determined to do better. Powell has vowed to defeat inflation, whatever the cost and time required. Not having all the answers is no excuse for inaction."
May 13 2022,"What BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street Are Doing to the Economy",Farhad Manjoo,left,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/12/opinion/vanguard-power-blackrock-state-street.html,"When I got on the phone with Vivek Ramaswamy on Tuesday afternoon, I was not expecting to find common cause. Ramaswamy is a tech entrepreneur, a frequent contributor to conservative outlets such as The Wall Street Journal’s editorial page and the author of a book whose very title sounds as if it had been formulated in a lab at Fox News to maximally tickle the base and trigger the libs: “Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam.”

I’d reached out to Ramaswamy to discuss his new venture, Strive Asset Management, an investment firm that he says will urge corporations to stay out of politics. Among Strive’s funders, though, is one of the more politically active people in business, Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who supported Donald Trump and is now funding a slate of Trump-loving congressional candidates.

It turned out I was right: I did not agree with a lot of what Ramaswamy had to say. Not only are our politics radically at odds, we also differ on what “politics” means in modern American capitalism. Yet despite our disagreements, something odd happened. I found myself nodding along with what is perhaps Ramaswamy’s fundamental point: that three gigantic American asset management firms — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — control too much of the global economy.

The firms manage funds invested by large institutions like pension funds and university endowments as well as those for companies and, in some cases, individual investors like me and perhaps you, too. Their holdings are colossal. BlackRock manages nearly $10 trillion in investments. Vanguard has $8 trillion, and State Street has $4 trillion. Their combined $22 trillion in managed assets is the equivalent of more than half of the combined value of all shares for companies in the S&P 500 (about $38 trillion). Their power is expected to grow. An analysis published in the Boston University Law Review in 2019 estimated that the Big Three could control as much as 40 percent of shareholder votes in the S&P 500 within two decades."
Jan 10 2016,3 reasons the economy boomed in 2015,Vox,left,http://www.vox.com/2016/1/9/10737798/cheap-gas-easy-money,"December's job growth numbers are in, and they make it official: 2015 was the second-strongest year for job growth since the 1990s, and only slightly behind the big gains of 2014. Unemployment fell in 2015 from an already low 5.6 percent at the end of 2014 to 5 percent in December 2015. Wages grew 2.5 percent during 2015, which isn't a huge number but looks more impressive when you remember that inflation was close to zero for the year.

So what accounts for the second straight year of strong economic results? The US economy is a complex system, so it would be a mistake to point to any single factor as driving economic growth and job creation. No one fully understands how and why economies grow. And to some extent, you could look at 2015's solid but not spectacular performance as the kind of thing that happens when there's nothing holding the economy back.

But we can also identify several specific factors that positively influenced economic growth in 2015.

Relatively easy money

Short-term interest rates fell to zero percent in 2008, and the Federal Reserve kept them there until December 2015. Lower interest rates tend to promote economic growth and job creation. Some people believe the Fed should have done even more — earlier in the recession the Fed ran a series of ""quantitative easing"" programs to pump even more money into the economy, which it phased out in 2014 — but there's little doubt that the Fed's decision to keep interest rates near zero percent for most of the year promoted faster job growth than an earlier interest rate hike would have done.

In December, the Federal Reserve raised its target interest rate by 0.25 percent, and signaled that it may increase rates further in 2016. That may create a drag on the economy this year.

Plunging oil prices

Oil prices were high — around $100 per barrel from 2011 until mid-2014. But then prices started to fall, and they haven't stopped since. They were around $50 per barrel when 2015 began, and they've now fallen below $35 per barrel.

Energy is an important input to lots of different products and services, so cheaper oil (and other fossil fuels like natural gas) meant that everyone not associated with the oil industry had a bit of extra cash in their pockets in 2015.

It's hard to say exactly where that extra cash went — at least some of it went to boost people's savings and pay down debt — but consumers also spent some of it on other stuff. That provided a nice economic tailwind throughout 2015.

Governments hiring and spending more

Since the Great Recession, state and local governments have been tightening their belts. Early in the recession, this added to the magnitude of job losses; later, it partially offset job gains in the private sector.

Cheaper oil meant that almost everyone had a bit of extra cash in their pockets

But as this data from the Brookings Institution shows, things started to change in mid-2014. After years of shedding employees, state and local governments started hiring again.

Overall, Brookings estimates that federal, state, and local government spending and tax policies exerted a modestly positive effect on the growth of gross domestic product — that's after four years of spending cuts and tax hikes that Brookings argues imposed a net fiscal drag on economic growth."
Apr 07 2023,"US job growth slows in March as economy adds 236,000 new positions",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-march-2023,"U.S. hiring slowed in March as the once rock-solid labor market began to soften in the face of high interest rates and stubborn inflation.

Employers added 236,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, mostly in line with the 239,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, ticked lower to 3.5% as the labor force participation rate increased to the highest level since before the pandemic began.

It marked the lowest monthly jobs gain since December 2020.

While monthly jobs data is always important, the Federal Reserve is closely watching this particular report for signs the labor market is finally cooling as policymakers try to tame inflation with a series of interest-rate hikes.

JOB CUTS SURGED 15% IN MARCH, AND LARGE-SCALE LAYOFFS 'WILL LIKELY CONTINUE:' REPORT

There was some welcoming news on that front, with monthly wages rising at the slowest pace since June 2021. Average hourly earnings grew 4.2% from a year ago, below the estimate of 4.3%.

""Employment growth has not yet collapsed, though there are visible signs of continued moderation,"" said Kathy Bostjancic, Nationwide chief economist. ""In all the Federal Reserve will be pleased by the details of the employment report, but still is supportive of another rate hike in May – which we think could be the last for the tightening cycle, followed by a long pause.""

Although the stock market is closed for Good Friday, futures rose following the report.

JOBLESS CLAIMS COME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AHEAD OF MARCH JOBS REPORT

Leisure and hospitality led the job gains last month, with payrolls growing by 72,000. The bulk of that increase stemmed from hiring at restaurants and bars, which added 50,300 workers in March. Other notable job gains took place in government (47,000), professional and business services (39,000) and health care (33,900). Retail shed 14,600 jobs.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, but there are growing signs of a slowdown. A separate report released Wednesday showed there were about 9.9 million job openings in February, the first time since May 2021 that the number of available jobs dipped below 10 million. However, job openings remain historically high. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020, the highest on record was 7.6 million. There are still roughly 1.7 jobs per unemployed American.

There has also been a wave of notable layoffs over the past few months, and the list grows longer by the day. Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft, Facebook, Google, IBM and Twitter are among the companies letting workers go.

ARE TECH LAYOFFS THE CANARY IN THE US JOBS MARKET?

Job losses could soon bleed into the broader labor market. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear that policymakers anticipate job growth will slow and unemployment could climb as the Fed raises interest rates higher, but he has argued that an alternative where prices soar unchecked is worse.

For many economists, the possibility of unemployment rising has become a question of when not if.

Apr 04 2023,‘The Positives Are Huge’: JPMorgan Chase CEO Changes His Tune About The Economy,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/the-positives-are-huge-jpmorgan-chase-ceo-changes-his-tune-about-the-economy,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon expressed confidence about the future of the American economy despite the recent banking crisis that gripped the nation and his pessimistic comments last year.

Dimon, regarded as one of the most powerful investment bankers on Wall Street, wrote in his annual shareholder letter that elevated consumer spending and the massive savings that households accumulated during the lockdown-induced recession are likely to produce a strong economy in the near future, notwithstanding the market volatility of the past year.

“Unemployment is extremely low, and wages are going up, particularly at the low end,” the executive wrote. “Even if we go into a recession, consumers would enter it in far better shape than during the great financial crisis. Finally, supply chains are recovering, businesses are pretty healthy and credit losses are extremely low.”

Dimon commented only last summer that JPMorgan Chase would prepare for an imminent economic “hurricane” and said his firm would “be very conservative” with their balance sheet. The executive shifted his position and expressed optimism that the “hurricane” has been downgraded to “storm clouds” that he hopes will “peacefully and painlessly dissipate.”

He added in the letter that discussion about risk “begins to cloud your judgment” and distracts from true economic realities. “Looking ahead, the positives are huge,” he continued.

The shareholder letter comes weeks after American medium-sized financial institutions Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank unexpectedly collapsed as depositors rushed to withdraw their balances, prompting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to assume control of the firms. Credit Suisse, a Swiss investment bank and formerly the eighth largest in the world, was acquired by competitor UBS amid lackluster risk and compliance management.

Dimon, who leads the largest investment bank in the world, asserted in the letter that the failures “underscore that simply satisfying regulatory requirements is not sufficient” for banks to ensure their own durability through tumultuous conditions. He said that the risks in the American banking sector were “hiding in plain sight” due to investment exposure from rising interest rates and the high percentage of uninsured depositors.

A bond portfolio sold by Silicon Valley Bank to cover withdrawals had declined substantially in value amid Federal Reserve actions to hike interest rates. Assets in the banking system are now $2 trillion lower than their book value due to the rollback in monetary stimulus, which had been previously maintained to stimulate the economy during the recession, according to a study from analysts at the National Bureau of Economic Research.

Dimon clarified that the present volatility is not nearly as severe as the conditions which induced the 2008 financial crisis.

“As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come,” he wrote. “This current banking crisis involves far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.”

Dimon also cited the robust business climate in the United States and called the federal government a “very important silent partner” in protecting a stable economy relative to those in other nations. He referenced Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett’s sentiment that his firm’s success is “predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates.”"

Jun 30 2023,What Supreme Court ruling against Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan could mean for the U.S. economy,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/30/what-supreme-court-student-loan-forgiveness-ruling-means-for-the-economy.html,"Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao | Moment | Getty Images

The Supreme Court struck down the Biden administration's student loan forgiveness plan Friday. While the bombshell ruling will undoubtedly be a blow to borrowers who had hoped — perhaps even expected — they'd have up to $20,000 of their student debt erased, the verdict is unlikely to be consequential for the U.S. economy at large, economists said. ""The Supreme Court decision to strike down loan forgiveness should have no meaningful impact on the economy,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

The fight against inflation gets a boost

It's challenging to judge the economic effect of a sweeping policy such as student loan forgiveness. If it had passed, it might have had a few broad, though marginal, effects on the economy, experts said. For one, debt relief might have raised the standard of living for millions of households. With debt payments erased, consumers would have had more wiggle room in their budgets and would have pumped more money into the economy, economists said. Estimates suggest consumers would spend about 3% to 6% of their increased wealth on new or accelerated purchases, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Supreme Court strikes down student loan forgiveness plan

4 strategies to avoid taking on too much student debt

These moves can help you save big on college costs That dynamic may have exacerbated inflation, said economists. Put another way, if consumers had more wealth — as much as $20,000 — to spend on goods and services, that may have served to prop up prices. Overturning student loan forgiveness is therefore somewhat deflationary and means the Federal Reserve may not have to raise borrowing costs as much as it otherwise would if forgiveness succeeded, economists said. Inflation has fallen significantly to a 4% annual rate from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak but remains elevated above the central bank's 2% long-term target. ""This will work in the direction of further slowing consumer spending,"" said Shai Akabas, executive director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. ""And that will directionally contribute toward the Fed's goal of getting inflation back to its target level.""

Borrowers may cut back on purchases

Consumer spending is the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, accounting for about 70% of U.S. gross domestic product, a measure of the nation's total economic output. The Supreme Court's ruling is unlikely to trigger a big pullback in household spending, in an aggregate sense, economists said. That's because nothing much has changed relative to household balance sheets. They owed the debt before and still do today, Zandi said. ""I'm sure [those borrowers] who applied for forgiveness are disappointed, but I don't think it'll have any bearing on their financial situation, because nothing has changed,"" he said. However, the resumption of monthly student loan payments in October, after a three-year pause, will likely have a bigger effect. Moody's estimates those payments to be about $275 a month for the average borrower.

watch now

But again, the effect of resumed payments will likely be muted at a macro level, economists said. For example, more than 40 million Americans have student loan debt, while about 287 million do not, said Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. Quinlan estimates resumed monthly debt payments for this group, in combination with the effect of the upended loan forgiveness plan, would reduce annual U.S. consumer spending 0.5%, at the high end of the estimate range. ""It barely moves the needle in terms of broad measures of consumer spending,"" Quinlan said of the macro effect. At a micro level, however, ""it's a big deal for the households that are impacted,"" Quinlan said.

Recession fears remain

The timing of this expected spending pullback, however small, is precarious, economists said. Many economists forecast the U.S. to enter a mild recession later this year or in 2024, due to factors such as higher interest rates and tighter lending standards after recent turmoil in the banking sector. The concern is that the aggregate effect of student loan policies — a resumption of loan payments and overturned forgiveness — may incrementally ""add fuel to the fire,"" Quinlan said. Federal data issued Friday suggests consumer spending has already slowed significantly. That said, there are student loan policies that have already been enacted by the Biden administration that will likely help borrowers affected by Friday's Supreme Court ruling, economists said."
Mar 10 2015,What the economy means for 2016,CNN (Online News),left,http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/06/politics/democrats-economy-2016/index.html,"CNN —

Democrats suddenly have a good problem on their hands — an economy that is roaring back.

Friday marked the latest in a string of positive labor market news: 295,000 jobs were created in February, far surpassing most economists’ expectations. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to 5.5%, a level not seen since before the eruption of the financial crisis.

But while the February jobs report was a reminder of just how far the economic recovery has come since President Barack Obama first took office six years ago, it also raises a fresh dilemma for the president’s Democratic colleagues looking to keep the White House and win back the Senate in 2016.

If the economic recovery emerges as a key part of the party’s 2016 campaign message, Democrats run the risk of having to retrace their steps if the growth fizzles out or, worse, takes a downward turn.

For the time being, Democrats are being careful not to overplay their hand.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi hailed Friday’s jobs report as a “momentous milestone in the longest uninterrupted stretch of private job creation in our history,” before remarking that “more needs to be done.”

READ: Jobs Day circus is back

Jason Furman, Obama’s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, similarly referred to “another strong employment report” on Friday, but went on to add that “additional steps are needed to continue strengthening wages for the middle class.”

Former Minnesota Congressman Vin Weber, who served as an economic adviser to the Republican Party’s 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said Democrats risk a “mission accomplished” moment if they’re too celebratory this early on in the 2016 cycle.

“That’s not an easy message to deliver whether it’s in war and peace or in the economic arena,” said Weber, who has signed on to advise Jeb Bush’s expected White House campaign. “People don’t want to be told that all their problems have been solved and everything good so it’s a little bit tricky.”

Dig a little deeper into the small print of Friday’s jobs report, and there are plenty of reasons for voters to remain skeptical about the economic recovery.

Wages were once again a weak spot in the February jobs report, rising just 2 percent from the year before. The U.S. labor force contracted last month — a sign that the unemployment rate fell in part because fewer people were looking for work, rather than because a bigger chunk of the labor force found jobs.

READ: Another cliff for Congress?

Meanwhile, the end of 2014 clocked in lackluster growth, with gross domestic product expanding at a disappointing 2.2% in the final three months of the year, according to the government’s most recent estimate.

These data points have plenty of economists warning that the recent spike in jobs growth is bound to level off as the 2016 campaign kicks into high gear.

“We can’t add 250,000 or 300,000 jobs per month indefinitely. We just don’t have the people to do that,” said Gus Faucher, PNC’s senior macroeconomist. “What we’ll see is something close to 250,000 jobs per month this year and 200,000 per month next year.”

Michael Feroli, JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist, said it would be difficult to sustain the level of jobs growth from recent months particularly if GDP growth doesn’t pick up significantly.

“I’d like to say it’s sustainable but I don’t think it is,” Feroli said. “To sustain 280,000-type numbers month after month, you’d need really strong GDP growth and that just doesn’t seem like that’s in the cards right now.”

Meanwhile, the economic news poses a different set of challenges for Republicans.

Just two years ago, the party’s presidential nominee made an aggressive campaign against Obama’s economic policies. The economic environment was drastically different then — it was only several months out from the 2012 elections that the unemployment rate slipped beneath 8% for the first time since January 2009.

With the unemployment rate stabilizing, Republicans are now looking to to focus on issues other than the economy, such as foreign policy, as they head toward 2016.

At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference last month, top national Republicans rarely discussed the health of the economy. Instead, they delivered fiery speeches condemning Obama’s weak record on national security and rallied conservative activists by vowing to take on the country’s enemies like ISIS.

“What really matters is not so much what the economy looks like today, but rather where it is about a year from now,” said Mark McKinnon, former adviser to George W. Bush. “I think the fact that it looks relatively good right now is why you see so much foreign policy focus in the Republican primaries.”"
Dec 06 2022,Why Mark Zandi says the US economy will narrowly avoid a recession,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/economy/zandi-us-could-avoid-recession/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

Inflation is cooling. Consumers are still spending. And hiring is slowing — but not collapsing. That’s why Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi is increasingly confident that the American economy will — narrowly — escape a recession.

“It’s going to be a struggle. It’s going to feel uncomfortable. But I think we are going to thread the needle,” Zandi told CNN Business in a phone interview earlier this week.

Zandi, whose forecasts are often cited by the White House, pointed to recent economic and market indicators that suggest the economy is not falling off a cliff despite widespread fears of a recession.

“The data over the last couple of months have been better than I would have thought. None of the financial market indicators suggest we have a recession dead ahead,” Zandi said.

New numbers released on Thursday show inflation, as measured by the Federal Reserve’s favorite metric, eased in October. That is raising hopes the US central bank can slow the pace of its massive interest rate hikes as soon as this month.

The US economy also grew faster in the third quarter than initially estimated, bouncing back from two quarters of contraction.

And in a big positive for inflation-weary consumers, gas prices have plunged. The national average for regular gas is now below where it was when Russia invaded Ukraine and down sharply from the record high in June.

“My baseline is still no recession. That has not changed. But I do feel more confident than I did a few months ago,” said Zandi. “Inflation is moderating. Oil prices are stable to down. Employment growth is slowing. Layoffs are normalizing.”

Manufacturing stumbles, layoffs increase

Of course, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about what lies ahead and there are many reasons to be concerned about a potential downturn — including the most aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve in decades.

Zandi said he wouldn’t argue with those who forecast a recession, conceding it’s going to be a “close” call.

A slew of major companies have announced layoffs of more than 1,000 jobs apiece in recent days, including AMC Networks, DoorDash and crypto exchange Kraken. That’s on top of mass layoffs that have wiped out tens of thousands of jobs in the tech sector, including major cuts at Amazon, Twitter and Facebook owner Meta.

Factories are also coming under significant pressure. A survey released Thursday by the Institute for Supply Management found that manufacturing activity contracted in November for the first time since May 2020.

“Overall, things are worsening,” one executive from a maker of electrical equipment, appliances and components said in the ISM survey. “Housing starts are down. We’re doing well against our competitors, but the industry overall is down. We’re sitting on cash (that is) tied up in inventory.”

‘Mild’ recession still a risk

Some business leaders are warning a downturn is likely still in the cards.

Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told CNN’s Poppy Harlow on Tuesday that the economy will probably slip into a recession next year — though he’s hopeful it will be a “mild” one.

In a report on Monday, S&P Global Ratings said just one of the nine leading economic indicators it tracks was in positive territory through October. S&P reiterated it expects the US economy to fall into recession next year, though it expects a “mild” recession in line with the 1969-1970 downturn. S&P forecasts peak-to-trough US GDP will decline by just 0.8%.

Zandi said he thinks all of these recession fears could end up working to the economy’s advantage by discouraging risky behavior, forcing businesses to keep cash on hand and persuading officials in Washington to make prudent decisions.

For instance, he pointed to President Joe Biden’s decision this week to call on Congress to act to prevent a crippling freight rail strike.

“I bet if we weren’t worried about a recession, the president wouldn’t have been so quick to go to Congress,” Zandi said. “Everyone is on high alert and very cautious. The fact we are so nervous about a recession makes it less likely something will go wrong.”"
Feb 12 2020,Who deserves credit for the strong economy?,Yahoo! The 360,center,https://news.yahoo.com/who-deserves-credit-for-the-strong-economy-214055629.html,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

During his State of the Union address last week, President Trump touted the strength of the U.S. economy. “I am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been,” he said. Though some may quibble with such a bold statement, there’s no question that — at least by certain metrics — the economy is booming.

The economy is in the midst of the longest expansion in American history, as it continues to grow from the worst days of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at the lowest rate in 50 years, and the stock market has spiked to record levels.

A strong economy may be the most potent argument Trump has as he campaigns to win a second term. Even though a president’s influence on the economy is limited, voters tend to reward them when it’s strong and punish them when it’s weak. The last two incumbents to lose reelection, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, were defeated during flagging economies.

Why there’s debate

Trump’s supporters say he deserves praise for the historic highs the economy has reached since he took office. They credit his trillion-dollar tax cut and the trade battles with China, Mexico and others for boosting investment and creating jobs in the U.S.

Trump’s detractors say the gains made in the past three years are merely an extension of the progress Barack Obama set in motion. Not only did Obama prevent another depression, they argue, but he also built a solid foundation on which the current economic expansion has grown. Others say Trump has weakened the country’s long-term prospects by cutting taxes and increasing spending to create a short burst of growth that will ultimately destabilize the economy.

Another group rejects the idea that the economy is doing as well as it may seem. Most of the gains have been experienced by the wealthy, while the working class has fallen further behind, they argue.

What’s next

Though the economy is still growing, the rate of that growth slowed last year to the lowest levels in the Trump presidency. Whether that’s a sign the economic upswing is reaching its peak is unclear, economists say. Economies can’t grow forever, and another recession will come eventually.

Perspectives

Supporters

Trump deserves credit

“The Trump administration’s policies have finally produced the economic benefits that American workers should have experienced coming out of the recession but did not.” — Andy Puzder, Washington Post

Trump’s policies have directly led to economic growth

“Those things aren’t good luck or accidental. They’re the results of capitalism and a Republican president who passed the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and removed job-killing regulations that were stifling the business sector under the prior administration.” — Adriana Cohen, Fox News

Voters recognize Trump’s positive influence

“Trump’s policies have sparked the greatest economic renaissance America has seen in decades, and no amount of political spin can conceal that fact from the millions of Americans who are better off today thanks to his efforts.” — Julio Gonzalez, South Florida Sun Sentinel

Obama gets too much credit for the recovery

“Barack Obama inherited an economy with nowhere to go but up, and what followed was the slowest recovery since World War II. President Trump inherited an economy theoretically overdue for a recession and already returned to what economists considered full employment.” — Tiana Lowe, Washington Examiner

Critics

Trump is riding Obama’s momentum

“Overall, the economic metrics Trump beats his chest about are continuations of trends that started during the Obama administration, suggesting that the country has been climbing out of a recession for many years, not that Trump’s policies were necessarily transformative.” — Harry Cheadle, Vox

Down-ballot Democrats have helped more than Trump

“Poverty rates are falling not because of GOP tax cuts and the resulting ballooning of both inequality and the federal deficit, and not because of deregulation that makes the environment dirtier and workplaces less safe. They are falling mainly because Democratic-controlled cities and states are raising the minimum wage in the face of federal inaction, and are looking for ways to increase access to health insurance.” — Sasha Abramskyy, The Nation

The working class is being left behind by Trump’s policies

“The economy is not working for average Americans. … Rather than helping, President Trump has broken his promise to stand up for average Americans. When facing a choice, he has regularly chosen the rich and powerful over the economic security of middle-class Americans.” — Christian Weller, Forbes

Trump’s short-term thinking has weakened the economy going forward

“It’s hard to see how the short-term sugar high can come close to balancing the long-term costs of ignoring climate change, the large budget deficits and the trade war. Actually, not hard. Impossible.” — Alan Blinder, Time

It’s complicated

Neither Trump nor Obama deserves full credit

“Presidents always get more credit for good economies — and more blame for bad ones — than they deserve.” — Alan S. Blinder, Wall Street Journal

The economy isn’t as strong as metrics make it look

“Suicide rates are at a record high in the post-World War II era, and more Americans die every two weeks from drugs, alcohol and suicide — “deaths of despair” — than died in 18 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq. These deaths are symptoms of a larger economic malaise for working-class Americans that predates Trump.” — Nicholas Kristof, New York Times

The relief was, however, short-lived. Stocks quickly began falling again. The Nasdaq wouldn’t regain the level it reached on Greenspan Day until, wait for it, 2012.

Apr 10 2022,"War, economy could weaken Putin’s place as leader",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-kyiv-business-europe-3d30a3dc9099c431cd7f8a606057f75b,"NEW YORK (AP) — With the Russian military in retreat from around Kyiv and facing condemnation for brutal tactics, harsh political repression at home and the economy buffeted by Western sanctions, adversaries and allies alike are raising the same question about President Vladimir Putin: Can he hold onto power?

The answer: For now, but maybe not forever.

After 22 years in power, Putin has built a powerful phalanx of loyalists who surround him, both in the Russian military and the secret services. He also has significant support among the Russian people, who are steeped in pro-Putin propaganda through the Russian leader’s almost total control of television and other mass communication. Even today, many Russians view his leadership as having delivered greater prestige, prosperity and stability for the country over two decades.

This edifice of protection, the vast wealth Putin controls and the lack of any significant history of palace coups in Russia make either of the obvious means of removing Putin — a military mutiny or a mass popular “color” revolution — almost inconceivable right now.

Yet all strongman states are inherently vulnerable to the unforeseen — especially when they become deaf to the society around them. Just ask Hosni Mubarak.

“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” declared President Joe Biden of Putin last month in Poland. It was an unscripted but heartfelt comment as the bloodletting in Ukraine has mounted.

The 69-year-old Putin is up for re-election in 2024, and changes in the Russian constitution conceivably would allow him to remain president until 2036. But the imprisonment of Russia’s best-known opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, is just one sign that Putin is not confident enough of his popularity to submit to an actual democratic test.

While there can be no credible polling in a country now effectively under martial law, the number of Russians informed and courageous enough to protest against the war in Ukraine so far has numbered in the thousands, not the hundreds of thousands.

Tens of thousands of affluent citizens, intellectuals and political critics have abandoned Russia rather than remain under the tight controls Putin has imposed, finding escape in Istanbul, Tbilisi or cities in the West. This brain drain no doubt will hurt Russia in the future. But at the moment, their departure removes a possible nexus of opposition from the society.

Of course, history is unpredictable. Few anticipated the rapid dissolution of the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s. If Russian casualties in Ukraine are as high as has been reported — 15,000 or more dead and three times that wounded in the space of six weeks — those results eventually will begin filtering through the society in spite of official censorship.

Arguably, the USSR’s fate was sealed in 1986 after its then-leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, loosened the Communist Party’s iron grip on information and set sights on the restructuring of the Soviet Union’s stagnating economy in order to better compete with the West. That was the year of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, when the Politburo — after initially trying to cover up the disaster — was forced to disclose it to the Soviet public. The Soviet war in Afghanistan, meanwhile, had turned into a quagmire, leading to withdrawal in 1988-89.

In 1988, when Polish workers loyal to the independent Solidarity union movement launched a series of strikes in coal mines and shipyards, Gorbachev signaled that he would not intervene in one of the Soviet Union’s key satellite states. Then-Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, whose 1981 imposition of martial law had led that country nowhere, opted instead to open up talks with the strikers’ leader, Lech Walesa. The result: partly democratic elections.

That in turn set in motion a series of dominoes within the Eastern European countries, with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania all seeking to escape Soviet dominance and Communist rule. Before long, the fever had spread to the Baltic countries that were part of the Soviet Union itself, and nationalist emotions flared across the union.

Hardliners in Moscow who had seen enough attempted a coup against Gorbachev, but they were too late. That quickly was overturned by the popular outpouring of support led by Boris Yeltsin. On Dec. 31, 1991, both Gorbachev and the Soviet Union had been swept aside when the Soviet Union ended.

Putin, at the time an intelligence agent in East Germany, lived through the events and has drawn appropriate conclusions to maintain control now. Even before the war in Ukraine, he worked to shape public opinion by portraying the Ukrainians as Nazis who threatened Russia. Then, he clamped down on independent media organizations and the few remaining civil society groups.

More recently, he has imposed draconian anti-media laws that ban telling the Russia public anything about the war that conflicts with the Kremlin’s chosen narrative about the “special military operation.” Dissenters and doubters have been branded as scum and gnats, worthy only to be spat out.

Aside from Gorbachev, the sole Soviet leader to be removed was Nikita Khrushchev, whose 11 years in power ended in 1964.

He was forced out by his closest associates in the Communist Party. Disturbed by a series of disastrous economic decisions, a failed initiative to install nuclear weapons in Cuba and the signs that Khrushchev intended to build a cult of personality, fellow members of the Communist Presidium denounced him in a closed meeting while he was away.

When he returned, realizing that he had lost all support, Khrushchev agreed to step aside on fictional grounds of ill health. He soon was rendered a nonperson within the Soviet Union, as his successor Leonid Brezhnev assumed the leadership. But again, Khrushchev’s bloodless removal was unique.

Could something like that happen to Putin as economic conditions worsen, or if the Ukrainian invasion is a disaster for Russia?

Unlike the Soviet Union, there is little in the way of an institutional party structure that could intervene to topple him. Putin has cronies, yes men, and a coterie of “siloviki” — people of power awash in hard-nosed nationalist thinking of the FSB and military — none of whom so far dare to show the least independence from Putin’s Ukraine war “project.”

Yet losses on the battlefield have already led to an apparent paring-down of military goals, angering and disappointing some anti-Ukraine pundits on Russian TV.

While Putin’s coterie has every incentive to stay close for the time being or risk losing privileges and wealth, if the war in Ukraine drags on for months or years, and Putin’s adventure becomes the mammoth disaster that it appears to be so far, it is almost certain that cracks will emerge.

Absent Russia’s total victory over Ukraine, it already is difficult to imagine the world going back to business as usual with Vladimir Putin. He could find himself boxed into a grinding, open-ended conflict on his border and facing a need to impose more and more repression at home to stifle dissent in a population paying the economic consequences of the invasion.

Aging leaders rarely last forever or have the luxury to leave office on their own terms. Whether it is by elections, revolt or an internal mutiny, the long days of Putin’s rule may well be numbered.

Apr 13 2022,What are zero-covid lockdowns costing China’s economy?,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/2150257/what-zero-covid-lockdowns-cost-chinas-gdp/,"China’s 5.5% GDP target for 2022 is the least ambitious goal the country has had in three decades, but it’s already looking challenging in the face of ongoing lockdowns, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

China’s continued zero-covid approach is “bound to pose another headwind to the already decelerating economic growth,” said a note from French investment bank Natixis in March, predicting that the sharp reduction in mobility in China could shave off 1.8 percentage points from its first-quarter growth, due on Monday (April 18).

For the year, China can achieve a growth rate of 4% to 4.5% if it can significantly improve vaccination coverage by the end of this month, added Natixis’s chief Asia-Pacific economist Alicia García Herrero. Though China has delivered enough doses to cover nearly 90% of its population, larger gaps exist for older groups or in rural areas.

Iris Pang, chief economist at Dutch financial firm ING, estimated last week that Shanghai will see its GDP shrink 6% if the current lockdowns persist through this month, which could translate into a 2% GDP loss for the whole of China. It revised its estimate for growth for the full year to 4.6% from 4.8% earlier.

The strongest warnings about China’s economy, however, have been coming from premier Li Keqiang. Li on Monday (April 11) said at a seminar that downward pressure on growth has intensified, and that local officials must move with “a sense of urgency” on stimulus measures such as infrastructure projects and tax reductions.

Lockdowns depress China’s factory activity

In March, China’s manufacturing activity slumped to a two-year low due to disruptions caused by covid prevention measures, as well as canceled export orders amid the uncertainty from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to a monthly index by Caixin/Markit. “In Q1, manufacturing continued to lose momentum, while retailing got battered, even before lockdowns began,” said Shehzad Qazi, managing director of economic data tracking firm China Beige Book.

In the final month of the quarter, tech hub Shenzhen underwent a one-week lockdown, while Shanghai embarked on a two-part citywide lockdown on March 28 that remains largely in place. An April 3 analysis based on city-to-city trucking flows (pdf) estimated that putting an economic hub like Shanghai under a one-month lockdown would knock 2.7% off China’s GDP. For a two-week shutdown, that’s a loss of about $20 billion, according to a rough calculation. The city on Monday relaxed restrictions for districts with no new covid cases for two weeks, but much of the city is still under strict lockdown, and factory and port operations aren’t at full steam.

Meanwhile, factory prices rose 8.3% in March, more than expected.

Beijing’s tough economic choices

Beijing has been trying for years to shift away from debt-funded infrastructure investment and rely more on domestic consumption for economic growth. But zero-covid protocols could force it to fall back on old habits.

“To hit the target…one thing you can do is to stimulate the economy more but that will take the government further away from the de-leveraging, de-risking, and other policies which they want to pursue to try to rebalance the economy,” independent analyst George Magnus, former chief economist at Swiss bank UBS, told Quartz.

Local governments have pledged around $2.3 trillion for building projects this year, according to Bloomberg. Beijing has also announced plans for 400 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.

China hasn’t yet opted for demand-side stimulus, such as the checks sent out to individuals in the US, or Hong Kong’s consumption vouchers. Though retail sales grew more than expected in the first two months of the year, March will be a different story. In addition, China’s tech crackdown dealt a blow to the prospects and spending power of young people, including this year’s nearly 11 million upcoming university graduates.

“What is becoming clear is that China’s consumption growth will be decided almost entirely by covid policies for the foreseeable future, and any progress remains vulnerable to a quick reversal,” Qazi, of China Beige Book, told Quartz."
May 05 2023,"US job growth unexpectedly jumps in April as economy adds 253,000 new positions",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-april-2023,"U.S. job growth continued to chug along at a healthy clip in April, as the labor market remained surprisingly resilient even in the face of rising interest rates, declining economic growth and bank turmoil.

Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, easily beating the 180,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 3.4%, a historically low level, as more workers left the labor force.

Wages also accelerated last month, with average hourly earnings – a key measure of inflation – rising 0.5%, more than the 0.3% estimate. On an annual basis, wages rose 4.4% in April.

Although the report pointed to solid hiring in April, it also showed much weaker job growth over the previous two months. Gains for February and March were revised down by a total of 149,000 jobs to a respective 248,000 and 165,000, the government said.

FED RAISES INTEREST RATES A QUARTER POINT, HINTS AT POSSIBLE PAUSE

The Federal Reserve is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally softening after months of strong job gains as policymakers try to wrestle inflation under control. Although the consumer price index has cooled from a peak of 9.1% in June, it remains about three times higher than the pre-pandemic average.

The stronger-than-expected jobs figure, coupled with a burst in wage growth, could be a worrisome sign for the Fed, which approved a 10th straight interest rate hike on Wednesday afternoon before opening the door to a pause in the tightening cycle.

ARE TECH LAYOFFS THE CANARY IN THE US JOBS MARKET?

""Robust jobs numbers in the face of ongoing regional bank stress and debt ceiling uncertainty speaks to the strength of our economy, but it complicates the fight against inflation,"" said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. ""Today’s strong jobs report may be good news for job seekers, but it may make it more difficult for the Fed.""

Job gains were broad-based last month, with the biggest gains in professional and business services (43,000), health care (40,000) and leisure and hospitality (31,000). Even industries that are more sensitive to higher interest rates, like construction and manufacturing, added workers last month.

Still, the outlook for the labor market remains hazy.

A spate of bank collapses this spring is threatening to further restrict economic growth and hiring by tightening lending standards and making it more difficult to acquire a loan. Borrowers may have to agree to more stringent terms like high interest rates as banks try to reduce the financial risk on their end. Fewer loans, in turn, would lead to less big-ticket spending by consumers and businesses.

SILVER LINING OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES: SAVINGS ACCOUNT RATES

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that tighter credit conditions are likely to weigh on economic activity, including hiring and inflation.

There has also been a wave of notable layoffs over the past few months, and the list continues to grow. Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft, Facebook, Google, IBM, Morgan Stanley and Twitter are among the companies letting workers go.

For many economists, the possibility of unemployment rising has become a question of when, not if.

The central bank previously projected in March that the jobless rate will climb substantially higher to 4.6% and remain elevated in 2024 and 2025 as steeper rates continue to take their toll by pushing up borrowing costs. That could amount to more than 1 million job losses."

Jan 03 2020,Ocean Acidification Threatens the U.S. Economy,Scientific American,left,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ocean-acidification-threatens-the-u-s-economy/,"Ocean acidification threatens to cause billions of dollars in damage to the U.S. economy, harming everything from crabs in Alaska to coral reefs in Florida and the Caribbean, NOAA researchers said in a new report.

Carbon dioxide emissions and ocean acidification are occurring at an ""unprecedented"" rate, deteriorating valuable fisheries and tourist destinations across the United States and its territories, NOAA said in a draft research plan for ocean acidification.

""Commercial, subsistence and recreational fishing [and] tourism and coral ecosystems"" will likely be damaged by ocean acidification, the plan said. Multibillion-dollar fisheries such as West Coast Dungeness crab, Alaska king crab and New England sea scallops are vulnerable. So are Florida's coral reefs, an asset valued at $8.5 billion.

Implicating human activities such as burning fossil fuels, the plan said that ocean acidification ""is driven by the growing amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide absorbed and dissolved in the upper ocean."" Ocean acidification makes it hard for some marine organisms such as lobsters, oysters and coral to build shells and skeletons.

The 172-page draft research plan draws on hundreds of studies and describes how NOAA will continue to analyze ocean acidification in the 2020s as part of a congressional mandate. The NOAA plan is unique in that it assesses the threat of ocean acidification nationwide, in contrast to other research that might focus on a specific part of the country.

Two U.S. regions appear particularly endangered: Alaska, with its lucrative seafood industry, and the Florida Keys, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, whose coral reefs attract tourists and protect against flood damage and coastal erosion.

""Alaska waters are especially vulnerable to OA,"" the research plan said, using the acronym for ocean acidification. Most vulnerable are Alaska communities that rely on subsistence crab harvests and communities with fishing economies.

Alaska's seafood industry employs more than 50,000 people, pays $2 billion a year in wages, and includes the nation's largest and most valuable crab fishery. It also is an essential part of the state's culture and identity, which ocean acidification jeopardizes.

""The harvest of marine resources plays a critical role in the identities and well-being of Alaska communities,"" NOAA's research plan said. ""More so than any other Americans, Alaskans rely upon subsistence harvests of marine resources to meet their daily nutritional needs.""

In the Florida Keys, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, ocean acidification is creating ""a great urgency"" because the region features sensitive coral reef ecosystems and commercially important fisheries, NOAA said.

Coral reefs in southeast Florida generate $4.4 billion in annual sales, $2 billion in income, and 70,400 full- and part-time jobs — ""much of which will be threatened due to OA's effects on reef-building corals,"" NOAA said.

Though valued largely for their beauty, coral reefs also ""can substantially reduce"" coastal flooding and erosion by dissipating the energy of waves hitting the shore, NOAA said. An April report by the U.S. Geological Survey found that coastal reefs protect economic activity worth $319 million a year in Florida, $118 million a year in Puerto Rico and $25 million a year in the Virgin Islands.

NOAA has not officially released its 2020-2029 research plan for ocean acidification. A draft became public in December when it was posted by NOAA's Science Advisory Board, whose reviewers called it a ""brilliant research plan.""

""This research plan captures NOAA's extraordinary effort to improve the ability to understand, protect, manage, and restore ecosystems that support healthy fisheries, increase opportunities for aquaculture, and balance conservation with tourism and recreation,"" wrote reviewers Joellen Russell of the University of Arizona, Irina Marinov of the University of Pennsylvania and Nancy Williams of the University of South Florida.

A 2009 federal law requires NOAA to monitor and research the potential effects of ocean acidification and to suggest adaptation and conservation steps.

Congress has strongly supported NOAA's ocean acidification program. The fiscal 2020 budget approved in December provides $14 million — more than double the $6 million the program got in fiscal 2014.

NOAA's proposed research plan highlights the potential harm of ocean acidification along the Pacific coast and parts of the Atlantic coast. In New England and Mid-Atlantic states as far south as North Carolina, the vulnerability to ocean acidification is ""high to medium-high.""

On the West Coast, the largest economic harm likely will occur from Northern California to northern Washington due to ""declines in Dungeness crab and groundfish.""

But the plan finds uncertainty in other places.

The impacts of ocean acidification on fisheries and aquaculture in the southeast Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ""are poorly understood"" because research on the issue is ""scarce,"" NOAA said.

In the Great Lakes, which are experiencing acidification even though they are fresh water, the potential impacts ""are largely unknown at this time,"" NOAA said.

Aug 02 2023,Janet Yellen criticizes Fitch's downgrade of U.S. credit as ‘entirely unwarranted' and insists the country has the world's 'most dynamic' economy,Fortune,center,https://fortune.com/2023/08/02/janet-yellen-comments-on-fitch-downgrade-us-credit-rating,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Wednesday slammed the move by Fitch Ratings to strip the US of its top-tier credit rating, calling it “flawed” and “entirely unwarranted.”

“Fitch’s decision is puzzling in light of the economic strength we see in the United States,” Yellen said in remarks prepared for an event in McLean, Virginia.

In the longer term, the US “remains the world’s largest, most dynamic, and most innovative economy – with the strongest financial system in the world.”

Yellen’s criticism is an echo of predecessor Timothy Geithner’s almost exactly 12 years ago, when he blasted S&P Global Ratings for “really terrible judgment” in becoming the first of the three most-cited ratings firms to remove the US from the top, AAA tier. Moody’s Investors Service is now alone in keeping the US at the highest grade.

Fitch late Tuesday cut the US to AA+, citing an erosion in financial governance, rising budget deficits and expected fiscal deterioration over the next three years.

Treasuries showed little immediate reaction to the Fitch move, but then slid Wednesday morning in the wake of stronger-than-expected jobs data. They accelerated their selloff following a bigger-than-expected plan for increased US debt issuance.

Fitch analysts drew attention to medium-term fiscal challenges that they said have been “unaddressed.” By contrast, Yellen has expressed optimism about the longer-term debt picture, saying that inflation-adjusted interest costs aren’t historically high.

The Fitch statement also said the firm anticipates the US to fall into a mild recession in late 2023, a projection that’s at odds with the assessment of a number of economists. Wednesday morning, Bank of America Corp. scrapped its own forecast for a recession, becoming the first large Wall Street bank to officially reverse its call.

Yellen said the Fitch decision “does not change what all of us already know: that Treasury securities remain the world’s preeminent safe and liquid asset, and that the American economy is fundamentally strong.”

Earlier Wednesday, one of Yellen’s top lieutenants downplayed any risk of forced selling by investors now that Fitch rates the US at AA+.

“We did not see any evidence of that in 2011” with the S&P event, Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Josh Frost told reporters Wednesday. “We continue to see robust demand for Treasury securities.”"
Oct 17 2013,Washington Is The Biggest Threat To The Economy,HuffPost,left,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/17/us-economy-biggest-threat_n_4112793.html,"By Andy Sullivan

WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Consensus may be hard to find in Washington these days, but many corporate executives and economists seem to agree on one point: the biggest risk to the world's largest economy may be its own elected representatives.

Down-to-the-wire budget and debt crises, indiscriminate spending cuts and a 16-day government shutdown may not be enough to push the U.S. economy back into recession.

But Washington's policy blunders in recent years have significantly slowed economic growth and kept roughly 2 million people out of work, according to recent estimates.

Steep spending cuts are a big reason. But the governance-by-crisis also may be prompting businesses to sit on their cash rather than building new factories, buying more equipment and hiring more workers, some economists say.

""Increasingly I'm of the view that the reason why our economy can't kick into a higher gear is because of the uncertainty created by Washington,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

Congress on Wednesday voted to re-open the government and extend its borrowing authority through February of next year. But the deal did nothing to resolve the underlying disputes that led to the crisis in the first place - leading many to fear that the standoff may play out again in a few months. The plan sets up a forum to try to forge a more permanent budget deal, but few expect it to succeed.

""We have crisis after crisis after crisis and it has a corrosive impact on the economy,"" said Greg Valliere, an analyst with Potomac Research Group. ""If you're a business, how do you make plans in this environment?""

Leading chief executives agree.

""Most CEOs I speak to in the United States say they're seeing a slowdown in business because of this,"" said Laurence Fink, the CEO of giant asset manager BlackRock Inc, in an interview on Wednesday. ""I was on a conference call with many of them, and I heard across the board, a slowdown from the American consumer because of this narrative, so it's having an impact on our economy already - and it's going to have an impact on job creation at a time when we need more job creation.""



Not all economists agree that the political circus in Washington is hurting the economy in a measurable sense. While worries over the debt ceiling have pushed up the government's borrowing costs over the past week, those increases are minimal, and the S&P 500 stock index remains near its all-time high.



SLOW RECOVERY

But the pace of recovery since the 2008-2009 recession has been unusually slow.

While America's total economic output is now higher than it was before the recession, the level of private investment remains lower than it was in 2007. Employers also continue to hire workers at a slower pace than before the recession.

Since the financial crisis eased, Washington has sent out one jolt after another. Democrats passed sweeping reforms of the healthcare system and the financial sector in 2010 which, whatever their merits, imposed wrenching changes on two pillars of the United States' post-industrial economy.

Public unease with the healthcare law helped Republicans win control of the House of Representatives in 2010, ushering in an era of divided government that has led to repeated standoffs over taxes and spending. A near-shutdown in April 2011 led to the debt-ceiling impasse in July and August of that year, which took the country to the edge of default and prompted the country's first-ever debt downgrade.

Like this most recent crisis, Congress averted disaster at the last possible moment. But the brinkmanship pushed consumer confidence to rock-bottom levels, where it remained for months. The S&P 500 tumbled 17 percent and took more than six months to recover its gains.

That debt-ceiling deal called for steep cuts to national defense, highway construction, scientific research and other forms of discretionary spending that Congress must approve annually.

Another budget deal, reached in January of this year after another round of brinkmanship, included tax increases to help narrow budget deficits further.

Neither of those deals addressed the health and retirement spending that poses the greatest threat to the country's long-term fiscal health. A failure to cut back these programs or find savings elsewhere prompted a round of deliberately disruptive across-the-board spending cuts - the so-called ""sequester"" - to take effect in March.

Advertisement

Along with an improving economy, those steps helped U.S. budget deficits fall from 8.7 percent of GDP in the 2011 fiscal year to an anticipated 3.9 percent of GDP for the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.

But this has all come at a steep cost.



JOBS NOT CREATED

In a report released on Monday, Macroeconomic Advisers estimated that 1.2 million more Americans would be working today if Congress had kept discretionary spending at the levels that were in place in 2010.

The forecasting firm estimated that Washington's erratic behavior had also driven up unemployment by a further 900,000 jobs.

Zandi estimates the fiscal austerity has cost 2.25 million jobs. Without those measures, the unemployment rate wold stand at 6.3 percent now rather than 7.7 percent, he says.

Even many of those who disagree with the notion that policy uncertainty has hurt the economy agree that the spending cuts and tax increases should have been phased in more gradually.

""Fiscal consolidation has been a big drag on the economy,"" said Paul Ashworth, an economist with Capital Economics.

The International Monetary Fund called the United States' deficit-reduction efforts ""excessively rapid and ill-designed"" in June and said the sequester cuts would nearly halve U.S. economic growth this year.

Meanwhile, Congress has punted on other important legislation like immigration reform that could boost the economy.

Construction firms have seen federal work plummet over the past several years. With the government shut down, they have been unable to use the federal E-Verify system to check workers' immigration status or get permits to build in environmentally sensitive areas, said Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America.

The delays could be more than an inconvenience for builders trying to line up financing for a new project, he said.

""You never know when the market's going to turn and ... for some reason you may have missed the boat,"" he said.

There's more turbulence on the horizon. Simonson said lawmakers may not have the stomach to avoid further cuts on transportation spending when they take up the issue next year.

Though Washington may be responsible for lackluster business on Main Street, it may not have much of an impact on Wall Street.

Many economists had expected the Federal Reserve to begin scaling back its massive monetary stimulus program last month. The chaos in Congress means it now probably won't begin pulling back its bond purchases until next year.

""I think the markets are beginning to learn how to live with Washington dysfunction,"" said Valliere. (Additional reporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Eric Walsh)

It depends.,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/05/09/hows-the-economy-doing-it-depends/,"The strength or weakness of the economy is largely in the eye of the beholder. The 2012 election (re)taught us all that lesson. Democrats insisted that President Obama has done the best he could under incredibly difficult economic conditions he inherited from former President George W. Bush. Republicans argued that Obama was clueless about how to fix the economy, resorting to growing government as his default (and only) solution.

And, with every month's jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the two sides seemed to literally be looking at totally different realities. Democrats praised what they called slow-but-steady progress. Republicans said the economy was hopelessly stuck in neutral.

(Obama wound up winning the broader argument and a second term although it's worth noting that Romney won 51 percent of all voters who said the economy was the most important issue facing the country.)

The Democrats are from Mars, Republicans are from Venus nature of the political fight over the economy is illustrated brilliantly in a new infographic from Yahoo's Chris Wilson, who is rapidly becoming the Fix's favorite data-driven journalist out there.

In the map below, Wilson allows you to compare any two years between 2000 and 2011 when it comes to job growth -- either by raw job created (or lost) or as a percentage. You can also drill down into specific job sectors to see how they did over time.

The result -- aside from being astounded at Wilson's handiwork -- is unsurprising: How the economy has done or is doing is largely dependent on the lens -- time frame, metric of success/failure -- through which you look."
May 30 2023,"Study reveals new data on how Summit Carbon, Navigator pipelines would impact SD's economy",Argus Leader,center,https://argusleader.com/story/news/2023/05/30/study-carbon-pipelines-could-add-nearly-6b-to-south-dakota-economy-summit-carbon-solutions/70244301007,"In the ongoing dialogue around carbon dioxide pipelines, companies like Summit Carbon Solutions and Navigator CO2 Ventures often tout how South Dakota could rake in tons of money from carbon sequestration. A new study from an independent group is substantiating their claim.

On May 22, Dakota Institute, an economic research group based in Sioux Falls, released ""Economic Impacts of CO2 Pipelines in South Dakota."" The 42-page report estimates how CO2 pipelines proposed by Summit Carbon and Navigation would impact South Dakota's economy.

Summit Carbon is planning to build its $4.5 billion Midwest Carbon Express pipeline across five states, including a 477-mile route through northeastern and eastern South Dakota. Navigator's $3.4 billion Heartland Greenway pipeline would cross 361 miles of land in the southeastern corner of the state along its roughly 1352-mile, six-state route.

Among the key findings of the report are indications the pipelines could bring billions of dollars of revenue to the state, while farmers stand to see an increase in corn prices from 2024 to 2034.

The logic behind these findings is that ethanol producers would be able to gain substantial increases in revenue if they adopt carbon sequestration processes. Carbon dioxide pipelines would facilitate the transportation of the greenhouse gas from biofuel plants across the Midwest, including South Dakota, to sequestration sites in North Dakota and Illinois.

What do the numbers say?

According to the study, South Dakota would see about $3.30 billion in gross domestic product, or the market value of finished goods and services, and about $5.92 billion in gross output over the ten-year period.

To put these numbers in perspective, South Dakota's largest industry, agriculture and forestry, represents 21% of the state's total GDP at $11.68 billion ― forestry alone is 2% of this figure ― according to the state's latest study on ag's economic impact. If built to completion, carbon sequestration would increase GDP in the industry by 28% over a 10-year period.

The state's total output (sales) from agriculture and forestry, as well, would also increase by 18% in that same period.

""It's a really interesting project to kind of look at these pipelines and what their potential kind of impact could be,"" Jared McEntaffer, the author of the study, told Argus Leader on Monday. ""I think we found that the pipelines could have a pretty large and significant economic impact in the state. Our job isn't to be advocates for that, though.""

A little over a quarter of the gross output estimate stems from federal tax credits. The Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a 45Z New Clean Fuel Production Credit as a lucrative incentive for ethanol producers to adopt carbon capture and sequestration processes.

45Z credits are more valuable than the already existing and similar 45Q credit. Whereas 45Q credits offer about 24 cents per gallon of ethanol for sequestering carbon dioxide, 45Z credits up to $1 and $1.75 per gallon of ethanol-based transportation and aviation fuel, respectively.

According to the study, South Dakota is the fourth-leading state in the U.S. in terms of ethanol production, and of the 13 ethanol plants currently slated to connect with either Summit Carbon or Navigator's pipeline, 1.25 million gallons could be produced annually and ‭about 3.39 million metric‬ tons of carbon dioxide could be captured.

""There's no bigger way to [lower] your carbon score than carbon sequestration. It's a huge stepping stone to be able to accomplish, you know, a very low carbon fuel,"" Walt Wendland, CEO of Onida-based Ringneck Energy, told Argus Leader on Monday.

However, 45Z credits are only available between 2025 and 2027, which would require Summit and Navigator's pipeline to be constructed and operational by then.

Summit Carbon, which plans to run about 477 miles of pipeline through South Dakota, experienced a setback in January, when the state's Public Utilities Commission unanimously voted to move permit hearings on the pipeline from a springtime evidentiary hearing and June 15 decision to a Sept. 11 evidentiary hearing and a Nov. 15 final deadline.

Such delays, Summit Carbon's lawyers acknowledged prior to the January vote, can be ""fatal"" to projects like the company's Midwest Carbon Express pipeline.

""On their own, the 45Q and 45Z tax credits would likely be insufficient to induce largescale CCS adoption by individual plants in the face of prohibitively high CO2 transportation costs,"" the study reads. ""The key to successfully implementing CCS projects in the Midwest ethanol industry are large pipeline networks that lower CO2 transportation costs.""

The average ethanol plant stands to gain about $40 million in 45Z credits and $22 million in 45Q credits in annual revenue between 2025 and 2034. In terms of net value, however, operating expenses and pipeline transportation costs would effectively halve the potential value of the credits.

CO2 pipelines could sustain corn prices for farmers after a rough first year

Farmers, too, can benefit from an improved corn basis, the study posits.

The study makes the assertion the 45Q and 45Z tax credits will increase demand for corn from ethanol producers. To that end, the Dakota Institute devised three scenarios in which ethanol production rises by 10%, 15% and 20%.

Following the 15% expansion scenario, the study says the state's ethanol industry would boost their anticipated output of corn ethanol from about 1.4 billion to 1.67 billion gallons per year.

This would create a demand, the study continues, of about 77 million bushels of corn in the local market and therefore drive up the average corn basis by nearly 19 cents per bushel after five years.

""This is going to help us more closely match up the increase in the yield curve to the demand from ethanol, because we're losing a lot of demand in other sectors,"" Wendland said. ""It seems like Brazil's, you know, taking market away from us. We're not getting along with China. So they'd rather buy it from somebody [else]. So we got to put something in place to be able to balance supply and demand.""

The study continues that this would raise the value of corn production in the state by $123.5 million and up to $938.3 million over the 10-year period.

McEntaffer, who is also CEO of the Dakota Institute, clarified the relative swell to farmers' wallets are fixed on the 2022 South Dakota harvest results and do not take into account certain factors like future harvest yields or long-term climate impacts.

However, the pipelines will have a measured negative effect on crop yields over the next decade, the study notes. In the first year alone, farmland crossed by a pipeline will see 100% yield loss, accounting for more than $10 million in damages to farm producers. Over the 10-year span, affected farmlands will see related yield losses decrease, but an estimated $19.47 million in damages is anticipated.

What's revealed ― and concealed ― about SCS and Navigator's pipelines?

There are some data points that reveal new or little-known information about the proposed pipeline system.

First, the study provides a timeline for Summit Carbon and Navigator pipelines', which are currently in the pre-construction stage. The study indicates the companies plan to begin construction in 2024 but will only become operational by the latter half of 2025. This means they would only be able to take full advantage of the more desirable 45Z credits for 36 months instead of two full years.

As part of the study, Summit Carbon and Navigator shared a ""good faith"" estimate for property tax expenses as part of their combined operating expense budget of $82.8 million. The companies expect to pay nearly $19.7 million in annual property taxes to municipalities once the pipelines are operational. Additionally, electricity costs, accounting for nearly $38.8 million, made up the majority of their operating costs.

Additionally, individual contracts between the two carbon companies and applicable ethanol plants were not shared with the Dakota Institute, obscuring the relationship between the two industries. What this means is that some ethanol plants' capture and pipeline transportation costs, which reduce the potential value of their tax credits, may vary to an unknown degree.

Wendland declined to comment on some of the specifics of Ringneck Energy's relationship with Summit Carbon, but he did say differences in business structures ""are so, so vast between the two companies.""

""I can share that the relationship we have with Summit is a very good relationship. You know, they didn't require capital to help them build the plant,"" Wendland said. ""Summit's been more closely related to the farmer-owned plants and the private plants … where Navigator is more involved with the oil companies and the pipeline companies, so, in general, I've always felt that that Summit's a little more farmer friendly.""

Dakota Institute's report was also unable to determine how many local workers will be employed during the project. The study indicated the CO2 pipelines will support the creation of over 7,000 jobs during the 10-year span. The construction phase in particular, which will take place in 2024 and 2025, will be responsible for supporting 2,772 construction jobs annually.

Aug 10 2022,Hong Kong’s quarantine relaxation won’t revive its economy,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/hong-kong-quarantine-cut-wont-revive-economy-1849394034,"After weeks of rumors and speculation, the Hong Kong government this week finally shortened mandatory hotel quarantines for inbound travellers from seven days to three .

But the city remains as cut-off from the world as ever. Tourists and business travellers are deterred by Hong Kong’s stringent, costly, and often unpredictable quarantine measures.

As a result, Hong Kong’s economy has taken a hit, sliding into a recession last month following two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The outlook is clouded with uncertainty, as zero-covid policies locally and on mainland China continue to weigh on consumer demand and trade.

Hong Kong risks “enduring economic scarring”

The slight easing of quarantine rules “will do little to stimulate the return of tourists and short-term business travellers, who have grown accustomed to the absence of any such restrictions across most jurisdictions,” analysts at the Fitch ratings agency wrote in a note yesterday (Aug. 9).



“We expect Hong Kong’s economy to shrink again this year, the third contraction since 2019, heightening the risks of enduring economic scarring,” they added.

Hong Kong faces the added challenge of needing to raise interest rates in line with the US Fed’s tightening, in order to maintain the local currency’s peg with the dollar. Yet it is economic stimulus that the city needs right now, not cooling.

Hong Kong finds itself in a sort of purgatory between China’s “zero covid” approach and a desire to move away from stringent pandemic restrictions, not least because the city is determined to maintain its role as a premier international finance hub.

“As far as I can tell we are looking at measures used by ‘Zero Covid’ locations and ‘living with COVID’ locations and picking some parts and concepts from each,” Benjamin Cowling, chair professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in a tweet this week. “Explanation of policies tends more towards the former, while the actual aim tends more towards the latter.”

The difficult balancing act between the two pandemic approaches sometimes results in illogical policies. For example, there continues to be a ban on public gatherings of groups larger than four–even if they are fully masked, regardless of whether they’re meeting indoors or outdoors–but diners can eat together in tables of eight and banquets can host up to 120 people.

Though Hong Kong’s shortened quarantine may be a welcome carrot, it also comes with a stick: mainland China-style health codes, which will be used to temporarily restrict the movement of new arrivals following their quarantine. The technology is yet another tool enhancing the government’s ability to track citizens’ whereabouts, and also opens up the potential for abuse.

Hong Kong is in for more economic gloom, with an added dose of heightened state surveillance.

This post has been updated to clarify the latest mandated length of quarantine.

Jul 28 2022,"Economy in recession range, with GDP contracting 0.9% in second quarter",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-falls-second-quarter-indicating-recession,"America’s GDP fell at a 0.9% annualized rate in the second quarter, a preliminary estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Thursday morning.

The report marks the second straight quarter of declining inflation-adjusted GDP — a situation commonly used to define a recession. GDP tumbled at a 1.6% rate in the first quarter.

WHITE HOUSE CHALLENGES COMMON DEFINITION OF A RECESSION — HERE’S WHAT TO KNOW

Thursday’s numbers indicate that the economy has been struggling to stay above water during the historic monetary policy tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve, which is trying to lower soaring inflation. Residential investment cratered, a sign of the housing market slowing as mortgage rates rise. Consumer spending on goods also turned negative.

“We doubt the economy is in a recession given the labor market strength. But the reported softening in domestic demand confirms the economy is rapidly downshifting amid stubbornly-high inflation and aggressive Fed tightening,” said economists with Oxford Economics. “The economy is battling headwinds of high inflation, aggressive Fed tightening, financial market volatility, and weakening global demand.”

While the coronavirus pandemic was the biggest factor in GDP growth over the past couple of years, the bigger problem facing the economy now is inflation and the Fed’s plan to tamp it down by raising interest rates.

The Biden administration had been working to preempt the Thursday report, fearing it would turn out to be in the red. The White House released a blog post asserting that two consecutive quarters of negative growth doesn’t necessarily indicate the country is in a recession.

Government officials, economists, and many others use recession designations provided by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private academic group. The bureau doesn’t provide a concrete definition. Rather, it relies on the judgment of a group of economists.

The group broadly defines a recession as “a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.”

Republicans blamed Biden Thursday morning for causing a recession.

“Democrats can’t solve the massive economic challenges our nation is facing because they won’t even admit there’s a problem to begin with,” said Calvin Moore, the communications director for the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that backs House Republicans. “Families need relief, but Democrats’ only solution is doubling down on the same failed policies that got us here in the first place.”

Since last summer, inflation has accelerated to crippling levels not seen in 40 years. Inflation, as gauged by the consumer price index, clocked in at a blistering 9.1% in the 12 months ending in June — a number that was higher than expected.

On Wednesday, following a two-day meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would increase its interest rate target by three-quarters of a percentage point. The central bank typically raises rates by just a quarter of a percentage point, so the move was akin to three simultaneous rate hikes and speaks to the desperation of officials who want to bring prices down.

One positive aspect of the economy, which has provided a cushion for the Fed’s tightening, is the strong labor market.

The economy beat expectations and added 372,000 jobs in June, more than was expected. The unemployment rate also remained at 3.6% in June, matching the low level it was at right before the pandemic struck.

A day before the new GDP numbers were released, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he doesn’t believe the economy of the United States is in a recession.

“I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession,” Powell told reporters Wednesday. “And the reason is there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well.”

Powell pointed to the tight labor market as one factor in his argument. He said that while it is evident that growth is slowing, the jobs market has remained robust."
Mar 10 2023,"Economy again beats expectations with 311,000 jobs in February, unemployment rises to 3.6%",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-again-beats-expectations-with-311-000-jobs-in-february-unemployment-rises-to-3-6,"

The economy gained 311,000 jobs in February, more than expected, in another sign that the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have not substantially harmed the strong labor market.

The new figures reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday morning provide reassurance about the strength of the economy. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.6%, which is a low figure by historical standards, as more people entered the labor force.

The stronger jobs report shows that the central bank’s rate hikes aren’t yet having the punch officials want, and it could cause the Fed to lean toward a more aggressive monetary stance at its meeting later this month.

“It’s stronger than expected, although, on a positive note, the unemployment rate edged up … which places the Fed in somewhat of a quandary — what to do next,” Brian Marks, the executive director of the University of New Haven’s Entrepreneurship and Innovation Program, told the Washington Examiner after the report was released.

The reading follows several months of large job gains and the lowest unemployment rates since the 1960s, which have represented key positive economic data that President Joe Biden has touted even as historic inflation cuts deeply into the paychecks of consumers across the country.

BIDEN PROPOSES NEARLY $7 TRILLION TAX-AND-SPEND BUDGET THAT WOULD NOT STABILIZE THE DEBT

The labor market recovery has so far absorbed hits without slowing down, such as mass layoffs in the tech industry and a sudden, sharp downturn in the housing market.

Friday’s report showed strong employment growth at restaurants and bars, as well as in the retail sector. Construction companies also added to their payrolls, showing that the abrupt downturn in housing has yet to filter through to actual job losses.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during congressional testimony this week that hot inflation reports and persistent strong jobs growth could cause rates to go higher and stay there for longer.

Inflation rose in January to a 5.4% annual rate, according to the personal consumption expenditures index, which is the gauge favored by the Fed.

Powell said the information “suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates is likely to be higher than previously anticipated. If the totality of the data were to indicate that faster tightening is warranted, we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes.”

“Restoring price stability will likely require that we maintain a restrictive stance of monetary policy for some time,” he added.

After he spoke, the odds of a larger Fed rate hike of half of a percentage point rose above 60%, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, which calculates the probability using futures contract prices for rates in the short-term market targeted by the Fed.

Jul 28 2022,Joe Biden: Shrinking GDP ‘Consistent’ With ‘Transition’ To Stable Economy,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/joe-biden-shrinking-gdp-consistent-with-transition-to-stable-economy,"President Joe Biden claimed that Thursday’s economic data showing the U.S. has entered a recession is “consistent with the transition to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation.”

The Biden administration has downplayed the poor economic news as signaling an economic transition out of a fast-paced, post-pandemic recovery to a more stable environment. The White House’s claims come as Americans continue to be battered by inflation, which measured over 9% in June.

On Thursday morning, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released data showing that the U.S. economy shrank for the second straight quarter, satisfying the traditional requirement of a recession. Biden addressed the somber economic news in remarks opening a round table with business leaders and top administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

“It’s important to start with what we know before this morning’s report. Our jobs market remains historically strong. Our economy created more than 9 million jobs since I came to office,” Biden said. “Our economy created more than one million jobs in the second quarter, the same period as today’s GDP report covers. Our unemployment rate is 3.6%, near a record historic low.”

“Households and businesses, the engines of our economy, continue to move forward,” he added. The president then touted a recent White House visit by the chairman of SK Group, a South Korea-based telecoms company, in which the company announced a $22 billion investment in its United States operations.

“Now, there is no doubt we expect growth to be slower than last year rather than the rapid clip we had,” Biden continued. “But that’s consistent with the transition to a stable, steady growth and lower inflation. There is going to be a lot of chatter today on Wall Street and among pundits about whether we are in a recession, but if you look at our job market, consumer spending, business investment, we see signs of economic progress in the second quarter as well.”

Earlier Thursday, in remarks delivered at the White House, Biden played up labor statistics and the SK Group investment and said “that doesn’t sound like a recession to me” before exiting the podium.

Thursday’s Bureau of Economic Analysis report fulfilled the traditional signal that the U.S. economy has entered a recession. The Biden administration has claimed recently that two straight quarters of negative GDP growth do not necessarily mean the U.S. is in recession, however."

The national unemployment rate is still at 3.6%, its lowest level since 1969, but Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Department of Labor offered signs of weakness in the American economy as the presidential race gets underway.

The economy added just 75,000 jobs in May, bringing average job growth over the past three months to 151,000 ― down from 216,000 this time last year. And while worker wages continued to grow, the pace slowed, rising at a 3.1% rate, down from a peak of 3.4% in February.

Most economists believe a low unemployment rate puts upward pressure on wages: With fewer desperate workers willing to take low-paying jobs, businesses are forced to offer higher pay to keep and attract talent.

“While the slower job growth reported for May is discouraging, probably the most disconcerting aspect of the report is the evidence that wage growth is actually slowing in spite of the 3.6 percent unemployment rate,” said Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in his review of the data.

The numbers prompted an uncharacteristically bleak statement from Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas), the top Republican on the House tax committee.

“These numbers are less than hoped for but not surprising given the uncertainty over global trade tensions and a dysfunctional Congress led by Democrats obsessed with investigations, impeachment, and raising taxes rather than working with Republicans to solve America’s challenges,” Brady said.

Predictions of economic doom have followed every major economic policy decision from President Donald Trump, from his bankers-and-brokers-first tax cuts to his chaotic tariff program. But while none of Trump’s top-line economic initiatives have accomplished much for working people, they have also not disrupted the economy enough to throw growth off track. Back in 2017, most economists considered the American economy to be at full employment ― meaning it could not create more jobs without fueling inflation. Instead, millions of jobs have been created without a substantive increase in prices.

But the economy won’t just keep roaring ahead on its own forever. As of this month, the recovery from the Great Recession, which ended in June 2009, is tied for the longest on record. Some economists fear it could run out of gas in the next year.

What happens next could be up to the Federal Reserve.

The Fed regulates overall employment and inflation in the American economy by adjusting interest rates ― the price of loans for consumers and businesses. Raising rates typically slows down the economy by making it more expensive for consumers and businesses to take out loans and spend money to grow the economy. By making it cheaper to borrow money, lowering rates can help grow the economy. But growth can also fuel inflation, as higher wages increase worker purchasing power.

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed has kept rates relatively low, including a nine-year stretch in which rates were effectively zero. But since the beginning of 2016, officials at the central bank have been eager to raise interest rates ― in part because they are simply accustomed to operating with higher interest rates, and in part because many want to have room to cut rates if the economy slows down. With both job and wage growth slowing down, many economists hope the Fed will cut rates at its next meeting in June.

The political stakes are high. The strong economy has been one of Trump’s favorite talking points throughout his presidency. Conventional wisdom in Washington holds that voters are more willing to ignore Trump’s constant scandals and abuses of power as long as the economy is in decent shape.

“You can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history,” Trump tweeted last month.

All he needs is a little help from the Fed. To that end, the president has shown he’ll use bullying to get the kind of monetary policy he wants.

“The only problem our economy has is the Fed,” he tweeted in December during a stock market swoon. “They don’t have a feel for the Market, they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!”

Since the late 1970s, the Fed has adhered to a policy of strict “independence” from the executive branch. Economic policymaking is much easier to do when the central bank coordinates with Congress and the administration, as it did for much of the 20th century. But much of the economic and legal professions have come to believe that economic management should not be subject to the short-term pressures and passions of a president eyeing the next election.

As a result, many within the Fed are eager to assert their independence from Trump by bucking his oft-repeated demand for low interest rates. Trump shot himself in the foot by replacing Fed Chair Janet Yellen ― an Obama appointee fond of low rates ― with Jerome Powell, a Republican who professed a desire to raise rates prior to his confirmation. But Powell also does not want to cause a recession by being excessively stingy.

In remarks this week, Powell said he had his eye on trade negotiations and wobbly economic data. “We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion,” he said."
Jul 26 2022,Why Americans keep splurging even as they turn sour on the economy,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/why-americans-keep-splurging-even-as-they-turn-sour-on-1849333075,"US consumer confidence data for July, which was released Tuesday, showed a third straight month of decline. The Conference Board, which runs the monthly surveys, reiterated that it expects strong headwinds for consumer spending in the next six months, echoing what analysts have been saying since the start of the year—that people are going to tighten their belts.

However, consumers have yet to actually do so. US retail sales increased 1% in June, the latest figures available, with nine out of the 13 tracked retail categories increasing last month.

And while there’s talk of an impending recession, the typical behaviors that mark a weakening economy are not showing up yet. People usually shift by cutting down on durable goods and travel. But this summer is one of the first opportunities many people have had to travel since the beginning of the pandemic, and spending on this category is as its highest since the onset of covid-19, even with airfares and hotel prices surging; the same goes for eating out with restaurants and live events, spurring increased spending.

A majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck—or are they?

A report last month said that 58% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, including a third of those earning $250,000 or more. But the claims may be overstated, according to an analysis by Bank of America, and Americans have more of a financial cushion than these numbers indicate.

“Paycheck to paycheck has this subsistence level kind of feel to it,” said David Tinsley, a Bank of America Institute senior economist, who examined the aggregate data of nearly 67 million Bank of America clients. While people may be using up all their cash at the end of every pay cycle, a lot of that is spent on discretionary items, in other words expenses that are not housing, utilities, food, or gasoline.

In reality, Bank of America found that the share of people who were stretched financially—that is, had outflows that exceeded their inflows—in the first quarter of this year sat at roughly 20% across all income bands from low to high.

If it seems mystifying why high earners are burning through so much cash, Tinsley says it’s because as a demographic they tend to have greater financial commitments. They may have taken on a very large mortgage or pay for private school tuition for their children. A change in lifestyle would not be painless, but if push comes to shove, a family would be able to adjust.

But even those at the lowest tier of earnings as an average are more resilient than two years ago, the bank said. Savings are up around 8% overall compared to pre-pandemic, thanks to stimulus checks and reduced spending on socializing and going out through lockdown.

Rising credit card usage not necessarily a bad sign

The bank’s findings could also help allay fears over credit cards. In May, US credit card balances jumped $71 billion year over year to $841 billion in the first quarter, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said. This led to talk that consumers were relying on credit cards to finance their spending, but Bank of America said the usage is driven primarily by higher-income households as they re-engage in services spending to reap credit card rewards, not because of financial difficulties.

The American job market is still strong

So what explains the gap between how people feel and what they actually do?

“The falling consumer confidence is mostly over inflation and that’s really unusual,” Tinsley said. “Confidence usually falls because people are worried ultimately about their jobs. Sentiment around the labor market hasn’t deteriorated much at all and because of that, they’re able to keep spending right now. At the lower end, workers in leisure and hospitality have been getting some 10% plus wage growth right now. There’s not a lot of hard evidence of that on the wane.”"

Jul 15 2022,China's economy records slowest growth since the start of 2020,CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/economy/china-q2-gdp-2022-intl-hnk/index.html,"Hong Kong CNN Business —

China’s economy has recorded its worst quarterly performance in over two years, after months of harsh Covid lockdowns wreaked havoc across the country.

Gross domestic product in the world’s second largest economy expanded by just 0.4% in the three months to June 30, compared with the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday.

That was sharply lower than the 4.8% increase it registered in the previous quarter and far below the 1% growth estimated by economists in a Reuters poll. On a quarterly basis, GDP shrank 2.6%.

It was the weakest performance since the first quarter of 2020, when China’s economy came to a near standstill as it battled to contain the initial coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan. In that quarter, GDP contracted 6.8%.

For the first half of this year, the economy expanded 2.5%, way below the 5.5% annual target set by the government. Beijing admitted Friday that reaching its GDP goals this year would be hard.

“There are challenges to achieve our expected economic growth target for the whole year,” said Fu Linghui, a spokesperson for the NBS, at a press conference in Beijing. But he expected the economy to rebound in the second half.

Mounting challenges

Chinese policymakers face mounting challenges to keep growth steady, as the country contends with a sharp slowdown in activity due to Beijing’s stringent zero-Covid policy, a bruising regulatory crackdown on the private sector, and a real estate crisis that is causing rising bad debts at banks and growing social protests.

Since March, Beijing’s uncompromising attitude to stamping out the virus led to months of lockdowns in dozens of cities across the country, including Shanghai, the nation’s financial and shipping hub. Millions of residents were confined to their homes, shops and restaurants were closed, and factories were shut, hammering consumer activity and disrupting supply chains.

Authorities began reopening the economy at the start of last month, lifting restrictions in some key cities. The manufacturing and services industries have shown signs of improvement in recent weeks. But Beijing’s adherence to the zero-Covid stance has caused huge uncertainty for businesses and dampened investor sentiment. Consumer spending remains weak, while the job market is under significant pressure — youth unemployment hit a new record high of 19.3% in June.

In the press conference on Friday, Fu said that the economy has taken an “unexpected, severe” hit from domestic and external factors.

Higher global commodity prices, especially food and energy prices, have added to imported inflation. Growing stagflation risks around the world also threaten China’s economic stability, Fu said.

The poor performance in the second quarter “reflected the significant shocks from the Omicron outbreak and corresponding stringent measures adopted in major cities,” said Chaoping Zhu, Shanghai-based global market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management.

“Looking forward, we expect to see continued economic recovery in the second half of this year, mainly supported by government-led infrastructure investment,” he said, adding that if the government eases Covid restrictions further, consumer confidence could bounce back at a faster pace.

But the property sector may still pose a downside risk to growth, Zhu said.

Larry Hu, chief China economist for Macquarie Group, said latest data imply that GDP growth has to accelerate to more than 7% in the second half to deliver annual growth of 5% for the whole year.

“It is impossible without a significant escalation of policy stimulus from the current level,” he said.

Property slump drags

There were some bright spot in Friday’s economic data.

Mining and manufacturing recorded growth of 0.9%, compared with the second quarter last year. And retail sales in June grew 3.1% from a year ago, helped by a jump in car sales boosted by pent-up demand and policy support on electric vehicles. Industrial production also rebounded in June, up 3.9% from a year ago.

But the vast real estate sector remains a major drag.

Property investment dropped 9.4% in June from a year ago, after falling 7.8% in May, according to Macquarie Capital calculations based on government data. Property sales by floor areas decreased 18% last month, following a 32% plunge in May.

“Plunging sales means that developers are facing a liquidity crunch,” Hu said.

“The property woe is causing rising social instability, evidenced by the recent mortgage boycott,” he added.

Over the last few days, desperate homebuyers across dozens of cities have refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes. The payment boycott comes as a growing number of projects have been delayed or stalled by a cash crunch that saw giant developer Evergrande default on its debt last year and several other companies seek protection from creditors.

Zhu from JP Morgan Asset management said that the increasing number of unfinished homes pose a big risk to banks’ financial health.

“Decisive and effective regulatory measures must be taken to prevent the mortgage boycott from developing into a systemic risk,” he said."

Jul 13 2022,"US inflation surges again in June, raising risks for economy",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/inflation-economy-prices-consumer-74e1a5c9bced40460e4079f62e980095,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. inflation surged to a new four-decade high in June because of rising prices for gas, food and rent, squeezing household budgets and pressuring the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively -- trends that raise the risk of a recession.

The government’s consumer price index soared 9.1% over the past year, the biggest yearly increase since 1981, with nearly half of the increase due to higher energy costs.

Lower-income and Black and Hispanic American have been hit especially hard, since a disproportionate share of their income goes toward essentials such as transportation, housing and food. But with the cost of many goods and services rising faster than average incomes, a vast majority of Americans are feeling the pinch in their daily routines.

For 72-year-old Marcia Freeman, who is retired and lives off of a pension, there is no escape from rising expenses.

“Everything goes up, including cheaper items like store brands,” said Freeman, who visited a food bank near Atlanta this week to try and gain control of her grocery costs. Grocery prices have jumped 12% in the past year, the steepest climb since 1979.

Accelerating inflation is a vexing problem for the Federal Reserve, too. The Fed is already engaged in the fastest series of interest rate hikes in three decades, which it hopes will cool inflation by tamping down borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses.

The U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year, and many analysts believe the trend continued in the second quarter.

“The Fed’s rate hikes are doing what they are supposed to do, which is kill off demand,” said Megan Greene, global chief economist at the Kroll Institute. “The trick is if they kill off too much and we get a recession.”

The likelihood of larger rate hikes this year pushed stock indexes lower in afternoon trading. The central bank is expected to raise its key short-term rate later this month by a hefty three-quarters of a point, as it did last month.

As consumers’ confidence in the economy declines, so have President Joe Biden’s approval ratings, posing a major political threat to Democrats in the November congressional elections. Forty percent of adults said in a June AP-NORC poll that they thought tackling inflation should be a top government priority this year, up from just 14% who said so in December.

After years of low prices, a swift rebound from the 2020 pandemic recession — combined with supply-chain snags — ignited inflation.

Consumers unleashed a wave of pent-up spending, spurred by vast federal aid, ultra-low borrowing costs and savings they had built up while hunkering down. As home-bound Americans spent heavily on furniture, appliances and exercise equipment, factories and shipping companies struggled to keep up

In recent months, as COVID fears have receded, consumer spending has gradually shifted away from goods and toward services. Yet rather than pulling down inflation by reducing goods prices, the cost of furniture, cars, and other items has kept rising, while restaurant costs, rents and other services are also getting more expensive.

The year-over-year leap in consumer prices last month followed an 8.6% annual jump in May. From May to June, prices rose 1.3%, following a 1% increase from April to May.

Some economists believe inflation might be reaching a short-term peak. Gas prices, for example, have fallen from the eye-watering $5 a gallon reached in mid-June to an average of $4.63 nationwide Wednesday — still far higher than a year ago.

Shipping costs and commodity prices have also begun to fall, and pay increases have slowed. Surveys show that Americans’ expectations for inflation over the long run have eased — a trend that often points to more moderate price increases over time.

“While today’s headline inflation reading is unacceptably high, it is also out-of-date,” President Biden said Wednesday. “All major economies are battling this COVID-related challenge.”

The latest disappointing data on inflation came out at the outset of Biden’s trip to the Middle East, where he will meet with officials from Saudi Arabia to discuss oil prices, among other subjects.

Republican members of Congress have blamed the higher prices on Biden’s economic policies, specifically his $1.9 trillion financial support package approved in March.

There have been signs that inflation was slowing before — last summer, and in April of this year — only for it to surge again in subsequent months.

“There may be some relief in the July numbers — commodity prices have come off the boil, at least — but we are a very, very long way from inflation normalizing, and there is no tangible sign of downward momentum,” said Eric Winograd, an economist at asset manager AllianceBernstein.

For now, the relentless pace of price increases is frustrating many Americans.

Delores Bledsoe, a truck driver hauling freight from Carlisle, Pennsylvania to Wisconsin on Wednesday, said her fuel costs have tripled. “It’s making me want to get out of the truck and go drive an Uber,” said Bledsoe, who lives in Houston. “It’s depressing.”

Some people are placing blame on companies for using inflation as a cover to raise prices beyond the amount they need to cover their own higher costs.

“I feel the inflation pain every day,” Susana Hazard said this week outside a grocery store in New York City. “Every day, everything is going up and up, more than inflation — they’re price-adjusting. Because even if inflation doesn’t happen, they’ve raised the prices.”

Most economists say corporate price gouging is, at most, one of many causes of runaway inflation and not the primary one.

Housing and rental costs are rising steadily as solid job gains encourage more Americans to move out on their own. Rents have risen 5.8% compared with a year ago, the most since 1986. And the cost of decorating homes is still increasing at a rapid pace — furniture prices are up 13% from a year ago — even as retailers such as Walmart and Target experience rising inventories, which should help lower prices.

The biggest shock has been energy prices, which soared 7.5% just from May to June. Gas prices have skyrocketed nearly 60% compared with a year ago.

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices rose 0.7% from May to June, the biggest such spike in a year. Core prices jumped 5.9% from a year ago.

Inflation is surging well beyond the United States, with 71 million people pushed into poverty in the three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the U.N. Development Program said last week.

The war’s economic damage has been especially severe in Europe, with its reliance on Russian oil and natural gas squeezing businesses and consumers with sharply higher bills for utilities, groceries, gasoline and more. Inflation reached decades-high levels of 8.6% last month in the 19 countries that use the euro currency and 9.1% in the United Kingdom in May.

Jul 13 2022,Inflation Is the Five-Alarm Fire Burning Down the American Economy,Jim Geraghty,right,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/inflation-is-the-five-alarm-fire-burning-down-the-american-economy/,
Jul 08 2022,"The economy added 372,000 jobs in June, outpacing expectations",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/08/economy/june-jobs-report-final/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN Business —

The US economy added 372,000 jobs in June, an unexpected boost in hiring and a signal that the labor market remains robust despite recession fears, according to the monthly jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday.

The unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%, still close to the 52-year low last reached in the months before the pandemic hit.

The June job total, slightly down from May’s revised 384,000 jobs added, far surpassed expectations. Economists polled by Refinitiv projected 272,700 jobs would be added in June, amid a period of economic unease and growing fears that a recession is brewing.

The strongest job gains for June came from the professional and business services, leisure and hospitality and health care industries, with notable increases in areas such as food services and warehousing and storage.

President Joe Biden praised the latest jobs numbers in remarks at the White House on Friday, saying, “Here’s why it’s important: Our private sector has now recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic and added jobs on top of that.”

The President acknowledged the ongoing challenges of inflation, but he also argued that the jobs numbers indicate that his economic plan is working.

“I know times are tough. Prices are too high. Families are facing a cost of living crunch. But today’s economic news confirms the fact that my economic plan is moving this country in a better direction,” Biden said.

Private-sector employment is now above its February 2020 level by 140,000 jobs. However, government employment continues to lag by 664,000, putting the overall labor market at 524,000 jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level.

Momentum remains

The labor market has remained a source of strength for the economy. The latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data released earlier this week showed there were 11.3 million available jobs in May, or 1.9 positions for every job seeker, along with historically low levels of layoffs.

Wages in June were still on the rise, but continue to be outpaced by the highest inflation in 40 years. Average hourly earnings were up 5.1% during the past 12 months. The labor force participation rate, at 62.2%, changed little from the previous month but remains below the pre-pandemic level of 63.4%.

“The job market is still plowing forward even in the face of increasing headwinds and recession fears,” Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor senior economist, said in a statement. “Even if the economy is slowing, the labor market remains a point of strength for the recovery. Strong employer demand is supporting solid but slowing job gains.”

Rapidly rising prices have the Federal Reserve in the throes of a campaign of successive rate hikes in order to cool the economy. Following the central bank’s June rate hike of 75 basis points – the largest such increase since 1994 – Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled another hefty increase of either 50 or 75 basis points at its next meeting on July 26-27.

The robust June employment report likely won’t deter the Fed from its stated path, said John Leer, chief economist for Morning Consult.

“They clearly communicated the intent to frontload rate hikes and then wait to see how those rate hikes were affecting the economy, and I would guess that they will continue along that path, which is to continue to be pretty aggressive,” Leer said in an interview with CNN Business. “In addition to looking at the hard data, they’re also very concerned about maintaining credibility with financial markets, with consumers. When they say they are here to maintain price stability, they really need the American public to believe them on that front, and financial markets in particular.”

Next week’s slate of key economic reports – the latest Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, retail sales and consumer sentiment data – will be critical in getting a gauge on the economy’s health as well as on the influence of the Fed’s actions, he added.

But if the Fed is too aggressive, that could potentially backfire, noted Josh Bivens, director of economic research at the Economic Policy Institute.

“It’s still a tight labor market, it does not seem to me to be an accelerating, heating-up labor market; in fact, it shows some signs of cooling,” Bivens said. “I think the narrative that this is just spiraling out of control and the Fed really needs to rein in things, it doesn’t seem consistent with the last couple of months of data.”

The softening of wage growth and continued march downward of monthly job gains are among the measures showing that the labor market has more than plateaued, he said.

“Given that the primary reason why the Fed tends to raise rates to slow inflation operates through the labor market and wage pressure, that job is mostly done, so I’m not sure what further aggressive rate hikes are really going to do beyond this,” he said.

The pandemic continues to weigh on workers

The pandemic prevented more Americans from re-entering the job market in June, which saw an increase in Covid-19 cases from May.

Among those out of the labor force, some 610,000 people could not look for work in June because of the pandemic, up from 455,000 in the previous month. It’s the first increase in this measure since the Omicron variant swept the nation in January.

The most recent Household Pulse Survey from the Census Bureau also showed that the pandemic took more of a toll on Americans’ ability to work in June. Nearly 3.7 million people said they were not working because they were sick with Covid symptoms or were caring for someone who was sick, according to the survey, taken in the first two weeks of June.

This figure was 3.1 million in the prior survey, taken between late April and early May.

“There are indications that Covid, specifically the most recent Omicron variant wave, did disrupt work in some ways in that you can see the share of people who are employed but out sick,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, citing data from the household survey, which is one of two surveys flowing into the monthly BLS jobs report. “The share of employed people who are out sick in June 2022 not only was elevated compared to where it was pre-pandemic, it’s actually slightly above what we saw in June 2020.”

But what’s different this time around from two years ago, he said, is that people aren’t being kept out of the labor market because of Covid.

“It does look like there’s still a direct impact of Covid on the labor market,” he said, “but it shows up perhaps more now in terms of people getting it, being out sick for a week and then returning to work [as opposed to] people sitting on the sidelines of the labor market.”

Ishara S. Kodikara | Afp | Getty Images

The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday released its weakest global growth expectations for the medium term in more than 30 years. The Washington, D.C.-based institution said that five years from now, global growth is expected to be around 3% — the lowest medium-term forecast in an IMF World Economic Outlook report since 1990. ""The world economy is not currently expected to return over the medium term to the rates of growth that prevailed before the pandemic,"" the fund said in its latest economic outlook. The weaker growth prospects stem from the progress economies like China and South Korea have made in increasing their living standards, the IMF said, as well as slower global labor force growth and geopolitical fragmentation, such as Brexit and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

These forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns. IMF

In the short term, however, the IMF expects global growth of 2.8% this year and 3% in 2024, slightly below the fund's estimates published in January. The new estimates are a cut of 0.1 percentage point for both this year and next. ""The anemic outlook reflects the tight policy stances needed to bring down inflation, the fallout from the recent deterioration in financial conditions, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and growing geoeconomic fragmentation,"" the IMF said in the same report. Looking at some of the regional breakdowns, the IMF sees the United States economy expanding by 1.6% this year and the euro zone growing by 0.8%. However, the United Kingdom is seen contracting by 0.3%. China's GDP is expected to increase by 5.2% in 2023, according to the IMF, and India's by 5.9%. The Russian economy — which contracted by more than 2% in 2022 — is seen growing by 0.7% this year. ""The major forces that affected the world in 2022 — central banks' tight monetary stances to allay inflation, limited fiscal buffers to absorb shocks amid historically high debt levels, commodity price spikes and geoeconomic fragmentation with Russia's war in Ukraine, and China's economic reopening—seem likely to continue into 2023. But these forces are now overlaid by and interacting with new financial stability concerns,"" the IMF warned.

Banking turmoil

The IMF said that its baseline forecast ""assumes that the recent financial sector stresses are contained."" It comes after a number of banks failed in March, causing volatility across global markets. Silvergate Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank all collapsed, with regulators taking action in an effort to prevent contagion. Since then, First Republic Bank has also received support from other lenders, and in Switzerland, authorities asked UBS to step in and acquire its struggling rival Credit Suisse. The pressures in the banking sector have dissipated in recent weeks, but they have made the overall economic picture worse in the eyes of the IMF.

May 15 2023,Congestion pricing will hurt Downtown’s economy: Chinatown and other neighborhoods will suffer if there is a new fee placed on cars,New York Daily News,left,https://nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-congestion-pricing-will-hurt-downtowns-economy-20230515-bdccxgsjazfcpcbzi37uabepzm-story.html,"Now that the Biden administration has given the green light to begin the final review of congestion pricing plans, it is time once again to say slow down before adopting an inequitable plan that will fall most heavily on those least able to afford it, and threaten tourist dependent areas like Lower Manhattan’s Chinatown still struggling to recover from the economic devastation of 9/11, Hurricane Sandy and the pandemic.

Chinatown is a vital part of the city’s cultural fabric and has been a destination for tourists and locals for decades. In recent years, competition from Chinatowns in other boroughs has increased, making it important to protect remaining businesses in Manhattan’s Chinatown. Congestion pricing would impose a fee on drivers coming into the city from the suburbs or other boroughs, making that recovery all the harder.

New Years Eve decorations on Mott Street, Chinatown, Manhattan, New York, Saturday, January 2, 2021.

I deeply respect the motivations of supporters of congestion pricing, who have fought so hard to ameliorate automobile pollution, though neighborhoods outside the Central Business District north of 61st St. would likely see increased pollution from traffic looking to avoid the fee.

But I am surprised that many of the so-called progressives who support congestion pricing don’t seem at all concerned about using price — currently proposed somewhere between $9 and $23 in peak hours depending on how many exemptions are finally approved — as a means of social control.

The cost will fall most heavily on those least able to pay, whether they live outside the zone and drive in for medical appointments, or are low-income residents within the zone, including senior citizens who have aged in place and whose children have moved to other boroughs and beyond and would be dissuaded from visiting.

Many senior citizens in neighborhoods designated as NORCs, or Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities, along Grand St. and elsewhere have limited access to subways, exacerbating the problem.

Especially in tourist-dependent neighborhoods like Chinatown, predominantly low-wage employees — whether essential workers in health care, or restaurant workers — do not work nine-to-five shifts when mass transit is more convenient. Those workers, many pushed by skyrocketing rents to seek housing in the far reaches of outer boroughs or beyond, do not have the flexibility for remote or hybrid schedules.

Even a lower off-peak congestion fee, projected between $7 and $17 again depending on exemptions, is a serious burden.

While supporters point to congestion pricing schemes overseas, it is worth noting that the pricing plan in London drastically lowered the number of private vehicles entering downtown, but the number of for-hire vehicles rose so dramatically to pick up the slack that bus speeds are little changed from what they were before the plan went into effect almost two decades ago. We could expect to see a similar increase in for-hire vehicles — yellow cabs, Uber of Lyft, or black cars — on Lower Manhattan streets.

The other predicate for congestion pricing, or course, is that revenue from the fee would generate up to $1 billion a year to support the MTA’s underfunded capital budget.

Congestion pricing is the most recent iteration of plans to limit auto traffic in Lower Manhattan dating back to the beginning of the 20th century, with many plans focused on tolling the three East River crossings into Lower Manhattan, all of which died after intense objections from Brooklyn and Queens residents.

Those objections are echoed today in opposition to congestion pricing from elected officials in Staten Island and the Bronx in particular, who argue the plan would simply shift the impacts of auto-generated pollution to those boroughs.

The most recent example of an attempt to provide a new funding stream to the MTA was a proposal by Gov. Hochul to impose a small increase in payroll taxes in suburban counties utilizing Metro-North or the Long Island Rail Road, but that too fell victim to haggling in Albany, as did a commuter tax that was eliminated decades ago in a misguided attempt to protect a Democratic legislative candidate who lost that election.

My primary concern, of course, is Lower Manhattan and Chinatown, where I hope to become the next city councilmember. Limiting the number of visitors through a costly pricing mechanism will damage the small and mid-size businesses that anchor the neighborhood and employ thousands of workers.

I am ready to roll up my sleeves and work with all stakeholders to find a way to raise funds for the MTA, lower pollution levels in Manhattan and beyond, and protect the small business community that is a lifeline for neighborhoods such as mine.

Congestion pricing is not that plan. Let’s go to work and find what is.

Oct 13 2022,Pastors Reveal Troubled US Economy Is Having Negative Impact on Churches,CBN,right,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2022/october/pastors-reveal-troubled-us-economy-is-having-negative-impact-on-churches,"While some churches across the country are shaking off the financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a new survey of pastors reveals the troubled economy is now having an adverse financial effect on their churches as well.

A Lifeway Research study of U.S. Protestant pastors found that 52% say the current economy is having a negative impact on their ability to operate. For 40%, the economic circumstances aren't having any effect. Fewer than 1 in 10 pastors (7%) say the current economy is a positive factor for their churches.

The study noted the economic outlook among the pastors has grown more worrisome this year than in recent years. Just last year, around half of the pastors polled (49%) said the economy was having no impact.

""2022 marks the first time since 2016 that more than half of pastors feel the economy is having a negative impact on their churches and the first time since 2012 that fewer than 10% of pastors see the economy as having a positive effect,"" Aaron Earls, a senior writer at Lifeway wrote.

""Outside economic forces are back to being a negative influence for most churches, according to their pastors,"" said Scott McConnell, executive director of Lifeway Research. ""As temporary assistance from the CARES Act expires and prices and interest rates rise, churches are noticing the impact on their finances.""

Despite their negative financial outlook, most pastors report their congregations have continued to give regularly.

""Around 7 in 10 U.S. Protestant pastors say giving at their church so far this year is at or exceeding their budget, including 46% who say giving has been about what was budgeted and 23% who say it's higher. Close to 3 in 10 (29%) say giving is below their 2022 budget,"" Earls noted.

When compared to 2021, almost 3 out of 4 pastors say their offerings so far in 2022 are at or above 2021 levels, with 42% saying it's the same as last year and 32% saying it's above. For 1 in 4 churches (23%), offerings are below 2021.

But it's the smaller congregations that are being hit hardest by the impact that skyrocketing inflation is having on their members.

""Small church pastors, those with congregations of less than 50 attendees, (61%) are the most likely to say the economy is negatively impacting their churches,"" Earls wrote.

""Churches with attendance of less than 50 have fewer people to cover the expenses of the church,"" said McConnell. ""When prices rise there are fewer people to spread that cost among.""

You can read the entire 16-page Lifeway Research survey results here.

As CBN News reported in September, according to data from Barna's Revisiting the Tithe & Offering, a section in its The State of Generosity series, most pastors don't define giving outside the church as a form of tithing, but a clear majority — 70% — said such giving does not need to be solely financial. And when it comes to monetary giving, only 33% believe the traditionally accepted 10% is proper.

One-in-five pastors (21%) believe the threshold for a proper tithe is simply whether it is sacrificial, while 20% said Christians should just give as much as they are willing to offer.

Some churches have tried to help others in their community face the negative effects of the economy with its rising inflation by doing what churches do best -- outreach.

As CBN News reported in June, as gas prices soared to around $5 per gallon, one church in Louisiana did its part to relieve some of the pain at the pump. The Lone Wa Worship Center in Monroe, Louisiana offered communion, prayer, and $25 worth of free gas to the first 200 drivers who came into the church's parking lot.

And last February, the United Church of Christ (UCC) gave peace of mind to people across the country by paying off more than $100 million in medical debt.

The Cleveland, Ohio-based denomination announced it had canceled $33 million of patient medical debt in the Buckeye State, bringing the total of debt canceled by the church in a two-year period to $104 million.

And in 2021, St. Bede's Episcopal Church in Santa Fe, New Mexico partnered with a medical debt recovery group known as RIP Medical Debt to clear $1,380,120 in medical debt for 782 families who live in New Mexico and parts of Arizona.

The church was able to save $15,000 in order to pay off the debt.

""I don't know if this parish has ever funded a program with such a great impact. We were able to do it because every week we set aside 10% of donations to the church for outreach. Prioritizing service to others is our gospel imperative,"" said Rev. Catherine Volland.

Lifeway Methodology

The phone survey of 1,000 Protestant pastors was conducted Sept. 6-30, 2022, according to Lifeway. The calling list was a stratified random sample, drawn from a list of all Protestant churches. Quotas were used for church size. Each interview was conducted with the senior pastor, minister or priest at the church. Responses were weighted by region and church size to reflect the population more accurately. The completed sample is 1,000 surveys. The sample provides 95% confidence that the sampling error does not exceed plus or minus 3.2%. This margin of error accounts for the effect of weighting. Margins of error are higher in sub-groups.

Oct 14 2022,"In first debate, Healey and Diehl clash over the economy, abortion and Trump",WBUR,center,https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/10/13/geoff-diehl-maura-healey-massachusetts-governor-debate,"Democrat Maura Healey and Republican Geoff Diehl traded jabs Wednesday night in their first debate in the race for Massachusetts governor, sparring over the economy, immigration and abortion rights.

For much of the debate, it felt like a third candidate was on the ballot: Donald Trump. From the start, Healey sought to link Diehl to the former president, who remains deeply unpopular in Massachusetts.

""My opponent has said that he backs Donald Trump 100% of the time,"" Healey said of Diehl, accusing him of running his campaign ""from the Trump playbook"" and of wanting to bring ""Trumpism"" to Massachusetts.

Healey, the state's attorney general who lives in Boston’s South End, repeated the attack more than once, calling Diehl ""extreme,"" ""dangerous"" and ""unqualified to be the next governor.""

Diehl, a former state representative from Whitman, was one of the state's first Republicans to endorse Trump when he ran for president in 2015. He has remained loyal to him ever since, embracing the former president's support in his run to become the state's next governor.

By contrast, Democrat Maura Healey spent much of her tenure as the state's attorney general suing the Trump administration.

But in Wednesday night's debate, Diehl called the Trump references a distraction.

""It’s Halloween time and that’s her boogeyman,” he said.

Diehl presented himself as a fiscal conservative who supports parental rights and law and order, while backing stricter immigration laws. And he sought to tie Healey to high inflation, rising energy prices and President Biden.

""Joe Biden, the person that you supported, is leading us into economic disaster just two years into the job,"" Diehl declared.

Diehl, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts, has pushed the former president's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged. When asked last night if he still believes the election was stolen, he at first appeared to edge away from that unfounded claim.

""Obviously Joe Biden won the election,"" Diehl said, before adding, ""Look at how bad the economy is right now.""

Diehl went on to claim there were irregularities in 2020, and insisted that mail-in voting makes election fraud more likely, even in Massachusetts. And he said a law that gives undocumented immigrants in the state access to driver’s licenses automatically enrolls them to vote. In fact, the law doesn't do that. (Diehl is leading an effort to repeal the law, which will be on the ballot this fall.)

Healey, who backs the law, said it promotes public safety and pointed out that a number of Massachusetts' police chiefs support it as well.

""You want to know who is actually driving on our roads,"" she said. ""You want to know that they've received instruction and training through a driver's ed program.""

But the sharpest clash by far came over abortion. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights, Healey said, ""Massachusetts needs a governor who will protect a woman's freedom to make a decision for herself.""

""I will. He won't. It's as simple as that,"" she said.

While Diehl opposes abortion, he said that as governor, he would respect Massachusetts' Roe Act, which codifies abortion rights in state law. And then he shifted the argument to vaccine mandates, accusing Healey of turning her back on state workers, including police troopers, who lost their jobs for refusing to get vaccinated.

""That's really shameful,"" Diehl said, pledging to respect people’s freedom to decide for themselves whether to get vaccinated. “A lot of people lost jobs.""

Healey shot back that what's shameful is ""all the talk of freedom, except when it applies to women.""

The debate was hosted by NBC10 Boston, Telemundo Boston and NECN.

Polls suggest Diehl is running well behind Healey. It's not clear if he managed to close any of that margin Wednesday night, but he will have have another chance on Oct. 20, when the two debate again."
Jun 21 2022,"The comedown: After stimulus boom, Americans face a darkening economy",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/06/21/inflation-covid-aid-economy/,"DOYLESTOWN, Pa. — Jazmin Johnson never had more than $300 in her bank account. Then came a gusher of federal stimulus funds during the pandemic, and Johnson’s savings swelled, rising to roughly $10,000 one day last spring. But roughly a year later, that boost is almost all gone. On a recent Tuesday morning, the mother of two sat at a food pantry in the Philadelphia suburbs, waiting to pick up free diapers and lamenting that her bank balance now stands at $511. On their last trip to the grocery store, Johnson told her 3-year-old that they could no longer afford his favorite red Hawaiian Punch.

That kind of turnaround is alarming for anyone going through it — and it may be the key to understanding why Americans have turned so sharply on this economy, posing a massive political threat to the Biden administration and Democrats in Congress ahead of this year’s midterm elections. The economy snapped back so quickly from the pandemic that people like Johnson are in a paradox: They’re worse off now, financially, than they were even when covid was a much more severe health threat, the national unemployment rate was almost twice as high, and economic growth was uneven.

By many measures, Johnson has vindicated President Biden’s economic policies. The cash from Biden’s American Rescue Plan stimulus program gave her $4,200 in stimulus checks — for herself and two kids — followed by big increases in food stamp assistance and a significantly larger child tax credit. That helped her go back to school last spring, where she got a degree as a medical assistant. A better job, and higher pay, soon followed, treating dementia patients at a hospital nearby. Despite the recent decline, her savings are still technically larger than at any other point in her life.

But Johnson does not feel like an economic success story. Instead, she has a sense of acute loss for that fleeting period last spring where remarkable new financial opportunities appeared possible. Like the country overall, Johnson has slowly and steadily gotten poorer over the past year. Her expenses have soared due to the fastest inflation in four decades, and the many pandemic-driven government programs that supplemented her income have been eliminated one by one.

“It was a weight lifted like I can’t describe. I could actually buy what I wanted to at the grocery store,” said Johnson, 22. “But now I keep telling my boyfriend that I’m stuck. Living is so much harder now.”

The coronavirus — and attempts to mitigate its severity — severely damaged large sectors of the American economy when it first hit in February 2020, with unemployment spiking as schools and businesses closed their doors over the following month. But despite those severe shocks, the country’s economy emerged from the pandemic not only intact but propelled by a historic boom. Flush with cash from nearly $6 trillion in unprecedented federal stimulus, consumer spending exploded. America created more jobs last year than any other year in the nation’s history. The economy grew by the fastest rate in 38 years.

The only direction to go was down. Compared to almost any other time in modern history, American households still have lots of cash. But compared to last year, they have significantly less — particularly as costs have continued to rise faster than their wages for the last year. This economic comedown now appears poised to quickly get much more intense, with signs of early declines in business growth, consumer spending and hiring as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to curb rapidly rising inflation.

Interviews with more than three dozen people in Bucks County, Pa. — one of most narrowly divided counties in one of the most critical swing states in the 2020 presidential election — turned up a lingering nostalgia for the pandemic economy, as inflation has eroded stimulus savings over the last year. It amounts to an intractable problem for the White House, which cannot bring back the stimulus checks and other relief measures that offered an unprecedented, but temporary, degree of financial stability for millions of people that is fading painfully with every trip to the grocery store and gas station.

“There’s no doubt wealth is much higher now than it was two years ago or in the time before that,” said Jason Furman, who served as a senior economist in the Obama administration and is now a professor at Harvard University. “But people have literally become poorer, by any concept, over the last year. Over the last 12-month period, just about everything has moved in the wrong direction. It should not be a mystery why people are worried.”

‘We can’t eat it all at once and hike everything’

Kitty Ghen, 63, and Nancy Strenger, 62, walked out of 86 West in Doylestown on a balmy Tuesday evening, the longtime friends emerging from the swanky sushi restaurant into a busy downtown strip thrumming with diners and shoppers. The last two years have been good for them: Ghen received a federal grant from the Paycheck Protection Program at the start of the pandemic and later got a separate covid-related business grant from the county. Strenger had enjoyed the rising value of her cryptocurrency investments.

But in a change from their normal routine, Ghen and Strenger each only had one drink at happy hour and headed back to their respective homes for dinner, having decided to cook more to save. Ghen is an acupuncturist and fears the current downturn in the stock market will lead patients to cut out her practice in favor of more essential medical needs. Strenger, who is retired, watched the value of her cryptocurrencies collapse this month.

“I don’t get the food I used to get,” Ghen said. “I'm more careful than ever.”

Strenger added: “The stocks have amazingly been going downhill, and it really put a scare into me.”

With about 630,000 residents, Bucks County is a middle- to upper-income suburb of Philadelphia, and the borough of Doylestown represents its affluent economic core. Covid shut down the city’s downtown much as it affected cities across the country. But, financially, Doylestown and its 8,250 residents rebounded. More than $100 million in small business loans flowed into the city from the stimulus package signed by President Donald Trump in March 2020. Bucks County is receiving $122 million from Biden’s rescue plan, which passed last year.

The county added 600 new businesses from 2020 to 2021, according to federal data. Home values in Doylestown increased by 35 percent, according to Redfin. A new bitcoin ATM opened at the Doylestown Global Gas Station on North Easton Road, as did one at a local Giant. These all mirrored national trends — Americans applied to start 5.4 million small businesses last year, a record that exceeds any other year by 20 percent, and asset prices nationwide were inflated by historically low interest rates intended to spur demand.

“Toward the beginning of covid, we were really well-received; we were doing local deliveries; people were really willing to come out,” said Caitlin Hernandez, 31, owner of Makers Off Main, which sells handcrafted works from a collective of local artists and opened during the pandemic.

But this boom appears to have crested. Small businesses nationally have soured on the economy and are increasingly concerned about their ability to pass on higher costs to their customers. The percentage of small-business owners who expect better conditions fell from April to May for the fifth consecutive month, according to the National Federation of Independent Businesses — notching the worst reading in the 48-year history of the survey.

Discretionary purchases may be the first to go. Hernandez’s art workshops, for instance, had been drawing about 10 people consistently; now, they’re attended by only two or three people, or canceled altogether. “Supporting small businesses is harder when the economy is down and money is tight,” she said.

Many business owners in Bucks County say demand is keeping up for now, but worry that it is at risk if persistent inflation forces them to implement another round of price hikes. Owen Burke, 20, the part-owner of the diner Coach’s, already raised the price of his Philly cheesesteak — called the “Buck” — from $9 to $11.95 in response to the rising costs of ingredients. His supplier just increased his price tag for fries from $30 to $50 for a case of seven bags. Some customers grumbled but most kept buying, though Burke is now worried they’ll revolt if he raises prices again.

The duration of the price hikes makes them particularly anxiety-inducing, because businesses can’t anticipate their impact on future sales. Up the street from Coach’s, James Lamb, 43, pointed at a row of candy bars and let out a small sigh. Already, his Evolution Candy store in downtown Doylesville had raised the price of Charms sour balls from $2 to $2.25. One of the store’s novelty items, a roughly foot-long Rice Krispy treat, once sold for $19.95 but now goes for $25.95. And the store may have to raise the price of its traditional candy bars — like Hershey’s and Twix — from $1.50 to $1.65.

“We want to go for $1.65, but the community might not be ready for it,” Lamb said. “We’re eating some things,” he said of the higher prices being paid to suppliers, “because we can’t eat it all at once and hike everything.”

After stimulus reprieve, vulnerable Americans falling ‘thousands of dollars behind’

For about two decades, Colleen Lester, 53, had put off treating the chronic pain in her back and hip. But when her stimulus check arrived last spring, she was finally able to pay for a specialty chiropractor who relieved her symptoms. “It was peace of mind — not constantly worried about paying my bills. We always struggled financially, and I’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck,” Lester said. “I tried not to spend that money. It was, ‘Oh my gosh’; it felt so nice.”

But now Lester says she is back to scrambling to keep her bank balance above the $100 minimum. A day-care provider, Lester has cut back on buying healthy food at the grocery store and stopped purchasing organic food. She is also trying to eat less overall. She is unsure if she can continue to afford the treatment for her back. “I’m feeling the anxiety a lot now,” she said. “What if something breaks? I really don’t have anything in my bank account.”

While it was primarily intended on boosting the economy overall, the biggest impact from the federal stimulus may have been on improving the safety net. From December 2020 to April 2021, when the Biden administration sent out $1,400 stimulus checks, the share of Americans nationwide reporting that they did not have enough to eat fell by 40 percent, according to University of Michigan poverty researchers. Financial instability fell by 45 percent, the researchers found. “Adverse mental health symptoms” fell by more than 20 percent.

These benefits have not entirely dissipated. Americans at the bottom of the income distribution appear, by many indicators, to be better off financially than they were before the pandemic. Nationally, Americans’ bank accounts still remain roughly 70 percent higher than where they were before the pandemic started, according to data from JPMorgan Chase. Seventy-eight percent of Americans reported doing at least okay financially at the end of 2021, according to a Federal Reserve survey — the highest rate since 2013, when the survey began. Delinquencies on auto loans, mortgages and credit card debts remain low by historical standards.

But the trend is clear: The JPMorgan data shows a 35 percent drop in the bank accounts of poor families relative from last spring to this past February — a number that is not adjusted for 8 percent inflation as well over the last year — although balances increased slightly due to tax refunds sent in March.

The share of Americans who reported sometimes or often going hungry plummeted to 8 percent in April 2021. It had risen back to 10 percent by February of this year, according to a research paper by University of Michigan poverty researchers Patrick Cooney, H. Luke Shaefer and Samiul Jubaed. Similarly, the percentage of Americans who said it was very difficult to pay for household expenses increased from roughly 9.8 percent in April 2021 to 14 percent this February, the paper found. Feeding America, one of the biggest national food bank organizations, said 80 percent of its organization saw demand increase or stay the same from April to March of this year.

These head winds are evident in Bucks County, too. Calls for help to Between Friends Outreach, a nonprofit that helps house and feed struggling families, are up from roughly 60 a month to 100 a month, according to Tara Stoop, the group’s managing director. Doylestown FISH, another emergency assistance nonprofit, said requests for help plunged from 767 in 2019 to around 500 during the pandemic. This year, they’re on track to surpass the 2019 levels of requests for help. Utility shut-offs were suspended during the pandemic before resuming last year.

“The requests for help with utility bills we used to get were for $500 or $600,” said Marijane Harris, the group’s president. “Now people are thousands of dollars behind. Our numbers have changed drastically.”

The economic whiplash has been more drastic for parents than perhaps any other group. Johnson has lost not just Biden’s child tax credit of $300 per month for young kids, which expired at the end of last year, but also most of her food stamp payments, which were slashed from $600 per month (bumped up by a temporary federal assistance program during the pandemic) to $32. Baby formula that cost $13 is now $22 — when she can find it — and gas to get to work and pick up the kids costs hundreds more.

With her kids’ toys scattered on the carpet, Johnson looked out the window of her apartment — where the rent just increased from $325 to $500 per month — and remembered her feeling when the stimulus payments arrived last year. She is pregnant, and is not sure where she will live when she gives birth again next year.

The better future she dreamed about a year ago seems like it’s slipping out of reach."
Dec 20 2021,EPA finalizes tougher new fuel economy rules,Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/epa-finalizes-tougher-new-fuel-economy-rules,"The EPA has finalized new fuel economy rules for the years 2023 to 2026 that set tougher standards than those established during the Trump administration.

The new target raises the fleet average fuel economy requirement by 25% from 32 mpg to 40 mpg, according to Reuters. President Biden had previously proposed a 38 mpg requirement in August and has encouraged automakers to transition their lineups to 50% electric vehicles by 2030.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents most consumer automakers, called the plan ""aggressive"" and said meeting the standards ""will undoubtedly require enactment of supportive governmental policies – including consumer incentives, substantial infrastructure growth, fleet requirements, and support for U.S. manufacturing and supply chain development.""

The EPA announcement comes just a day after it became clear that President Biden's Build Back Better plan, which included a new maximum federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases of $12,500, was unlikely to pass in its current form.

Oct 13 2022,Inflation holds grip on the U.S. economy as September rate hits 8.2%,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/inflation-rate-september-2022-cost-of-food-gas-rent-consumer-prices-rcna51958,"The annual U.S. inflation rate was little changed last month, hitting 8.2% year over year compared with August's 8.3% reading as the pace of price increases remains at multidecade highs, causing pain for many households.

High prices for food, shelter and medical care sent the consumer price index for September up by 0.4%, compared to August's 0.1%, according to data the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Thursday morning.

Markets opened lower following the news as investors tried to gauge how the Federal Reserve will respond.

Inflation remains at the top of Americans' minds going into the last quarter of a year of across-the-board volatility in food, gasoline and energy prices.

While the Biden administration has sought to address the issue through measures like the Inflation Reduction Act, the provisions in that law are set to take effect over 10 years, and at least two separate models predict its actual impact on inflation will be statistically insignificant.

So the burden of bridling a stubborn inflation rate sits at the doorstep of the Federal Reserve. The central bank has already increased its benchmark rate five times this year — which included three consecutive 0.75% hikes — to make borrowing and spending money more expensive to cool off consumer demand.

At its most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Fed officials largely agreed that it was better to aggressively raise interest rates now to avoid economic pain down the road.

The housing market has felt the most immediate impact of the Fed's rate-raising scheme. At nearly 7%, mortgage rates are at their highest levels in close to two decades, which has slowed home price growth in its tracks and caused prices to fall in some cities.

Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams said house prices and rents are likely to decline throughout the U.S. in the coming months.

What remains to be seen, he said, is whether other key costs, especially those for food, will also come down. Lowering those expenses might be out of the federal government's hands, he said.

""There's definitely still a Russia-Ukraine effect keeping food prices elevated,"" he said. ""Commodities futures prices for grain have been high since the start of the Russian invasion.""

Food costs also reflect higher energy costs, he said, and while gas price declines last month likely affected the headline inflation reading, Adams noted that pump prices have already begun to climb back up amid higher demand. In addition, OPEC+ announced last week it would cut oil production by 2 million barrels a day, which sent crude oil prices to nearly $98 last Friday.

Finally, an apparent shortage of workers has continued to put upward pressure on wages, Adams said. Last month, the unemployment rate hit 3.5%, tying the pre-pandemic low and suggesting most people who want to find work are able to do so while also commanding higher wages.

""Food price inflation is going to stay a problem in U.S. for the next couple of months,"" Adams said. ""Wage growth in the U.S. is considerably faster than it was pre-pandemic, especially in lower-paying occupations like food services.""

Jun 05 2023,"North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum Teases Presidential Bid, Country Needs a 'New Leader for a Changing Economy'",Breitbart News,right,https://breitbart.com/politics/2023/06/05/north-dakota-governor-doug-burgum-teases-presidential-bid-country-needs-new-leader-changing-economy,"North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum (R) teased his presidential bid in a video released on Monday, calling for a “new leader for a changing economy.”

Burgum, who is working his way through his second term in North Dakota, released his campaign video ahead of his expected presidential campaign launch on Wednesday.

The North Dakota Republican teased his humble North Dakota origins, rising from a “small-town” worker who paid his way through college to build a “world-class” software business in North Dakota. Burgum grew his software business into a $1 billion software company, after which his company was acquired by Microsoft.

In his teaser video, Burgum says the country needs dynamic reform to meet the needs of tomorrow.

He called for “innovation over regulation,” selling energy to America’s allies instead of buying it from America’s enemies, and shrinking federal government power back to the states.

The North Dakota governor touted that, under his leadership, the Roughrider State managed to balance its budget, cut red tape, and cut taxes.

He also called for eliminating political brinksmanship that has seemed to envelop Washington, DC.

“Anger, yelling, infighting, that’s not going to cut it anymore,” he said.

“We talk things out. That’s how we can get America back on track,” the governor added.

While Burgum’s teaser video focused mainly on the economy and jobs, he has weighed in on social issues grappling the nation.

Burgum signed a law that would enact a near-total ban on abortion in April. He also signed a bill that would require teachers to inform parents if their child is transgender.

Fox News reported that Burgum will visit Iowa on Thursday and Friday and then travel to New Hampshire this weekend.

Burgum defeated the Republican establishment candidate in 2016 to win the GOP bid for governor. Fargo radio talk show host Mike McFeely described Burgum’s 2016 victory as the “political upset of the ages.” In 2020, Burgum was reelected in a landslide.

Burgum will be joining a crowded field of candidates, facing off against former President Donald Trump, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), former Vice President Mike Pence, former ambassador Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy.

The North Dakota governor will reportedly use his “extensive personal wealth and financial network” to boost his dark-horse candidacy.

Dec 10 2020,The appointments Biden needs to prioritize to revitalize the economy,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22163440/joe-biden-fed-board-governors-build-back-better,"Joe Biden is still more than a month away from taking office, but already the basic tasks of his first year in office seem quite clear: He has to end the Covid-19 pandemic, and he has to end the recession and economic fallout from the pandemic.

Most attention on the latter has focused, understandably, on what relief package Biden will be able to pass through Congress. There’s a chance that a bipartisan effort to expand unemployment insurance benefits and state/local government aid will succeed under Trump, but if not Biden will be forced to negotiate a deal with either a Republican Senate or a 50-50 one with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking ties.

That’s economic job No. 1. But there’s another key aspect of Biden’s relief strategy that hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves: his Federal Reserve appointments. It might not get as much attention as an administration’s legislative priorities, but the Fed is extremely consequential, and past Democratic presidents like Barack Obama have ignored it to their detriment (and Trump, to his credit, has not).

While coverage of it is mostly limited to the business press, the Fed’s work has enormous consequences for everyday workers and consumers. One of its central jobs is setting the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, and deciding the interest it pays on funds (“reserves”) that those banks keep at the Fed itself.

When the Fed raises interest rates, that ripples out through the whole economy. Because banks are paying more interest to borrow money they will then lend out, the interest rates they charge on everything from mortgages to auto loans to credit cards go up. Business loans becoming more expensive makes businesses less likely to expand or hire. That slows down the economy — and, conversely, lowering rates heats the economy up. So a Fed committed to rock-bottom rates is incredibly important for making sure the 2021 recovery is fast.

Biden will get at least one pick for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors upon taking office in January, and soon thereafter will have to decide on a pick to chair the Fed. These are likely to be among the most important domestic policy decisions he makes in his presidency, and he ought to prioritize getting dovish nominees — nominees who will keep interest rates low and prioritize employment over inflation— on the Board.

Why Biden should prioritize the Fed

To simplify drastically, the Fed has two major roles: regulating banks and related financial institutions, and conducting monetary policy (that is, adjusting the money supply to maintain stable inflation and low unemployment). Both of these are crucially important — the former especially for its potential to prevent financial crises — but the latter makes the Fed the single most important economic agency in the United States.

By pushing economic activity closer to its potential, the Fed generates, on an ongoing basis, hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars’ worth of economic output that would otherwise be lost, with massive positive humanitarian consequences both in the US and abroad.

In recent decades, this has been achieved through “loose” policy of low interest rates and aggressive Fed purchases of bonds (“quantitative easing”). When the Fed fails, usually by being too “tight” in its policies, the consequences are equivalently dire. And good monetary policy is especially important during recessions and recoveries like the one the US finds itself in right now.

This is an odd recession, precipitated by a pandemic incapacitating or killing millions of workers and consumers, as well as preventing certain kinds of economic activity (indoor dining, gyms, etc.) from taking place. Fixing the overall pandemic has to come first. But as we get it under control, ramping economic activity back up is going to be crucial.

The Fed’s monetary policy is decided by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). At full capacity, the FOMC has 12 members: seven members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, who are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, plus the head of the New York regional Fed and a rotating group of four of the other 11 regional banks (Minneapolis, Dallas, Cleveland, and Philadelphia are in right now). The regional bank presidents are selected by members of their boards of directors, subject to the approval of the nationwide board of governors; the board of governors also has some say in who the directors of the regional banks are.

The upshot is the president has limited control over the selection of five of the 12 important decision-makers, and a high level of control over the other seven. And with one of those seven seats currently vacant, Biden will have the ability to shift the FOMC immediately.

The current state of play on the Fed

The Obama administration, despite taking office amid a massive economic collapse, did not prioritize Fed appointees early on, and when it did make picks, more often than not they leaned against measures to speed up the recovery, rather than pushing for them.

Jeremy Stein, the Harvard economics professor whom Obama appointed to the Board and served from 2012 to 2014, suggested that the Fed should consider raising interest rates and slowing down the economy for “macroprudential” reasons: inflicting pain early might prevent a bubble from developing and causing pain later. That theory is quite controversial within macroeconomics, whereas it’s clear that raising interest rates costs people jobs.

In other cases, the administration picked solid nominees who initially seemed committed to promoting employment growth with low interest rates, only for them to turn surprisingly hawkish. Former Chair Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Stanley Fischer, who had reputations as dovish when their terms began in 2014, instead pushed forward with an interest rate hike in 2015 that harmed the economic recovery. It’s certainly possible that an alternative regime (say under Fed Chair Larry Summers) would have been worse, but better still would have been for the Fed to simply not raise rates and allow the economy to continue to recover.

Trump has been much more attentive to the Fed, much to his chair Jay Powell’s chagrin; after appointing Powell in part because he reportedly thought Yellen was too short to be chair, Trump spent the rest of his presidency verbally abusing him in an effort to lower interest rates. That’s led to rampant speculation that Powell’s subsequent low interest rate policies were the result of Trump’s pressure. It seems likelier, as Josh Barro noted in a recent profile of Powell, that he is simply listening to stakeholders, like labor and businesses, who have urged the Fed to deemphasize worries about accelerating inflation and reemphasize the Fed’s mandate to maximize employment.

Trump has most recently made a lame-duck push to get more appointees confirmed. In mid-November, the Senate narrowly voted against Judy Shelton, a gold-standard-backing, crankish nominee Trump has put forward. In theory, the Senate could vote on her nomination again, but with a few Republicans opposing her and Arizona special election winner Sen. Mark Kelly (D) having since taken office and reduced the party’s majority, her nomination looks dead in the water.

Meanwhile, Christopher Waller, a career economist at the St. Louis regional Fed bank with a much more pro-employment record than Shelton, was narrowly confirmed on December 3. Despite unanimous Democratic opposition to Waller, he’s a pretty great addition from Biden’s perspective. He and his former boss and ally, St. Louis Fed president James Bullard, are outspoken “doves” who want the Fed to aggressively try to reduce unemployment and not worry too much about sparking inflation.

With Waller confirmed and Shelton all but rejected, Biden will have one vacancy to fill as soon as he takes office. But the Fed has a lot of turnover, and Republican members retiring is likely. Moreover, Powell’s term is up in February 2022, so in a few months Biden will need to decide whether to reappoint Powell or pick a replacement.

The candidates for a Biden Fed

There’s a good case for reappointing Powell. He mistakenly raised interest rates in 2018 but corrected his error by cutting them a year later, and has been extremely aggressive in using the Fed’s powers to expand businesses’ access to funds during the Covid-19 crisis.

Most importantly, Powell announced a new “monetary policy framework” in August 2020 that commits the bank to keeping interest rates near zero even if inflation exceeds its target of 2 percent per year, given that inflation has been lower than that level for much of the past decade. The framework also indicates that the Fed will not raise interest rates simply because it thinks unemployment has gotten sufficiently low, to what economists sometimes call its “natural rate.” That kind of reasoning motivated the 2015 and 2018 rate hikes, and Powell’s announcement suggested the Fed as an institution is foreswearing that reasoning in the near to medium term.

But Biden might want to put his own stamp on the institution. Reappointing Yellen, currently nominated to serve as treasury secretary, would make some sense; the 2015 hike was a blunder, but Yellen is an enthusiastic backer of the Fed’s new approach and seems like she’d be more dovish in a second term. Powell learned from his mistaken rate hike, and Yellen might learn from hers.

Two other names I’ve heard floated most frequently by Fed watchers as potential chairs are Lael Brainard, who has served on the Board of Governors since 2014, and Raphael Bostic, who leads the Atlanta Fed bank. Brainard was widely considered a possible treasury secretary until Yellen was picked, but she might be more effective as chair. She’s arguably the most dovish member of the Board currently, arguing in a late 2019 speech that rate hikes in recent years had been errors and that the urge to increase rates just to “normalize” was dangerous. She has also repeatedly dissented from Trump-era initiatives to weaken financial regulations, suggesting she’d be tougher on Wall Street than Powell.

Bostic would likely need to be appointed as a governor first; going straight from a regional bank to chair would be a big leap. But he would make history as the first Black and first openly gay Fed chair. That said, some advocates of full employment are skeptical of Bostic, arguing that his approach to monetary policy is more reminiscent of the school of thought that led to the job-costing 2015 and 2018 rate hikes than Powell’s new, more dovish approach. He has suggested, echoing Stein, that getting unemployment “too low” can lead to bubbles and excessive risk-taking. Elsewhere he’s written that the view that the Fed should force unemployment as low as possible is a “short-sighted perspective that doesn’t ultimately serve the economy and American workers well.” That would be an unfortunate view to have in the chair’s seat, but it’s possible Bostic’s views have evolved.

Setting aside the chair job, there are many options for filling the open governor seat, including some Republicans who could be easy Senate confirmations. Whereas government spending and taxes are issues that are very polarized along party lines, there are Fed hawks and doves on both sides of the aisle, which means Biden could pick some right-leaning economists and still get the policies he wants. George Mason’s David Beckworth and Bloomberg’s Karl Smith both come to mind as libertarian-leaning figures who’d fit the bill.

Some other names (of various ideological backgrounds) I’ve heard touted from advocates for high-employment monetary policy are Julia Coronado, a veteran Fed economist; Obama Treasury Department veteran Ernie Tedeschi; Paul McCulley, a former chief economist at the investment manager PIMCO; Fed veteran Claudia Sahm; former Minneapolis bank president Narayana Kocherlakota; and, the most cited name I’ve heard, Bill Spriggs, an economist at Howard University and chief economist for the AFL-CIO.

Spriggs would only be the fourth Black member of the Board of Governors, a testament to how terribly the institution has done on racial diversity over its 107-year history. Luckily, there are a lot of strong Black candidates, from Michigan State University’s Lisa Cook (an adviser to the Biden transition) to the Economic Policy Institute’s Valerie Wilson. Spriggs would also be the only governor in history with a background in organized labor, which would be an important step for an institution that has had tight ties to capital (and specifically the financial sector) but has occasionally failed to advance the interests of workers.

I don’t want to exaggerate the Fed’s importance; in some ways, the most important thing Biden can do is make sure it stays the course and maintains hyper-low interest rates throughout his term, barring a sudden shocking rise in inflation. The Fed could experiment with other ways to aid the recovery, like ramping up its purchases of government debt, or using debt purchases as a way to fund the federal government through printing money, or explicitly trying to keep the interest rate on government debt at or near zero so Congress is more inclined to enact a stimulus package. But those would be very aggressive, last-resort moves.

Still, doing no harm is important if Biden wants this recovery to stick. And doing no harm begins with taking the Fed seriously and thinking hard about whom to pick, starting right now."
Jun 04 2022,DeSantis Scorches 'A Fellow by the Name of Brandon' Over the Economy,Independent Journal Review,right,https://ijr.com/watch-desantis-scorches-fellow-name-brandon/,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) torched President Joe Biden over the state of the economy, appearing to refer to him as “a fellow by the name of Brandon.”

DeSantis took aim at Biden after signing the 2022-23 state budget of $109.9 billion on Thursday.

“We have to look at what we’re doing against the backdrop of what’s going on in Washington, D.C. and particularly there’s a fellow by the name of Brandon that people talk about, that we have to contend with,” DeSantis said.

DeSantis was referring to the slogan used by Republicans to diss the president, “Let’s Go Brandon.”

He continued, “I see this news report where Biden is so frustrated that his approval ratings are in the toilet. He can’t understand. He’s lashing out at his staff. He’s blaming other people. He’s blaming the media.”

The governor argued Biden, upon entering office, “Immediately waged war against American energy production. You see record gas prices in the United States, well that’s a big reason why, because of his policies.”

He explained, “You look at what they did in terms of fiscal and monetary, printing and borrowing trillions and trillions of dollars. What did you get for that? The most sustained inflation this country has seen in over 40 years.”

Additionally, DeSantis criticized Biden for damaging the economy with his COVID-19 policies.

“And he failed to take leadership and take decisive action to alleviate the supply chain crisis that we’ve seen really beguiling not only this country but places around the world. And so he has created the circumstances that have led to this resounding disapproval of what he has done,” DeSantis explained.

On Wednesday, CNN reported on Gallup’s most recent Economic Confidence Index number, which “summarizes Americans’ ratings of current economic conditions and whether the economy is getting better or worse.”

The rating from May is -45.

CNN explained the number “is the public’s most negative view of the economy Gallup has measured since the end of the Great Recession in early 2009.”

On Tuesday, Biden met with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and declared he is focused on inflation.

“I’m meeting with the chairman today and Secretary Yellen to discuss my top priority, that is addressing inflation in order to transition from historic recovery to a steady growth for American families,” Biden said.

He continued, “And my plan is to address inflation, starts with a simple proposition: respect the Fed, respect the Fed’s independence, which I have done and will continue to do.”"
Nov 26 2021,"Americans are mad about the economy, but still ready to shop",Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22791953/inflation-christmas-shopping-thanksgiving-black-friday-target-walmart,"Holiday shopping is going to be annoying this year. Many things are more expensive, and in-demand items are hard to find. It’s a real “All I want for Christmas is to stop hearing about supply chains and inflation for half a second” moment.

While it’s a weird time in the economy, that weirdness isn’t necessarily translating to people holding back on buying. People are shopping a little differently this holiday season, but they’re not not shopping. Nearly two years into a pandemic, the American consumer will not be deterred, at least not entirely.

But they probably won’t be happy about it. The consumer price index, which measures what consumers pay for goods and services, increased by 6.2 percent from a year ago in October, and it crept up by 0.9 percent over the course of the month alone. Regardless of the arguments over how serious a threat inflation is to the American economy right now (some economists say it’s a big deal, others that it’s not), consumers hate it. The price of food is up 5.3 percent over the last year, meaning holiday meals are going to be more expensive. Gas is pricey, too, meaning so is traveling by car. Big-ticket items, including cars, are more expensive, but so are smaller-ticket ones, like apparel.

Likewise, supply chain problems are popping up in many places. Before people can even worry about how much something is going to cost, they’ve got to first wonder whether they’re even going to be able to get ahold of it.

Despite the one-two punch of inflation and supply chain woes, it seems like consumers are determined to forge ahead. Some people are spending a little earlier, but they still appear to be spending. As the job market improves and more people get back to work, they’ve got more money to put out there, which they are.

“You get more people employed, and obviously, more people employed means more income and therefore it means more total consumption,” said Michael Gapen, head of US economics research at Barclays. “None of this is to say that we should be happy with where inflation is — it’s a problem.”

Consumers are annoyed, but still buying

Consumers are certainly not happy with the current economic situation.

The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, which measures how consumers are feeling, fell to its lowest level since 2011 in November. Richard Curtin, chief economist at the survey, in commentary on the results, said the sentiment is a result of the “escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation.” People were especially frustrated with the rising prices of homes, vehicles, and durable goods.

To put the way consumers are feeling in perspective, they feel worse than they did in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic was sweeping the country, and it really seemed as though the United States might be heading into an economic depression. To be sure, there’s a partisan divide with these survey results (Republicans feel bad about the economy with a Democrat in the White House, Democrats feel bad about the economy with a Republican in the White House), but people are still generally displeased with the economy.

Still, they plan to spend or, at least, try to. According to a survey from the Conference Board from October, consumers are poised to spend an average of $1,022 on holiday gifts and related items this holiday season, with $648 going toward gifts and $374 being directed elsewhere. The gift spending is slightly down from 2019 and 2020, perhaps in part because people are expecting to be able to socialize more this year and accrue costs associated with that.

“We saw a little bit of a decline in what they said they intended to purchase for gifts, but nothing really substantial,” said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators and surveys at the Conference Board.

The Conference Board’s survey found that people are ready to get back out there and head to the mall on Black Friday and beyond, as concerns about the Covid-19 outbreak lessen. People anticipate buying gift cards as well as apparel, toys, and games.

“They do expect to pay more for both food and gifts this year compared to last year,” Franco said. “At least at this point in time, it doesn’t appear to be deterring or impacting spending overall.”

Nikki Baird, vice president of retail innovation at Aptos, a retail technology company, said some retailers are, in part, anticipating a “back to basics” holiday. Some retailers narrowed the assortment of products available on their shelves in light of the uncertainty surrounding the holiday, replicating a tactic they used around back-to-school time. It’s not that you’re not going to be able to find, say, holiday candles; it’s just that there will maybe be 10 options instead of 20. This year, there’s also no big must-have toy.

“There’s no character-driven merchandise from blockbuster movies, there’s no toys from blockbuster movies, because there haven’t been any blockbuster movies,” Baird said. “It’s fascinating to me to see that parents are really concentrating on back-to-basics toys.”

Holiday shoppers are shopping earlier (and stores are still offering discounts)

Current economic conditions aren’t necessarily stifling holiday shopping, but they are changing it as people try to adjust to the current landscape.

October retail sales rose by 1.7 percent compared to the previous month, according to the US Department of Commerce. Consumer spending went up in online shopping, electronics and appliances, department stores, building materials, cars, sports, and music, among other items. With the news, JPMorgan upgraded its expectations for economic growth in the fourth quarter.

Part of what’s going on is that people seem to be doing their shopping a little earlier this year. Given all the headlines about supply chain woes and potential shortages, it’s understandable. So some of the holiday retail sales that would normally take place in November and December were pulled into October.

Baird said that the retailers she works with are certainly seeing some earlier shoppers this year compared to holiday seasons past. Thus far, consumers seem more concerned about being able to get items than what they’re paying for it. “They are less price-sensitive,” she said. “They’re not put off by the higher prices; they’re more concerned about availability.”

Retailers are putting forward relatively rosy forecasts for the holidays despite hiccups. Walmart beat third-quarter earnings expectations after its sales rose and said it’s preparing for a “strong holiday season.” Home Depot, Target, and TJX (the parent company of TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and HomeGoods) posted strong third-quarter earnings as well and expect holiday business to be good, despite some challenges. Ernie Herrman, the CEO of TJX, said the company is in an “excellent inventory position, with most of the product needed for the holiday season either on hand or scheduled to arrive at our stores and online in time for the holidays.”

How retailers are handling inflation pressures can vary. As CNBC notes, Walmart and Target are trying to keep their costs low in order to keep customers coming back, even if that cuts into their profits. It’s not a strategy investors love.

There’s a sort of game of chicken that retailers have to play with each other every year around the holidays. They’re competing to capture what is typically a relatively set budget on the part of consumers. Discounts and promotions are a way to get consumers in the door; the hope is they’ll fill up their carts while they’re there.

Baird said that Aptos has noticed that retailers are offering fewer or shallower discounts, which may be a way to deal with inflation. “They are offering promotions to try to attract consumers, but they either scaled back the depth of the promotion or how many things are on promotion,” she said. Instead of, say, offering 40 percent off the entire store, a retailer will offer 25 percent off winter accessories. “Part of it is also an inflation hedge. You don’t have to raise prices on your base price if you’re offering a shallower discount because you’ve got some protection in your margin built in.”

Some retailers are also shifting their inventory around in an attempt to combat potential shipping issues, in the e-commerce space especially, Baird said. She expects some retailers will move items to physical stores and encourage consumers to shop in store or order online and pick up instead of depending on direct-to-consumer e-commerce shipments, especially as the holidays approach.

This holiday economy is still better than the last one

Here are some headlines from around this time last year: “The US Covid outbreak is worse than it’s ever been.” “On the eve of Thanksgiving, the US recorded its highest single-day coronavirus death toll since May.” “Trump vetoing the Covid stimulus bill could be disastrous.” None of that was good.

The US seems better positioned with the pandemic than it was a year ago — vaccines are widely available, and many people have gotten them. Coronavirus case counts have risen again recently in some parts of the country, but are still below where they were last year at this point. With the economy, things are generally better, too. Government stimulus has put real money into real people’s pockets. The country is continuing to add back the millions of jobs lost. The October 2020 unemployment rate was 6.9 percent; the October 2021 unemployment rate was 4.6 percent.

Gapen noted that wages have on average kept up with inflation, though price increases are cutting into some income gains. In the bigger picture, on aggregate, labor market income is going up because more people are working more hours at higher wages as they go back to work and get paid better. In October, the economy added 531,000 more jobs, and numbers from August and September were revised upward by an additional 235,000 jobs.

“That’s three-quarters of a million more people who will be earning income,” Gapen said. “They are going from, in theory, earning nothing to earning whatever the median income is in the US. So yeah, inflation’s gone up, but your purchasing power’s just gone up by a lot more.”

None of this is to say that there aren’t real problems or that the economy is perfect. The supply chain issues are complicated; so is inflation. If you want to buy a new car right now, it’s going to be much pricier than it would have been a year ago. Home prices are up a ton if you’re on the market. Overall, daily life is costlier, including gas and food. And if you are spending more to put gas in your car, you might wind up spending less on Christmas presents, or at least consider it. There are a lot of open questions about when things will get back to normal, and about what “normal” will look like. Still, overall, many people are better off.

Thus far, it looks as though many consumers are determined to celebrate the holiday as usual, by spending money. And if you have to buy a little less or differently but are able to spend the time more safely with your loved ones, it’s not the worst trade-off in the world."
May 30 2023,GOP 'Freedom Caucus' admits debt ceiling obstinacy is all about tanking economy to help Trump win,Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/5/30/2172338/-GOP-Freedom-Caucus-admits-debt-ceiling-obstinacy-is-all-about-tanking-economy-to-help-Trump-win,"The so-called “Freedom Caucus,” that group of supposedly ideologically committed, failed seditionists that command a sizable portion of the House Republican majority, are throwing a hissy fit right now. They’re piqued at the deal struck by their elected Speaker, Kevin McCarthy, and President Joe Biden, in which McCarthy managed to extort some concessions from the White House in exchange for magnanimously allowing the nation to meet its obligations and pay the bills that Congress has incurred on behalf of the American public for the last few years.

Those bills, which would have been considerably easier to pay without the massive tax giveaway Republicans passed in 2017 as a reward to their billionaire corporate donors, have come due, and like all deadbeats, these same House Republicans want to skip out on them. The only problem is that by doing so they would tank the entire U.S. economy, along with the rest of the world that depends on the full faith and credit of the United States government.

But contrary to its pretentious title, the “Freedom Caucus” has nothing to do with “freedom,” unless it refers to the freedom to destroy everyone else’s lives so they can retain power. That was made perfectly clear in a statement made on Tuesday by Caucus member, Republican Dan Bishop of North Carolina. Bishop specifically complained about the provision of the Biden-McCarthy deal that extends the ability of this country to pay its bills for two years, effectively preventing the issue from being re-animated by House Republicans in the months prior to the 2024 elections. This is the part of the deal that most infuriates the “Freedom Caucus.” Because they intended to tank the economy in 2024 to help the prospects of their presumed nominee, Donald Trump, who, it is assumed, would rise at that time from his golden toilet bowl to howl about how President Biden destroyed the economy.

RELATED STORY: House Freedom Caucus neutered by debt ceiling deal

It’s really impossible to explain this statement any other way. As reported by Prem Thakker for The New Republic:

One Republican congressman outright admitted his frustration that, if the debt ceiling gets resolved, the Republican presidential nominee won’t be able to run in 2024 on the chaos that would come if the country defaults. “And what does the device of two years do?” North Carolina Representative Dan Bishop posed incredulously on Tuesday, flanked by far-right colleagues like Lauren Boebert and Byron Donalds. “It removes the issue from the national conversation during the presidential election to come. How could you more successfully kneecap any Republican president than to take that issue out of his or her hands?”

The reason this statement is so revealing is that Donald Trump, as the assumed Republican presidential nominee, would have absolutely no input or say on whether the debt ceiling was to be lifted in 2024. He would still be a candidate, restricted to spewing his venom at rallies. The debt ceiling issue in 2024 would still be resolved by the Republican House majority and President Biden. What Rep. Bishop is saying here is that he and his caucus members intended to tank the economy on purpose, in order to bolster Trump’s chances at winning in 2024. And they’re furious now because under the Biden-McCarthy deal they will be unable to do that.

As Thakker writes:

Their intransigence apparently was not just about cutting as much as they could, but also about carrying water for the eventual nominee— which for most far-right members like Bishop means Donald Trump.

That’s what they care about: getting Trump back into office. Not the “deficit,” not the “debt,” not the economy, and certainly not the millions of job losses and complete stock market collapse that would ensue with a default. They don’t give a damn about what a ravaged economy would mean for tens of millions of Americans (including, notably, the ones who voted them into office).

Note Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert’s head nodding in agreement as Bishop speaks:

All they care about is their own power, and installing the same person into office who they failed to get reelected in 2020: Donald Trump. That’s what all this sideshow is about. Bishop was just stupid enough to say it out loud.

Sep 16 2022,FedEx CEO says he expects the economy to enter a ‘worldwide recession’,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/fedex-ceo-says-he-expects-the-economy-to-enter-a-worldwide-recession.html,"FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday that he believes a recession is impending for the global economy.

""I think so. But you know, these numbers, they don't portend very well,"" Subramaniam said in response to Cramer's question of whether the economy is ""going into a worldwide recession.""

The CEO's pessimism came after FedEx missed estimates on revenue and earnings in its first quarter. The company also withdrew its full year guidance.

Shares of FedEx fell 15% in extended trading on Thursday.

""I'm very disappointed in the results that we just announced here, and you know, the headline really is the macro situation that we're facing,"" Subramaniam said in an interview on ""Mad Money.""

The chief executive, who assumed the position earlier this year, said that weakening global shipment volumes drove FedEx's disappointing results. While the company anticipated demand to increase after factories shuttered in China due to Covid opened back up, it actually fell, he said."

Oct 09 2020,What will happen to the economy without more stimulus?,Yahoo! The 360,center,https://news.yahoo.com/what-will-happen-to-the-economy-without-more-stimulus-144721176.html,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

President Trump on Tuesday ordered his administration to halt negotiations over a new economic stimulus bill until after the election. Trump said later that he would be open to signing smaller stand-alone bills that would fund another round of stimulus checks, offer relief to the airline industry and allocate more money for businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program.

But his announcement essentially ended the short-term hopes that Democrats and Republicans might come to an agreement on another comprehensive trillion-dollar aid package to prop up an economy that continues to struggle due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Congress passed a $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill in March after the initial outbreak of the virus forced business activity across the country to grind to a halt. Many economists credit that stimulus package for helping the U.S. avoid a true economic collapse and fueling the steady recovery that took place over the summer. Many of the key provisions of the coronavirus aid bill — like the enhanced benefits it provided to the unemployed — have expired.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had both expressed optimism recently that there may be room for compromise between the $2.2 trillion package passed by House Democrats and the $1.6 trillion bill supported by the administration. The sides were still a ways apart on specific issues, particularly on aid to struggling state and local governments, before Trump shut down the negotiations.

Why there’s debate

Most economists believe additional stimulus is needed to keep the economy on a path to recovery and avoid a “double dip” recession in the coming months. Things have improved significantly since the worst days of the crash. The unemployment rate dropped from a high of 14.7 percent in April to 7.9 percent in September. But there are still 10.7 million fewer people with jobs, and major companies have laid off thousands of workers in recent weeks. Without the $600 weekly boost from enhanced unemployment benefits — which expired in July — many families have seen their incomes drop dramatically. Without additional aid, the country could face an eviction crisis or mass defaults on mortgages.

Many of the temporary job losses caused by lockdown measures could become permanent, others fear, if businesses don’t see reason to believe that more relief funds might be on the horizon or are forced to close. The risk of a “K-shaped recovery” in which the well-off see their prospects steadily improve while low-income people fall deeper into crisis is much greater without provisions to prop up the most vulnerable Americans, some argue. State and local governments might be forced to cut as many as 4 million public sector jobs unless their budgets are bailed out by Congress, one analysis found.

Some experts argue that these fears are overblown. Many fiscal conservatives believe that a massive relief package that adds trillions to the deficit would be worse for the long-term economic outlook than no deal at all. Passing individual bills to address specific needs is a more efficient way of providing the help people need, they argue.

What’s next

Pelosi and Mnuchin have reportedly opened discussions on a bill to offer relief to the airline industry. It’s unclear, however, whether an airline bailout would have enough support from Senate Republicans or whether there would be room on the calendar since confirmation hearings for Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, are expected to dominate the Senate’s focus in the near future.

It’s possible another stimulus bill could be taken up after the election. But the political incentives to do so could shift dramatically depending on who wins control of the White House and the two houses of Congress.

Perspectives

People struggling to get by will fall apart without help

“We had a bridge which took us till about September, and now the question is do we complete the bridge or don’t we? [Without more aid] basically anybody who was on that bridge falls off a cliff.” — Economist Raghuram G. Rajan to New York Times

Stimulus would be unnecessary if lockdown measures were lifted

“The main current economic problem isn’t a lack of demand-side stimulus. It is the continuing restrictions on business and commerce in many states. … The solution is to reopen the economy while protecting the most vulnerable from Covid.” — Editorial, Wall Street Journal

Temporary job losses could become permanent

“The danger is that another delay in relief payments will prompt companies to throw in the towel and make layoffs permanent, and small companies to give up and close. Once such actions have been taken, it takes that much longer for the economy to spring back.” — John Authers, Bloomberg

There could be mass layoffs if businesses lose hope that relief might be coming

“Corporations were holding off on laying off employees in the hopes of further stimulus. With [Tuesday’s] news, I expect that we will see businesses capitulate and begin to announce large scale layoffs,"" — Economist Peter Atwater to Washington Post

Economic inequality will continue to grow

“Absent another stimulus check or more supplemental unemployment benefits, there will be a widening difference in quality of life between those who’ve managed to hold on to work and those who haven’t.” — Taylor Tepper, Forbes

Even more small businesses will be forced to close

“Without a new relief package, small businesses hoping for another round of forgivable loans will be left in the dust. The travel, leisure and entertainment sectors, in particular, may face closures and additional layoffs as colder weather makes dining and entertaining outdoors difficult.” — Niv Elis, The Hill

Millions of public sector workers, like teachers, will lose their jobs

“We're going to go through larger class sizes, failure to do repairs — just like we did coming out of the Great Recession. That's why you saw all those teachers striking,” — AFL-CIO’s chief economist, William Spriggs, to Politico

Promising top-level economic data will mask the pain felt by working-class Americans

“When financial markets are displeased but not distressed by congressional failure to pass another relief package, that may be because of a reasonable expectation that the affluent will get the macroeconomy through this. ... But that effect won’t put food on the table in low-income households, nor will it address the impairment to public services that will come from state and local government austerity if those governments do not receive extensive federal support to avoid budget cuts.” — Josh Barro, New York

The recovery will take longer and be more difficult without financial relief now

“What they are doing now, or rather what they are not doing now, is raising the risk that large bits of the economy will be a wasteland by the time a [COVID-19] vaccine comes through. That doesn’t mean it can never recover, but it does mean that the recovery will be longer and harder and more painful and there’ll be a lot more misery in the meantime. It seems very counterproductive to me.” — Economist Ian Shepherdson to Financial Times

Oct 05 2020,Joe Biden would not remake America’s economy,The Economist,left,https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/03/joe-biden-would-not-remake-americas-economy?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/thepragmatistjoebidenwouldnotremakeamericaseconomybriefing,"S OME LEADERS , when they come into office, have a powerful economic vision for transforming how their country creates wealth and distributes it. Others approach power as pragmatists whose goal is to subtly shape the political and economic forces they inherit. Joe Biden is firmly in the second camp. He is a lifelong centrist whose most enduring economic belief is his admiration for hard-working Americans and who has shifted with the centre of gravity in his party. But Mr Biden’s ability to go with the flow means that, at the moment, both the left and the right are anxious about the prospect of Bidenomics.

Listen to this story. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android Your browser does not support the <audio> element.

Indeed, if Mr Biden wins the election in November and enters the Oval Office in January 2021 he will confront an extraordinary set of circumstances that will put a huge amount of pressure on him. The economy is clawing its way back from the sharpest slump in living memory following covid-19. The legacy of the pandemic will include millions of long-term unemployed, public debts that will soon exceed their all-time high of 106% of GDP , more bankruptcies and accelerated digital disruption in many industries.

At the same time Mr Biden will head up a party that has indeed shifted more to the left and that has a more radical wing that, while not dominant, is influential and thinks America’s economic model is broken and that the answer is a vastly bigger state. Combined with this, the public is bitterly divided and many people are wary of globalisation. Under President Donald Trump, America’s standing in the world has slumped.

Because of this chaotic backdrop and Mr Biden’s own lack of a fixed economic doctrine, the range of outcomes attributed to a Biden presidency is bewildering and not always benign. To some Republicans on Wall Street and in boardrooms he would enable a hostile takeover by the radical left. “The country is running the risk of structural changes under the guise of social justice which would take the US into a place where it won’t know how to function,” claims one. To the left Mr Biden is a timid figure whose moderation means he would be crushed by an obstructive Congress and conservative courts.

Born to run

Neither view is especially convincing once you consider Mr Biden’s goals. He says he will seek to tilt the balance of American capitalism in favour of workers, not the rich. He will offer competent administration; he is no fan of social experiments or trampling on institutions. His priority would be a stimulus bill to revive growth, though he is likely to pull America somewhat further to the left than either of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton (see chart 1). He would leave the economy greener, with a more active industrial policy, somewhat higher public spending and borders open to skilled migrants. He would not reverse America’s new protectionism, nor does he have a plan to resolve the country’s long-term fiscal problems.

Mr Biden’s long career does not exactly suggest much enthusiasm for economics. During his 36 years in the Senate his main passions were the justice system and foreign policy. By instinct he is an admirer of the middle-class more than the country’s glittering plutocratic elite or its downtrodden. He grew up in, and later represented, Delaware, a diminutive state which relies on big business to make its crust. Over two-thirds of Fortune 500 firms are legally registered there thanks to its shareholder-friendly laws and tax rules. The Diamond State is home to the headquarters of some icons of 20th-century industry, including DuPont, some of whose workers lived in the suburb Mr Biden spent his teens in. His exposure to such folk may help explain his fondness for manufacturing and a more paternalistic capitalism. As vice-president in 2009-17 Mr Biden helped implement the stimulus package of 2009 and strike budget deals. But his strength was as a negotiator with Congress, not as a visionary. Allies from his Senate and White House years make up a big share of his advisers and entourage now, with additional advice coming from centre-left economists such as Jared Bernstein, Heather Boushey and Ben Harris. Unlike Mr Obama, he has not appointed a dominant economic figure to his team so far.

Jack of all trades

As a result, in order to understand where a Biden presidency might take the economy it is necessary to consider the three external forces that he will have to deal with, each of which could in theory push him down a more radical path. The first is the covid-19-induced recession. America has bounced back faster than was originally feared. GDP is now expected to shrink by 4% this year; at one point a decline of 7% had seemed likely. But the recovery could stumble, not least because Congress has so far failed to agree on a further stimulus bill.

What is already clear, however, is that the slump has hit the poor worst, amplifying inequality. Many business figures warn of a surge in defaults among small firms which have found it hard to secure government help: less than 1% of the misfiring $600bn Main Street lending scheme backed by the Federal Reserve and Treasury has been disbursed. State and local governments face a funding crunch. The disruption is not simply a matter of a temporary downturn. Whole industries, including travel and retail, will be transformed.

And the normal laws of economics have been upended. Interest rates are at rock-bottom levels, making borrowing almost free for now. America will run a fiscal deficit of 16% of GDP this year. Asset prices, meanwhile, are sky-high with the stockmarket at its most expensive level since the dotcom bubble of 2000, based on its ratio of price to cyclically adjusted profits.

As he grapples with this topsy-turvy economy, Mr Biden will have to deal with a second force in the form of the left wing of his party. Over a third of voters in the Democratic primaries supported Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, whose plans involved a giant expansion in annual government spending. Since then Mr Biden has skillfully flattered the more radical left while ignoring their more ambitious proposals, such as nationalised health care and the “Green New Deal”, a package promoted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswomen, among others, which includes a guaranteed job for all. In July a joint Biden-Sanders task force agreed on watered-down policy recommendations. Some of these Mr Biden then further diluted into his own proposals. Even so, the left will still demand jobs in any administration. And the centre of the party remains to the left of public opinion. Opinion polls suggest the typical American is more worried about climate change and China than they used to be, and more relaxed about government borrowing (see chart 2). But 87% of them still believe in free enterprise.

The final external force Mr Biden would face is Congress. The Economist’s election model gives the Democrats a 98% chance of holding control of the House of Representatives and 69% chance of winning the Senate, with any swing bringing new moderate Democrats in. Assuming the normal rules are in play the Senate will limit what can be done. If Mr Biden’s party ends up with between 50 and 59 seats and sticks to normal Senate protocol over the use of the filibuster, it will only be able to get through tax and spending legislation that either has bipartisan support or can be passed using a process known as reconciliation. This typically limits the number of bills to three a year (one each on spending, tax and debt-limits), does not permit changes to social security and normally requires that the impact on the deficit is neutral within ten years, either because the spending measures expire or are balanced by tax rises. But the Democrats could ditch procedural rules over the filibuster so that they can pass major bills with only 50 votes (plus one from the vice-president who can cast a deciding vote). This might also allow them to pursue other goals including expanding the number of Supreme Court judges. Faced with these external influences, what would Mr Biden do? He would have three main ways to exercise power: through legislation, job appointments and executive action including regulation. Start with legislation, where Mr Biden has proposals that would raise spending by $7trn over a decade. Congress will almost certainly act as a constraint on this. The Democratic Party’s centre of gravity in the House is still centrist: the largest caucus, with over 100 members, is the moderate New Democrat Coalition. Most new seats won would probably be occupied by moderates, and they also hold key jobs, including the head of the Ways and Means committee, which controls tax legislation. In the Senate, meanwhile, even if the Democrats won a big enough majority to try to ditch the filibuster, which is unlikely (a rough yardstick is they would need 55 seats), Mr Biden might well resist: his affection for the institution is such that he kept a Senate gym locker when he was vice-president, and any change in the filibuster rules would be a dramatic constitutional escalation in the war between the two parties. Any Democratic swing will see moderates win seats.

Land of hope and dreams

All this means Mr Biden will have to compromise and might only get two big priorities passed through Congress. That suggests that any increase in the size of the state would be limited. Ms Warren and Mr Sanders proposed spending increases equivalent to 16-23% of GDP , taking it towards Swedish levels seen in the 1970s. Mr Biden’s formal proposals amount to just a 3% increase and in all probability he might get only half of that passed: so a spending increase of $3trn-4trn over ten years, worth 1-2% of GDP .

The burning priority will be a jumbo “recovery” bill of perhaps $2trn-3trn aimed at revving up the economy and meeting a key strategic priority, more green-tinged infrastructure spending (see chart 3). The latter could command some Republican support because it creates jobs, while also pleasing Mr Biden’s more climate-aware base. Short-term stimulus measures may include cash for state and local governments, a boost to unemployment benefits, a rise in the minimum wage to $15 an hour and further support for small companies.

The green infrastructure element might include upgrades to electricity grids and charging stations for electric cars. In order to cut emissions Mr Biden’s plan aims for power generation to be carbon neutral by the mid-2030s. He is keen to spend tens of billions of dollars a year on research and development into renewable-energy technologies and other areas such as 5G , with the aim of establishing an American edge to rival China’s. If the jumbo recovery bill goes well, there may be room for a Biden administration to pursue one other big legislative priority. One possibility is immigration reform. Another candidate is boosting middle-class social mobility, where Mr Biden proposes universal pre-school education, tax-credits for child care and free public-university education for families earning less than $125,000 a year. In total spending on an ambitious social-mobility agenda might amount to another $1trn over a decade.

Congress has only limited capacity so Mr Biden will also need to decide what not to do. He does not seem to have a burning appetite to reinvent Obamacare, which was not his first priority when vice-president (although like most politicians he wants to push down drug prices). He will have to hope that the Supreme Court does not force his hand: on November 10th it will begin considering the legality of Obamacare, which could unwind a system millions of people use. Were this to happen Mr Biden might be forced to try to legislate for a replacement. A push to modernise America’s decrepit antitrust apparatus, meanwhile, is on the backburner. Without new legislation, it will be hard to do much about the rising concentration of business or the big tech monopolies, given the courts are reluctant to take action. Kamala Harris, Mr Biden’s running-mate, was friendly towards tech as California’s attorney-general in 2011-17.

Tougher than the rest

Mr Biden’s proposals suggest that roughly half of his spending might be covered by tax rises. Once again the formal plan points to tax hikes of $4trn, but as with spending, in reality a figure half that size or less, of $1.5trn-2trn, is more likely. Big changes to social-security levies are probably off the cards since they are not eligible for the reconciliation process in the Senate. Many Democrats in Congress are wary of raising capital-gains tax too high. So business-tax rises will do much of the work with a partial reversal of the 2017 Trump tax cuts.

Mr Biden would raise the headline rate on corporate income from 21% to up to 28%, levy minimum taxes on foreign earnings and remove tax perks for real-estate and private-equity firms. Individuals earning more than $400,000 would see the top band of income tax rise to up to 39.6%, and those earning more than $1m might have to pay a capital-gains rate that is nearer the one they pay on their income.

A second way Mr Biden could influence the economy, and give licence to his party’s more radical impulses, is through job appointments. Yet it seems unlikely that he will appoint Ms Warren as treasury secretary, or even attorney-general. That would send an alarming signal to the business community when the economy is fragile. It would also trigger a special election to fill her Senate seat in Massachusetts. Instead the front-runners to become treasury secretary are centrists. They include Lael Brainard, a centre-left member of the Federal Reserve Board; Jeff Zients, a co-head of Mr Biden’s transition team; Sylvia Mathews Burwell, a former Obama official and Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former Fed governor and treasury official. If a business figure is needed then Ruth Porat, the finance chief of Alphabet, a tech giant, is also thought to be a contender.

Based on Mr Biden’s own experience as vice-president, in which he acted as a key counsellor to Mr Obama, Ms Harris would have an important voice in his administration. She sits to the left of him on tax and spending, although she is within the mainstream. And having rejected its signature policies and outmanoeuvred its star figures, Mr Biden might try to placate the left of his party by giving it lots of jobs in the regulatory apparatus where they would emit a cacophony of left-sounding signals.

The final tool Mr Biden has to get his way is executive orders, which Mr Trump and Mr Obama both used. Yet here, too, Mr Biden will be restricted by the courts which have become substantially more conservative than they were in the Obama era. Mr Biden would try to use this power to reverse some of Mr Trump’s own executive orders. Top of this list is probably the ban on some migrants and the president’s clampdown on refugees and undocumented workers that has intensified this year. The rules for visas for skilled workers would be eased. Yet despite his support for immigration, his stance on protectionism is more ambiguous, and here the president has sway and discretion. Mr Biden has been a free trader in the past and would certainly be politer to China than Mr Trump has been. He would rally America’s allies to put in place a co-ordinated response to deal with China’s economic model under Xi Jinping in which even notionally private Chinese firms are often acting under the strategic direction of the Communist Party.

But he will only go so far. This reflects a shift in public opinion. According to the Pew Research Centre, fully 73% of Americans now have an unfavourable view of China, a new high. Mr Biden would not quickly withdraw the tariffs that are now in place (the average tariff on goods imported from China is about 19%). While he has been critical of the Trump administration’s botched effort to rein in TikTok, a Chinese social-media app, he would probably stick with the embargo on Huawei and be wary of high-tech trade with China.

Similarly, new trade deals will not be a priority even though Mr Biden supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership and USMCA , the revised US -Mexico-Canada deal passed in 2020. (Ms Harris was opposed to both.) Mr Biden’s industrial strategy is laced with soft protectionism, including promises to bring supply chains back to home, adopt a “buy American” government-procurement policy, tighten rules on the labelling of products, use American steel for transport projects and singing the praises of the Jones Act which requires that only American-flagged ships carry goods between domestic ports.

A Biden presidency therefore promises moderately higher taxes and more spending, especially on green infrastructure, more industrial policy and not much change to trade policy. Who would benefit? In terms of individuals his policies are aimed squarely at the middle classes and lower paid who would benefit from a raft of measures such as cheaper education, perks to get on the housing ladder and a higher minimum wage. Mr Biden’s tax rises are squarely levied on the richest Americans: if fully enacted they would mean the income of the top 1% of earners would drop by 14%, and the income of the top 0.1% by 18%, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. In reality these proposals will not be passed in their entirety. Either way, the impact of the tax changes on the 99% would be minimal (see chart 4).

What about business? Which firms would gain and which would suffer? One estimate suggests corporate profits would fall by about 12% because of the tax rises. Investors have already begun to discount this and to bid up the shares of renewable-energy firms and construction and infrastructure companies which might benefit from a Biden presidency. The shares of fossil-fuel energy firms which might suffer under a Biden presidency have dropped. Tech stocks have soared this year even as the odds of a Biden win have risen, suggesting investors don’t worry about antitrust action against Silicon Valley. The stockmarket has risen by 4.5% this year despite the recession; hardly a sign of an imminent lurch towards big-state socialism. Even so, there would be risks to the economy from a Biden presidency. One is that he loses control of the party and there is a lurch even further to the left, spooking the business world. Were the Democrats to abandon the Senate filibuster, a path might be open to an expansion in the size of the Supreme Court or, some bosses fear, more radical legislation. But Mr Biden would probably resist this. More likely is that a regulatory apparatus stuffed with left-wing appointees ends up damaging his relationship with business. Many of the Trump administration’s most reckless regulatory decisions, for example its push since 2017 to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from limiting the use of coal, need to be reversed. The danger is that new rules are churned out in unco-ordinated fashion on unions, inequality and the like, accompanied by volleys of confrontational rhetoric. Democrats tend to think that business is just crying wolf. But small firms consistently complain about regulation, and badly designed rules after the financial crisis of 2008-09 helped cause serious problems in the mortgage market.

The second danger is fading dynamism. Some of Mr Biden’s agenda, including infrastructure and more research and development, will boost America’s long-term competitiveness. But a lack of antitrust policy and more red tape could continue to give too much power to large, incumbent companies, which have seen their market share rise in two-thirds of industries over the past two decades, creating oligopolies in industries from mobile telecoms to credit cards. The undercurrent of protectionism in Mr Biden’s plans could insulate the economy from competition abroad, sapping its vitality. Ultimately there exists a tension between Mr Biden’s desire to build new infrastructure quickly and cheaply and his plan to favour domestic workers and supply chains, that is likely to become far more acute over time. The final risk is America’s long-term fiscal position (see chart 5). Even after the covid-19 stimulus fades, and before any deficit-widening steps that the next president makes, America’s deficit was projected to soar above 5% of GDP in perpetuity, with public debt reaching about 200% of GDP by 2050. Today the Federal Reserve is buying much of the net new debt issuance by the government, as fiscal and monetary policy begin to merge.

For now this strange new fiscal regime seems sustainable. But over time the risk of the politicisation of the Fed will increase. And the economy and financial system will become vulnerable to any eventual rise in inflation. A debate over these risks looks likely to occur when the first term of Jay Powell, the Fed’s chairman, finishes in early 2022. But so far Mr Biden has no major plan for redesigning the macroeconomic architecture or for getting America’s long-term finances on a stable footing.

Better days

Mr Biden, a life-long pragmatist, looks likely to govern as one. Stylistically that means getting sensible advice, behaving consistently and working with America’s institutions. While he may lack a formal economic doctrine, his goal will be to get the economy out of its covid-19 slump, improve social mobility and build a better safety net. He will place his biggest bet on giving a long-term boost in infrastructure and climate policy, and then try to moderate the wilder forces swirling around America’s electorate and polity, including the more socialist ideas of the hard left, chauvinistic protectionism and the indifference of the right towards America’s social fabric. The claim that a Biden presidency would destroy American capitalism is silly. If he can restore competent management and make the economy work better for ordinary people Mr Biden’s last job in politics will be done. ■

At the sold-out event held at the Ent Center for the Arts and hosted by Pike Peaks United Way’s Public Policy Council, the two candidates answered questions on issues including law enforcement, growth, economy and education.

With three weeks until Election Day, the debate offered voters a view into each candidate’s comprehensive vision for the city and differing approaches after both previously listed the same top three campaign priorities: infrastructure, public safety and economic vitality.

“My vision for this city is that we become an inclusive, culturally rich, economically prosperous, safe and vibrant city on a hill for the world to see,” Mobolade said. “This is a long-range vision that has actionable steps over the next four years and I’ve been taking a look at each one of these areas and we’ll be leaning into them, forming a community coalition around each of these areas.”

“This is the city that I fell in love with and my vision for the future is that this continues to be the place that everyone who comes here, whether you’re a visitor or for a job interview, falls in love with our community again,” Williams said. “It is absolutely critical that we address these needs that I have focused my campaign on.”

Williams touted his longtime political experience to show how he plans to approach issues including crime and public safety. He referenced his appointment to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training board by Gov. Jared Polis and said this experience in public safety leadership would permit him to appropriately address the needs of law enforcement and firefighters in the city.

Mobolade said his efforts in public safety would focus on attrition issues and bolstering retention, rather than recruitment, based on concerns that he said have been brought to his campaign by the Colorado Springs Police Protective Association. “The problem is to boost morale. This is a workforce issue,” Mobolade said.

Mobolade, a political newcomer, outlined a plan to address affordable housing in Colorado Springs, first appointing a chief housing officer to directly report to him. As mayor, Mobloade said he would initiate new development conversations to bring down housing costs and prioritize diversifying city transportation with continued city growth.

Mobolade has experience as an entrepreneur, business leader and nonprofit founder. He is Colorado Springs' former Small Business Development administrator and co-founded restaurants Good Neighbors Meeting House and The Wild Goose Meeting House, as well as business consultant company Niche Coaching and Consulting. Mobolade also served as a ministry leader at First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs, according to his website.

Williams shared that he moved to Colorado Springs after a job offer gave him the choice between Denver and Colorado Springs in 1992; he called the decision an easy one. Now, he says he does not want Denver to interfere with decisions on local land use, citing many areas that the city should focus on to handle growth under his mayorship.

Williams most recently served as a member of the Colorado Springs City Council, where he worked with county representatives to make sure a voter-approved tax, which was extended for another 10 years in November, will help pay for upgrades to Marksheffel Road and Powers Boulevard.

Featured Local Savings

Williams is also a former El Paso County commissioner, clerk and recorder and Colorado secretary of state. When he was a county commissioner, he established the Pikes Peak Regional Transportation Authority that collects a 1-cent regional sales tax that funds transportation projects. As clerk and recorder, he said he created an office on Fort Carson for people to get things like licensing and election services taken care of.

""I've had the opportunity to actually deliver and create opportunities in this community,"" he said.

Both candidates also recognized city government's role in addressing homelessness.

Williams said there he would have a two-fold approach, the first by enforcing related ordinances like illegal camping, the second to work with and support nonprofits that provide resources to people who are unhoused.

Mobolade cited mental health as the root cause for a large percentage of people who are unhoused and expressed intentions to support mental health initiatives, in addition to wraparound care and increased outreach professionals.

A question from a student attending the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where the Ent Center is located, asked what these two candidates would do as mayor to entice local college graduates to either remain in the city or return for their careers. Both expressed an interest in connecting young professionals with job openings in the city.

Both candidates have children and shared plans to support public education as mayor. Mobolade pushed public safety in schools, sharing that this is an especially important topic for him because his oldest child at 9 years old is the same age as the three third graders killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville school last month.

Williams echoed public safety support with school resource officers. He also expressed a desire to support parents doing what is best for their child’s education, citing his own experience putting his four children through public school in Colorado Springs.

""Parents know best for their children and we should support that,” Williams said.

In the runoff, the candidate who earns a majority of votes, or more than 50% of votes cast, will be named mayor.

“A lot of people chose not to vote in that first election,” Williams said after around 35% of registered voters cast ballots in the municipal election on April 4.

“Please vote. Please recognize that whether or not you voted in the first election, you have that opportunity and responsibility to vote in this one.”

Aug 12 2020,Americans Express Mix of Concern and Hope on the Economy,Gallup,center,https://news.gallup.com/poll/309644/americans-express-mix-concern-hope-economy.aspx,"Story Highlights Seven in 10 continue to say U.S. economy is in recession or worse

Same level believe economic conditions are getting worse

Six-month outlooks for economic growth, stock market relatively upbeat

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Americans are concerned about the present state of the economy and believe conditions are worsening, but their six-month predictions for specific aspects of the economy are less dire -- particularly in terms of the stock market and economic growth.

Americans' Six-Month Outlook for Economic Metrics Over the next six months, do you think that each of the following will -- go up a lot, go up a little, remain the same, go down a little, (or) go down a lot? Total go up Remain the same Total go down % % % Net positive outlooks Stock Market 51 8 39 Economic Growth 48 10 42 Net negative outlooks Unemployment 49 6 44 Interest rates 40 25 32 Inflation 56 21 20 Gallup, April 14-28, 2020

Americans Tilt Optimistic About GDP and Stock Market

When asked about the trend in economic growth over the next six months, 48% of Americans think it will go up by a lot or a little while slightly fewer, 42%, think it will go down.

The April 14-28 poll was conducted just prior to the Commerce Department's April 29 announcement that the GDP fell by 4.8% in the first quarter. That merely confirmed weeks of reports that the economic shutdown resulting from COVID-19 was throttling the economy. Thus, many Americans may assume the economy can only improve by the fall, especially if states have reopened.

The same poll finds 51% of Americans thinking the stock market will go up a lot or a little over the next six months, while 39% predict it will go down. At the time of the poll, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had recovered about half its losses from the sharp downturn in March, perhaps fueling this optimism.

Even as the jobs rate is soaring, Americans' outlook for unemployment tilts negative, but not by much. About half, 49%, say unemployment will go up over the next six months while 44% say it will go down.

With federal interest rates near zero and nowhere to go but up, 40% of Americans think interest rates will go up in the next six months; 32% say they will go down. Another 25% predict interest rates will stay the same, the largest ""same"" reading for any of the economic aspects rated.

The public is most pessimistic about inflation, with 56% predicting an increase compared with 20% expecting it to decline.

Seven in 10 Americans Troubled by Today's Economy

Americans' ratings of the economy in general, which had quickly soured in the first month of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. between mid-March and mid-April, have since held steady at the reduced level.

Just prior to the Commerce Department's April 29 announcement that GDP fell by 4.8% in the first quarter, 72% of Americans in a Gallup Panel survey said the U.S. economy is now in a recession (42%) or depression (30%). That is similar to the 71% recorded the week prior, but up slightly from 66% at the start of the month.

Americans also hold a decidedly negative view of the direction in which the economy is going. In the latest Gallup telephone poll, 71% said conditions are getting worse rather than better, similar to the 74% interviewed April 1-14, which were the worst readings in Gallup's trend since the Great Recession.

At the start of the coronavirus outbreak in March, Americans were still divided on whether the economy was getting better or worse, whereas in January and February, optimism still prevailed.

Americans have quickly come to recognize that not only is the economy headed in a negative direction, but the current economy is ailing. About four in 10 adults in each Gallup telephone poll this month have rated economic conditions as ""poor,"" and another third have called them ""only fair.""

Meanwhile, the percentage saying the economy is in ""excellent"" or ""good"" condition has fallen to 23%, after plummeting from 54% in the first half of March to 27% in the first half of April.

While consumer optimism about the economy has plummeted since the start of the year amid low unemployment and record-highs in the stock market, Americans' ratings of the economy are not yet as negative as they were at their lowest in Gallup's trend.

In October 2008, at the start of the Wall Street economic crisis, only 5% of Americans rated the economy as excellent or good, 22% as only fair and 73% as poor.

And in June 2008, as the economic dark clouds leading up to that crisis were forming, 87% thought the economy was getting worse while just 7% said it was getting better.

The historical context thus suggests today isn't the worst of economic times in Americans' recent memory. On the other hand, it shows how much worse the public's mood can get. At the rate economic confidence declined in March, it could easily descend further in the coming months if bad news on unemployment and GDP continues to roll in.

Jul 23 2020,Next pandemic threat to economy: A wave of evictions,Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2020/0722/Next-pandemic-threat-to-economy-A-wave-of-evictions,"“They said they’re going to be sending out eviction notices at the first of the month,” he says. “I told them I’ll try – if I can set up a payment program.” For renters in Wisconsin and beyond, a lot now rides on discussions in Congress about a new round of coronavirus relief for the economy.

In Milwaukee, on the ninth floor of a downtown apartment building, Edward Smith was alarmed recently to get a notice that he owed more than $3,000 in rent. Mr. Smith, a disabled Army veteran and former paratrooper, says he fell so far behind because he had to pay funeral expenses for his father, who tested positive for the coronavirus.

Government aid for individuals during the pandemic was speedy but also limited in its duration. The expiration of eviction bans is a test of whether the U.S. will let a health crisis also become a housing crisis.

Some states have seen temporary bans on eviction expire, and this week a federal eviction moratorium affecting about one-quarter of America’s rental properties is set to end. An estimated 11 million or more U.S. households may face eviction in coming months.

Even in good times, 2 million or more households can face eviction in America in any given year. Low-income renters, especially, often scrape by on margins too narrow to absorb even modest difficulties. Now, the coronavirus pandemic, disrupting the income of legions, could create a tsunami of evictions.

The first of the month had come and gone, and now in early July the man with the clipboard arrived at the apartments on North Hopkins Street, a plain two-story brick building where grass and weeds grow scraggly along the street and broken furniture lies abandoned around the dumpster out back.

To tenants he was a figure of doom. On the second floor, he stuck a folded eviction notice in the door of Apartment 14, two units down from where Sorea Appling lived. It wasn’t long before Apartment 14’s tenant, and the woman in Apartment 5 downstairs, had found new places to live.

“They say once you get your door knocked on by the man with the clipboard, you might as well leave,” says Ms. Appling, a public school janitor who has been out of work since March and worries that she might be next.

Why We Wrote This Government aid for individuals during the pandemic was speedy but also limited in its duration. The expiration of eviction bans is a test of whether the U.S. will let a health crisis also become a housing crisis.

Her worries are increasingly shared by renters across the nation. For several months during the coronavirus pandemic a combination of tenant grit, landlord forbearance, and federal aid has helped people stay in their homes. State or local bans on evictions have in many cases offered a reprieve.

Now those eviction bans are phasing out along with key government support for unemployed workers. With the economy far from recovered, some of the steepest declines in income have been faced by low-income renters like Ms. Appling. By some estimates, the United States could see more than 11 million households evicted in the next four months.

“People are going to go over a cliff,” says Mary Cunningham, a housing expert at the nonprofit Urban Institute, and co-author of a new analysis on the problem. “We’ve seen this coming. We’ve been racing toward it with the clock running out and, so far, Congress hasn’t responded.”

Analogies like “cliff” or “tsunami” are apt. As the Senate convenes this week to consider new coronavirus relief, a key question is whether the resulting bill will include provisions to help at-risk renters. The expiring supports – from the CARES Act passed by Congress in April – include an eviction moratorium for the roughly one-quarter of rental properties that get federal backing, plus supplemental unemployment benefits that have so far buoyed up millions of households.

Although some states have moved to extend eviction bans, the potential for mass evictions on an unprecedented scale looms.

Economists say such an eviction wave could deepen poverty, widen racial inequality, and create severe new damage to the economy that will take years to repair.

“The issue of inability to pay, poverty, and unemployment – that existed pre-COVID-19,” says Raphael Ramos, a lawyer with Legal Action Wisconsin and head of its Eviction Defense Project. “The difference between now and then is that the pandemic has shifted the line of poverty. There are more people at risk than before.”

“Not in 40-hour jobs”

Indeed, the coronavirus is amplifying a problem that has long festered in Milwaukee and other cities. Housing advocates say evictions are a symptom of a combination of chronic problems like low-paying jobs, too little affordable housing, and public transportation systems that are inadequate to take people to where the work is. Renters often scrape by on margins too narrow to absorb even modest difficulties.

“A good part of our clients are not in 40-hour jobs, but in a patchwork of jobs – babysitter, bus driver, hair cutters,” says Peter Koneazny, litigation director at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, where calls from renters appealing for help have skyrocketed. “You have a lot of that. It’s a kind of constant struggle for many people. Their head is barely above water, most of them.”

Evictions are sometimes the result of cascading circumstances. Iyonna Hall-Davis was working as a certified nursing assistant in a Milwaukee suburb, often for 16 hours at a time, when she started having trouble with her car, an old 2007 Cadillac. Taking public transportation to work was “not an option,” she says. “No bus came near it.”

Her transportation troubles led her employer to cut her hours, and she fell behind on her rent, Ms. Hall-Davis says. At the end of February a payroll check that would have covered what she owed arrived late, forcing her eviction. She’s been struggling ever since, moving with her 3-year-old son among family and friends and waiting for her unemployment application to be acted on. She’s been waiting 10 weeks. She hopes to use the money to rent a new apartment and buy another car that can take her to work.

“Whenever that comes, I’ll get my life back together,” she says.

Options for Congress

To stave off the potential crisis, affordable housing advocates are pushing for one or more of the following from Congress: a comprehensive federal ban on evictions to replace the diminishing patchwork of protections currently in place, rental assistance for tenants affected by the pandemic, targeted help for landlords, continuation of the supplemental unemployment benefits at some level, and help for local governments, which are expected to be swamped by eviction notices once the moratoriums end.

Many of those provisions are in the HEROES Act, a $3 trillion package passed by House Democrats in May. Republicans in the Senate, however, say the Democrats’ measure is far too costly.

Some housing groups are optimistic Congress will act. “It’s brink negotiations,” says Bob Pinnegar, president and CEO of the National Apartment Association, which represents the rental housing industry. He expects an acceptable package will emerge.

Affordable housing advocates are more optimistic about local initiatives.

The “cancel rent” movement, for example, notched a victory recently when Ithaca, New York, passed a resolution calling on the state to cancel rent for residents and small businesses for three months.

Massachusetts is the latest state to renew a pandemic-related ban on evictions. Its moratorium, which had been set to expire in August, will now stretch through the fall, due to an order Tuesday by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.

In Wisconsin, by contrast, a two-month ban set by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers expired May 26. That month, the Republican-majority state Supreme Court threw out Governor Evers’ coronavirus order as unconstitutional and mandated that new policies go through a legislative rule-making process.

Mr. Ramos and others saw evictions in Wisconsin jump 40% over the previous year in the first week after the state eviction moratorium ended. They are now running 14% higher than last year.

“There are a lot of people in this building who are under the threat of eviction,” says Ms. Appling, a slender woman with close-cropped blond hair and a silver crucifix around her neck. “Ever since March, these people haven’t been able to go to work.”

For families, wide ripple effects

Eviction has big ramifications for families. It makes it much harder to rent from other landlords, pushes families into substandard and more crowded housing, and has been shown to have negative effects on everything from physical and mental health to education for children who have to move from school to school, says Emily Benfer, a law professor at Wake Forest University and co-creator of the COVID-19 housing policy scorecard set up by the Eviction Lab, a research project at Princeton University in New Jersey.

Pushing people into more crowded, substandard housing is problematic anytime. Doing it in the midst of rising coronavirus cases makes the potential health fallout much worse, says Ms. Cunningham of the Urban Institute. “It’s really reckless during a pandemic to have people lose their housing when we’re all trying to socially distance.”

Evictions already hit people of color disproportionately. In Boston, a report last month from City Life and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that in nonsubsidized housing, more than a third of evictions happened in predominantly Black neighborhoods, even though only 18% of the rental housing was in those neighborhoods. That’s partly a result of poverty and low income, the researchers said, but the most telling predictor was the neighborhood’s racial composition.

In the pandemic, people of color are more vulnerable because they’re more likely to work the low-wage jobs most at risk during the pandemic, such as hospitality and retail positions, where people can’t work from home. And it’s not clear how many of those service jobs will come back as the economic recovery shows signs of slowing.

Among Americans in general, the problem of eviction is huge, affecting about 2.3 million households in a year, according to the Eviction Lab. In the next four months, the figure could hit more than 11 million, according to a new data analysis tool by global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross LLC.

In Milwaukee, on the ninth floor of a downtown apartment building, Edward Smith was alarmed recently to get a notice that he owed more than $3,000 in rent. Mr. Smith, a disabled Army veteran and former paratrooper, says he fell so far behind because he had to pay funeral expenses for his father, who died in May at a nursing home in the Chicago suburbs. Mr. Smith says his father, who was 90, had tested positive for the coronavirus. “I had to help bury him,” he says.

Mr. Smith, a tall, friendly man who wears an American flag face mask, says he talked to the building’s management after receiving the letter. “They said they’re going to be sending out eviction notices at the first of the month,” he says. “I told them I’ll try – if I can set up a payment program.” But he’s worried. He’s applied for rental assistance.

Lifelines in a storm

Wisconsin is spending $25 million of federal COVID-19 relief money to help tenants avoid evictions. The problem is that many renters don’t know about the assistance. And housing advocates wonder what happens when the money runs out.

In the meantime, many small landlords, too, are on the financial brink, unable to withstand a long-term dive in rental income. Yet some have shown leniency because of COVID-19.

“The mom and pop landlords are doing what they can to keep good tenants,” says Lisa Owens, executive director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenant advocacy group in Boston.

Ms. Appling, the school janitor, was astonished to hear from a friend that another landlord had forgiven tenants a month’s rent. Moreover, many landlords know that tenants can apply for rental assistance. They are willing to wait. But not all landlords are so lenient, and as Ms. Appling has observed, evictions can happen suddenly and ruthlessly.

Jul 08 2020,Governors Reinstate Lockdowns To Combat Recovering Economy,Babylon Bee (Humor),right,https://babylonbee.com/news/governors-reinstate-lockdowns-to-combat-recovering-economy,"U.S. - Governors across the country have reinstated lockdowns mere weeks after slowly starting to lift them, citing a ""concerning spike"" in jobs and the economy.

Worried that the increase in jobs, prosperity, and happiness would hurt them in November, they reacted to the economic upturn quickly, shutting down businesses and locking people back in their homes.

""We can't let this economic spike continue,"" said California Governor Gavin Newsom. ""That would go against SCIENCE. The SCIENTISTS say that locking down an entire population is the best way to prevent dangerous economic spikes.""

""Also, we wanted to mention that this message was brought to you by PlumpJack Estate Winery. Use code NEWSOM for 10% off your next tasting!""

The governors noticed that people were happier with their lives, glad they could go back to work and reopen their businesses, and having fun outside. Unable to tolerate this kind of freedom and general satisfaction with life in the age of Trump, they scrambled to lock back down.

""We're seeing a concerning rise in the number of people disregarding the government and going on with their lives,"" said Governor Gretchen Whitmer. ""If you're outside enjoying yourself or contributing to the economy, I'll get you, my pretty! And your seeds too!"""
Dec 31 2016,"The economy in 2017? The trend is up, but not for everyone.",Christian Science Monitor,center,http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/new-economy/2016/1231/The-economy-in-2017-The-trend-is-up-but-not-for-everyone,"There are good reasons for optimism about the United States economy in 2017: Growth is steady, inflation is low, and more people are working.

Businesses are so eager for workers that 2017 might be the year when wages finally start growing robustly. President-elect Donald Trump is promising steep business tax cuts and fewer regulations.

No wonder the stock market is flirting with 20,000 on the Dow stock index and consumer confidence in November hit its highest level since before the Great Recession. If Mr. Trump can avoid trade wars with other nations, the economy looks set to shine next year, giving the new administration time for its proposed tax cuts and infrastructure stimulus to have an effectin 2018 or 2019.

“There is a lot of momentum building up into next year,” says economist Chris Christopher Jr., director of US and global consumer economics at IHS Markit, a business analytics firm.

Gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the nation’s output of goods and services, will grow a respectable 2.3 percent in 2017, according to IHS Markit. That’s not the great growth that Trump predicted during the presidential campaign, but it does represent a healthy bump from the estimated 1.6 percent rise in 2016.

But a few clouds appear on the economic horizon.

One is the strong US dollar, which is good for consumers when they buy French perfume, but bad for US companies that export goods and services to countries with weakening currencies, such as Japan, China, and members of the European Union.

Another cloud is rising long-term interest rates, which will make it more expensive for businesses and consumers to borrow money, according to David Payne, an economist at Kiplinger, a personal-finance and business-forecasting website.

“Any improvement for the consumer will be balanced out by the higher value of the dollar,” Mr. Payne forecasts.

A third potential problem is a trade war. Last week, CNN reported that the incoming administration was floating the idea of using an executive order to impose tariffs of up to 10 percent on imported goods as a way to encourage manufacturing at home.

Such moves would spark fierce resistance from the business community as well as many in Congress. Worryingly, it could also trigger similar responses from trading partners, putting a further brake on international trade, which is already slowing.

The conundrum facing manufacturing is real. Despite a growing economy, manufacturing and mining industries didn’t see much improvement in employment last year, a sign that economic growth is not spreading equally. “If you’re in a bifurcated economy ... it’s not broadly growing across the board; it’s spotty,” Mr. Christopher says.

Economists expect the unemployment rate to stay low, around 4.5 percent, and the labor market to tighten in 2017, which means wages and salaries should continue to rise. Payne projects that they will grow 3 percent next year. This could entice some people back into the labor market. The nation continues to have an unusually large contingent of Americans who have stopped looking for work, economists say.

While the widespread tax cuts, regulation rollbacks, and infrastructure spending promised by the new administration are expected to add more juice to the economy – though it’s arguable whether the benefits will be widespread – that likely won’t happen until 2018 and 2019, experts expect.

This is because the proposed, massive tax reform – the biggest since Ronald Reagan’s in 1986 – and other economic policies will take time for the administration and US Congress to implement.

One tax policy expert, Steven Rosenthal, projects that the cut in the capital-gains tax, which taxes investment income such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, could come as soon as spring 2017. The last three times the maximum capital gains rate was cut (1981, 1997, and 2003), Mr. Rosenthal found, Congress pushed the discount into effect in May or June, in some cases months before a law was enacted.

The reason, he explains, is that Congress worries that Americans will hold onto their assets until the law takes effect, stalling the market.

“Hold your assets to sell after spring,” advises Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Come spring, some people could save 7 percentage points on their capital gains tax, CNBC calculates."

US employers announced 13% more job cuts in 2022 than they did the year before, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The reductions were small; setting aside 2021, last year saw the fewest annual job cuts since CGC began tracking in 1993. Still, any tightening in the job market begins to tilt leverage back to employers, threatening a brief period of worker empowerment that gave rise to concepts like the Great Resignation, quiet quitting and a generation of professional workers who could supposedly spend their whole careers working from camper vans in Idaho.

There is one sector where the trickle has already become a flood. According to Challenger’s numbers, the tech industry in 2022 increased its announced job cuts by 649%, with the total of 97,171 amounting to the highest since the dot-com crash more than 20 years ago. This year doesn’t look any better. So far in January, Amazon.com Inc. has said it expects to lay off 18,000 people, Microsoft Corp. has announced 10,000 job cuts, and more than two dozen US-based tech companies including Coinbase, Flexport and Salesforce have said they’ll cut their workforce by 10% or more, according to the website layoffs.fyi, which has been tracking job cuts in the industry."

A severe drought has shrunk rivers, disrupting the region’s supply of water and hydropower and prompting officials to limit electricity to businesses and homes. In two cities, office buildings were ordered to shut off the air-conditioning to spare an overextended electrical grid, while elsewhere in southern China local governments urged residents and businesses to conserve energy.

The rolling blackouts and factory shutdowns, which affected Toyota and Foxconn, a supplier for Apple, point to the ways that extreme weather is adding to China’s economic woes. The economy has been headed toward its slowest pace of growth in years, dragged down by the country’s stringent Covid policy of lockdowns, quarantines and travel restrictions, as consumers tightened spending and factories produced less. Youth unemployment has reached a record high, while trouble in the real estate sector has set off an unusual surge of public discontent."

FED OFFICIALS WEIGH ENDING ASSET PURCHASES BY MID-2022

""While more people are getting vaccinated, the pace of vaccination has slowed,"" Powell explained. ""A couple of months ago, we were ahead of many other similar countries in vaccination. Now we're falling behind, and one result you're seeing is the current outbreak of the delta strain that we're seeing in some parts of the country.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 315 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered to date, with roughly 72% of U.S. adults receiving at least one dose and 61.8% fully vaccinated.

While acknowledging that people and businesses have been able to adapt during the pandemic, Powell warned COVID-19 is ""still casting a shadow on economic activity.""

""We can't declare victory yet on that,"" he added.

The comments came as Powell fielded questions from students and educators during a town hall covering basic information about the U.S. central bank and the importance of economics education.

Despite being forced to adapt to an upended world, Powell expressed hope that students would be able to turn the lessons learned from the pandemic into ""profound tools of change.""

""I hope this will cause you to think about how you want to make your mark, knowing that things do change and sometimes they change quickly,"" Powell said. ""This is an extraordinary time and I believe that it will result in an extraordinary generation as long as we continue to have extraordinary educators to guide them.

Jul 29 2021,U.S. economy surges past pre-pandemic level,CBS News (Online),left,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-economy-gdp-6-5-exceeds-pre-pandemic-level/,"U.S. economic output has surpassed its pre-pandemic level after growing rapidly in the April-to-June quarter, the government announced Thursday.

The nation's gross economic product — the sum of all goods and services produced in the American economy — grew at a robust annualized rate of 6.5% in the second quarter of 2021, as vaccinations and government aid unleashed spending, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday.

The quarterly figure was less than analysts had expected, but the economy was likely held back mainly by supply shortages in goods, components and labor.

""The Q2 GDP report marks a key milestone in the recovery as the US economy more than recouped the output lost during the coronavirus recession and likely reached peak growth,"" economists at Oxford Economics said in a research note.

The government report provides more confirmation that the economy has mounted a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, which caused the steepest—and shortest—economic contraction on record.

The nation's employers added 850,000 jobs last month, well above the average of the previous three months. And average hourly pay rose a solid 3.6% compared with a year earlier. Consumer confidence has reached its highest level since the pandemic struck in March 2020, with retail sales remaining solid as Americans shift their spending back to services — from restaurant meals outside the home and airline trips to local entertainment events and shopping sprees. Businesses are also showing renewed faith in the economy, with orders for manufactured goods pointing to solid corporate investment.

""The fundamentals for consumers and businesses are still very good,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial, who said he had so far seen no effects from a rise in confirmed cases of the Delta coronavirus variant.

Still, there are plenty of newly unemployed people seeking help. In a separate report Thursday, the government said that the number of Americans filing for first-time jobless assistance continued to decline. Some 400,000 people applied for unemployment benefits in the week ended July 24, a drop from the prior week.

The weekly applications have fallen more or less steadily this year after peaking at 900,000 in early January, but they remain high by historic standards. Before COVID struck the United States in March 2020, claims were coming in at about 220,000 a week.

As of mid-July, some 13.1 million Americans were receiving some type of unemployment benefits."

Enlarge this image toggle caption David Zalubowski/AP David Zalubowski/AP

The U.S. economy grew at a strong pace in the spring as the country emerged from the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. The question now is what happens next, especially as the delta variant continues to spread.

On Thursday morning, the Commerce Department reported gross domestic product grew 6.5% in the period between April and June from a year earlier as the rollout of vaccines spurred a surge in economic activity.

Although that was below forecasts of around 8% growth, it still marked the second-strongest period of growth since 2003, or after a 33.4% annualized surge in the July-September period of last year, when the pandemic led to intense volatility in the economy.

The second quarter's growth was also faster than the revised 6.3% growth registered in January-March.

""Consumer spending was very strong in the second quarter,"" says Jay Bryson, the chief economist at Wells Fargo. ""In general, you're looking at very, very strong growth.""

Compared against the previous quarter, the economy grew 1.6% in April-June.

Loading...

But GDP data is backward looking, and many analysts expect growth to have marked a peak. For the second half of the year, the pace of growth will likely slow down, even as it is likely to remain strong.

The question is how much the economy could slow. Here are four factors that could determine the path forward:

The delta variant and the here-we-go-again impact

The pandemic is clearly not over yet. The highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus is fueling a surge in cases around the U.S., and multiple municipalities have reinstated indoor mask mandates, including Los Angeles County and St. Louis.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week revised its guidance to recommend that some fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors if they live in areas with substantial or high transmission.

Although few people expect the type of economic impact we saw when the pandemic started last year, it remains a real concern, given that only about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated.

Some small-business owners and their employees are worried about a repeat of last year, when many were forced to shut down their stores.

Ethnie Grazette, who works at Duman Home in Brooklyn, N.Y., says the spread of the virus could upend what has been a few very good months for the shop, which sells bedding and towels.

""These last few months have been pretty good,"" Grazette says, smiling. ""I got a lot of customers coming in. They're spending money. It's good for me and the people to get out.""

""I'm worried about what might happen,"" she adds, however, remembering the anxiety and uncertainty during the first part of the pandemic. ""If this new variant makes us shut down again, it's going to put a lot of strain on the economy

High inflation: temporary or here to stay?

Another risk is inflation. Data this month showed consumer prices surged 5.4% in June from a year earlier, the highest increase in nearly 13 years.

On Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting, Chair Jerome Powell again maintained that these increases are a result of pandemic disruptions to the economy and will be short-lived or ""transitory.""

Others are not so sure. Some economists worry that inflation could prove harder to reverse if Americans and businesses start to expect that prices will be high — and act accordingly.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Spencer Platt/Getty Images Spencer Platt/Getty Images

Stores could raise prices, and consumers could stop buying certain things, for example.

Even if it proves temporary, high inflation is already weighing on businesses and their customers.

""Just because it is transitory — that is, caused by some dislocation of the pandemic — that does not mean it is not disruptive and extremely impactful to certain segments of the economy,"" says Constance Hunter, the chief economist at KPMG.

The big debate over workers in America

Perhaps no issue has split opinions more sharply than why some Americans have remained reluctant to return to work, hindering some sectors like leisure and hospitality.

Republicans have consistently blamed the enhanced unemployment benefits passed during the pandemic. They say the benefits are a disincentive to work, and about half of states — almost all led by Republican governors — are ending the benefits early.

The data so far has been inconclusive, and analysts cite a number of reasons that some Americans have stayed on the sidelines, including health concerns, difficulty finding child care and, yes, the financial cushion provided by expanded benefits.

Ralph Elia owns KC Arts in Brooklyn, and he says it has gotten harder for him to find workers.

""I feel like small business has been in competition to get employees with the benefits,"" Elia says. ""I agreed with it in the beginning. We really needed it. But at some point, they should have slowed it down or cut it off. Because we need to hire people. People need to get out and work.""

Chips and the supply chain chaos

It's a problem that has bedeviled industries from carmakers to homebuilders since last year: A surge in demand from people cooped up at home has led to shortages of key materials, such as chips used in all kinds of electronics and cars, as suppliers struggle to keep up.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Roberson/AP Jeff Roberson/AP

Though some of the supply chain constraints are starting to ease — in the lumber sector, for example — there's no certainty of when global trade will approach normality.

So far the impact has been manageable overall, though much depends on how long the shortages of key materials last.

""If there will be any drag on growth in the second quarter, it could be from inventory,"" says Bryson, of Wells Fargo. ""[There are] lots of supply constraints, businesses can't produce as much and so, because of that, they may have been selling out of their inventory, and that could be a mild headwind to growth."""

Nov 10 2022,Inflation holds grip on US economy in October as prices remain stubbornly high,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/inflation-holds-grip-us-economy-october-prices-remain-stubbornly-high,"Inflation cooled more than expected in October, but consumer prices remained near a multi-decade high, continuing to squeeze millions of U.S. households and small businesses.

The Labor Department said Thursday that the consumer price index, a broad measure of the price for everyday goods including gasoline, groceries and rents, rose 0.4% in October from the previous month. Prices climbed 7.7% on an annual basis.

Those figures were both lower than the 8% headline figure and 0.5% monthly increase forecast by Refinitiv economists, a potentially reassuring sign for the Federal Reserve as it tries to tame runaway inflation with a series of aggressive interest rate hikes. It marked the slowest annual inflation rate since January.

In another sign that suggests underlying inflationary pressures in the economy are starting to slow, core prices – which strip out the more volatile measurements of food and energy – climbed 0.3% in October from the previous month, down from 0.6% in September. From the same time last year, core prices jumped 6.3%.

Economists anticipated that core prices would climb 0.5% on a monthly basis and 6.3% from the previous year.

Stocks rallied on the better-than-expected report, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbing more than 700 points. The S&P 500 jumped 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite surged more than 4.5%.

""Inflation slowing to its lowest annual rate since January is news that both the Fed and investors can get behind,"" said Mike Loewengart, the head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley. ""But remember that even as we see a slowdown, prices remain elevated and have a long way to go before normalizing.""

The report showed that used car prices tumbled last month, as did the cost of clothing, medical care and airline tickets. But even with the slowdown in inflation, prices remain well above the Fed's 2% target.

Scorching-hot inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent. The burden is disproportionately borne by low-income Americans, whose already-stretched paychecks are heavily impacted by price fluctuations.

Other price gains proved persistent and stubbornly high in October: The cost of groceries climbed 0.5%, putting the 12-month increase at 12.4%. Consumers paid more for items like cereal, bread, fresh fish and seafood, eggs and fresh vegetables, including tomatoes and lettuce.

THE FED'S WAR ON INFLATION COULD COST 1M JOBS

Shelter costs, which account for about 40% of the core inflation increase, rose 0.7% for the month and are up 6.9% over the past year, the fastest annual increase since 1982.

Rent costs jumped 0.8% over the month and 7.5% on an annual basis. Rising rents are a concerning development because higher housing costs most directly and acutely affect household budgets. Another data point that measures how much homeowners would pay in equivalent rent if they had not bought their home, climbed 0.7% in October from the previous month.

With food and shelter costs continuing to march higher, U.S. households are facing increased financial pressure. Average hourly earnings actually declined 0.1% in October on an inflation-adjusted basis. Compared with the previous year, earnings are down 2.8%, according to a separate BLS report.

The report will have significant implications for the Federal Reserve , which has embarked on one of the fastest tightening paths in decades. Policymakers have already approved six straight rate hikes, including four back-to-back 75-basis-point increases, and have shown no signs of slowing down.

""We still have some ways to go,"" Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters last week. ""And incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected.""

Still, the cooler-than-expected October inflation report has buoyed investor hopes that the central bank will pivot to smaller rate increases beginning in December. More than 80% of traders are now pricing in a 50 basis point rate increase in December, rather than a larger 75-basis-point hike, according to the CME Group, which tracks trading.

""The October CPI reading encouragingly came in lower-than-expected, supporting the likelihood that the Fed dials back the size of the next rate increase to 50 basis points in December,"" said Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic. ""However, one month’s results do not constitute a trend and the still elevated inflation rates will keep the Fed in a hawkish mindset."""

It means showering at the YMCA to save on her hot water bill.

In just a few weeks, the novel coronavirus outbreak has changed the way thousands of companies operate in an unprecedented manner. As business owners and employees navigate the new normal, here are some of the ways they have adapted to stay operating amid a global pandemic.

The COVID-19 outbreak has delivered an indiscriminate blow to businesses as everything from small restaurants to multinational corporations have been forced to change how they do work amid a series of shutdown orders to help stem the tide of the virus. They have also had to implement these massive organizational changes in just a matter of weeks to attempt to stay afloat -- with many companies shifting to full-scale working from home plans and others going all in on delivery.

""I’ve done a couple of webinars with groups of companies. As of about a week and a half ago they weren’t doing anything, there wasn’t anything different,"" Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and the director of Wharton's Center for Human Resources, told ABC News.

While many companies have adapted to the new realities of a pandemic economy, Cappelli predicts, ""the big test will come when it goes on for more than a couple of weeks.""

Some industries, like airlines, have not been able to find their footing as ridership has plummeted amid the crisis, leading them to project massive losses. And millions of workers have already filed for unemployment, even as companies scramble to hire workers to accommodate the new realities of the socially distanced and increasingly delivery economy.

""Right now, I think companies are getting a lot out of the good citizenship of their employees,"" he added.

Moreover, in recent months, Cappelli said there has been a shift in the way employers regard their workers, and it has been in vogue for business leaders to refer to employees as ""stakeholders"" not just workers. Cappelli predicts this health crisis is one of the first obstacles to put that to the test.

So far, ""we’ve seen more companies carrying employees for longer than expected if this had been a financial downturn versus a health-related one,"" he said.

Teleworking takes over everything from meetings to yoga classes

Social-distancing measures and government-mandated stay-in-place orders have led to entire companies moving their workforce to working from home, leading to a skyrocketing demand for video conferencing software such as Zoom.

""The world is not going to be the same as it was in December,"" Janine Pelosi, Zoom's chief marketing officer, told ABC News. ""Where that levels out, none of us really know. But working remotely, and using video conferencing, is not going to go away. If anything, I think it will speed up the adoption of these technologies.""

In addition to being used for meetings, workers in the health and fitness sector have also used the software to stream live workout or yoga classes. Teachers have also turned to the platform for remote learning lessons.

Amy Smith, a yoga instructor at Laughing Buddha Hot Yoga in West Deptford, New Jersey, said she is doing live, online yoga classes seven days a week amid the outbreak.

""I do them on Zoom then upload them on YouTube then link them to MINDBODY to get to as many platforms as we can get on,"" she told local ABC News affiliate WPVI.

While she expressed worry for the fate of her business, she said she is currently doing her classes online for free.

""I will not charge for this and I want people to have access to this now more than ever,"" Smith said. ""People don't have money to do yoga, they may be struggling to get money for dinner.""

Pelosi said she has heard of the platform being used ""for weddings, funerals and bar mitzvahs"" in the aftermath of many ""shelter-in-place"" ordinances.

Restaurants and delivery

The same new directives that are forcing thousands to work from home have led to a sharp uptick in demand for delivery services, especially in the food and grocery sector.

While the coronavirus-induced economic crisis has led to skyrocketing unemployment numbers, we've seen ""delivery companies booming,"" Cappelli said. Many also announced they are hiring hundreds of thousands of workers while other companies are facing mass lay-offs.

Instacart announced late last week it plans to hire a whopping 300,000 additional full-time shoppers over the next three months to meet the increased demand.

Amazon similarly said it will hire 100,000 full and part-time positions at fulfillment centers and delivery networks across the U.S. Pizza delivery giants Pizza Hut, Domino's and Papa John's also said they are hiring.

A handful of places including New York City have also mandated restaurants and other gathering-places such as bars only do take-out services for the time being.

Dawn Kelly, a small-business owner who runs the Nourish Spot restaurant in Queens, said everything about how they do business has changed amid the outbreak.

""I'm not letting people in,"" she told ABC News. ""We’re serving people pretty much at the door.""

""We keep the door locked, we go to the door and we give them their food from behind the door with gloves on,"" she added. ""Same thing with our delivery app drivers, we’re not letting them in, they are showing us their phone through the window.""

Photos of business across the country setting out social distancing rules for takeout customers with signs or chalk have also inundated social media.

It's not just in urban areas. In western Pennsylvania, demand for a delivery ""milkman"" has come back, according to one local dairy farmer.

""It's been a crazy uptick in interest,"" said Jeff Brunton, of Brunton Dairy in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, told local ABC News affiliate WTAE, describing the new demand as ""like a tidal wave.""

""It allows you to stay in-home or in your neighborhood, and not have to worry about being amongst the crowds and touching dirty shopping carts,"" he added.

He said he even teamed up with other local businesses to help deliver beef, bacon, butter and more as social-distancing becomes the norm.

Grocery and retail

As grocery and retail stores also adjust to the new reality, some have also made major changes amid the health crisis.

Dollar General, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods and more have announced special hours for older shoppers, the most at-risk group to serious complications from COVID-19.

Walmart's executive vice president of corporate affairs, Dan Bartlett, said the biggest impact on the outbreak to their more than 4,800 stores has been ""how our associates are coming together and doing heroic work.""

""The care they're putting into serving our communities is amazing,"" he said.

But it's no longer business-as-usual.

As for how business has changed, Bartlett said they have reduced hours to allow for deep-cleanings of the store, upped the availability of hand sanitizer and disinfectant-wipe stations and installed new ""sneeze-guard"" glass at pharmacy and checkout and more.

""Associates clean carts with cleaning kits as well,"" he added. ""We're installing clear plexiglass, sometimes there called sneeze guards. Buffets use them a lot, to prevent the spread of germs. We're rolling them out in pharmacy lanes and checkout lanes.""

Bartlett says they currently do not have a maximum occupancy limit for shoppers entering the stores, but said, ""We're installing signage to all of the stores to promote social distancing."""
Jan 25 2016,OPINION: What the economy needs now,Guest Writer - Right,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/stephen-moore-what-the-economy-needs-now/,"OPINION:

Everyone’s blaming the oil price collapse and China’s sliding economy, for the rout of the stock market these first two weeks of 2016. That’s part of the story, but there may also be a policy explanation for the bearish sell-off.

Call it the Bernie Sanders effect. In the Democratic presidential primary debate last week between Hillary and Bernie, the race was on to see which could raise taxes and punish businesses more. While Hillary was touting her income tax surcharge on millionaires that could raise income taxes to near 50 percent (and her capital gains tax hike), Sen. Sanders said that a 90 percent tax rate might be too high, but somewhere approaching that number is the target he’d shoot for. Bernie also talks about breaking up the banks, putting Wall Streeters in jail, a single-payer health care plan to the left of Obamacare, and adding trillions of new government spending.

This isn’t blossoming investor confidence. Was it just coincidence that polls that show Bernie surging into a widening lead against Hillary in New Hampshire and even beating several Republicans in a head-to-head competition were released the same day the stock market took another nose dive.

But for the umpteenth time: Where is the Republican growth message? The economy is sputtering clearly with corporate profits and business investment weakening and consumer spending slowing down as well. The GOP runs the House and Senate, but still no sign of a growth package to offer up a contrasting vision from the Bernie and Hillary show. Too many in the GOP have bought into the Chamber of Commerce unwise idea that funding the Export-Import Bank is a stimulus.

If the economy does sink into negative territory this year, the Democrats will surely demand more infrastructure spending, unemployment assistance, job training and a panoply of “stimulus” budget busters that didn’t work in 2009 and won’t work now. The Republican response to this nonsense should be short and sweet: been there. Done that.

What could be done right now to stimulate growth, investment and investor confidence almost immediately? The answer is a business tax rate reduction. Pass a rate cut to 15 percent, with full capital expensing and a 5 percent voluntary repatriation tax on the $2 trillion owned by U.S. multinational firms that is parked abroad to avoid the high corporate tax.

This won’t cost the Treasury much in lost revenues, and who knows? It may raise money over five years through the money and businesses repatriated back to America. Apple and GE might bring back tens of billions of dollars for assembly plants and research centers on these shores.

The current U.S. rate of 35 percent (federal) is the highest of all the nations we compete with. The rest of the world is at a rate closer to 25 percent with some nations like Ireland as low as 12.5 percent. Let’s go from the highest rate in the world to one of the lowest and see what happens to capital flows.

We know the 35 percent rate is an economic Get Out of Town and Do Not Stop at Go card. We have seen companies like Burger King, Medtronics. Pfizer, and dozens more leave the United States. In search of lower tax rates. More companies will scamper out if this isn’t fixed — and they take jobs with them.

Liberals like to pretend that the U.S. tax rates aren’t chasing out businesses and jobs, but then why are all the nations we compete with slashing their rates. The international average has come down from almost 40 percent in 1990 to 25 percent today. For two and a half decades the U.S. rates haven’t budged, while the rest of the world keeps chopping. We’re like a 6th grader who stops growing and then goes out and tries to play competitive basketball with 20 year olds over six feet tall.

Study after study tells us that the corporate tax at 35 percent is a loser. The American Enterprise Institute has found that wages rise much slower, if at all, in nations with high corporate tax rates. This happens because of less investment in the high tax nations, which means lower paying jobs. In other words, it’s not rich fat cat shareholders, but working class Americans who suffer the most.

Even President Obama’s own tax reform commission, headed by former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker found “deep flaws” in the corporate tax. It concluded that the corporate tax “acts to reduce the productivity of American businesses and American workers, increase the likelihood and cost of financial distress, and drain resources away from more valuable uses.”

As for the stimulus value of our proposed business tax cut, the Tax Foundation finds that immediate expensing and cutting the business tax rate are the best short-term strategy for generating more growth. Here is how the Foundation put it: “A cut in the corporate tax rate would have large effects on GDP, but minimal effects on federal revenue in the long run.” Nothing else has this kind of big bang for the buck payoff. By the way, for those Keynesians out there stuck on the demand side, tax rebates and credits, produce almost no positive feedback.

Republicans are preparing their budget plan this week. They should use a process that President Reagan used called Reconciliation to make room for a corporate tax cut jobs stimulus. This means the Republicans in the Senate will need only 51 votes to pass it once the House does so by a wide margin. We can imagine several Democrats in red states joining the GOP for this growth stimulus.

If Mr. Obama vetoes such a bill, austerity Democrats will pay a high price in November.

We’re all for a sweeping tax reform in 2017 and perhaps a flat tax with a Republican president in office. But it’s time for a tax cut down payment. Cut the corporate tax now.

Aug 03 2022,Pelosi’s Taiwan trip could have significant consequences for global economy,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/aug/03/nancy-pelosi-taiwan-global-economy-us-china,"Relations between the US and China were poor even before the visit of the House of Representatives speaker to Taiwan. Now they have the potential to turn very nasty indeed – with significant consequences for the global economy.

At the moment, things look containable. Financial markets have responded relatively calmly to Nancy Pelosi’s visit and the military exercises that Beijing has ordered in response. The assumption is that China will put on a show of strength and leave it at that.

However, its president, Xi Jinping, also has economic and financial weapons at his disposal and may choose to use them. At the milder end of the spectrum, China could make it more difficult for US companies to access its market. It will be in no hurry, for example, to allow Boeing to resume sales of its 737 Max planes.

This would accelerate the decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies – a trend that began when Donald Trump was in the White House and has continued under Joe Biden. Hostility towards Beijing is one of the few things Republicans and Democrats agree on.

There is the risk, though, that China could go further and exploit Taiwan’s dependence on imported fuel by imposing a blockade on the island. As Mark Williams, the chief Asia analyst for Capital Economics, notes, this would soon cripple Taiwan’s industry and cause “huge global economic disruption”.

That is because the island manufactures roughly half the world’s semiconductors, used in everything from mobile phones to cars and already running short. Restricting the export of chips would lead to supply bottlenecks, higher inflation and weaker growth. Inevitably, there would also be pressure on the US not only to impose economic sanctions and asset freezes but to intervene militarily as well.

Financial markets are probably underestimating the risks posed by Taiwan. At the very least, business confidence is going to take a fresh hit. The chances of tit-for-tat trade restrictions have increased. There will be more pressure for national self-sufficiency to reduce dependency on global supply chains.

And that’s a relatively optimistic reading of events. There is clearly a risk – low but non-negligible – of this increasingly tense cold war turning hot.

Oil prices appear to have further to fall

View image in fullscreen Opec no longer wields the influence over global energy markets it had in the 70s and 80s. Photograph: Dado Ruvić/Reuters

There was a time when meetings of the oil cartel Opec were front-page news. When Sheikh Ahmed Yamani died last year, the obituaries made much of how, as Saudi Arabia’s petroleum minister, he was a pivotal figure in determining the global price of crude.

But that was all a long time ago. Opec is now Opec+ thanks to the addition of some new members, including Russia, but it no longer wields the influence over global energy markets it had in the 1970s and 80s.

Oil prices are now well down on the levels they reached in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and will probably fall further in the coming months. That has nothing to do with Wednesday’s meaningless decision by Opec+ to increase the supply of crude by 100,000 barrels a day and everything to do with global demand.

As the International Monetary Fund noted last week, all three of the world’s major economies – the US, the eurozone and China – are stalling. Oil is trading at about $100 a barrel – a price consistent with strong global growth rather than the recession that is looming this winter.

Whether or not Opec+ adds to the downward pressure by increasing production, oil prices look to have further to fall. That will be good news for UK motorists, provided of course the lower costs are passed on to them by the petrol retailers.

Why regional pay for public sector workers is a duff idea

Setting up regional pay boards to match the pay of public sector workers to local labour market conditions is the sort of proposal Liz Truss might have dreamed up when she was cutting her political teeth as the deputy director of the centre-right thinktank Reform.

Nothing wrong in that. Thinktanks are there to come up with radical new proposals. Politicians, though, have to separate the good ideas from the duff ones, and regional pay for public sector workers falls squarely into the latter category.

There are reasons for that. One is that cutting public sector pay would reduce spending power in parts of the country that suffer from low levels of demand. Another is the need to provide incentives for the brightest and the best to take up jobs outside London and the south-east. The proposal is bad economics and bad politics, which jars with the government’s levelling up agenda. No wonder Truss dropped the idea within 24 hours of announcing it."
Mar 08 2020,"Just How Good Is Trump's Economy, Anyway?",Reason,right,https://reason.com/2020/03/08/just-how-good-is-trumps-economy-anyway/,"If Donald Trump has his way in November's presidential election, he'll coast to victory on the strength of the economy.

The U.S. job market, President Trump tweeted in September, currently has its ""all time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women."" Those numbers, which only grew stronger in the final months of the year, followed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the 2017 law that Trump has, with typical hyperbole, described as ""the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history.""

Even as the president faced a trial in the U.S. Senate, the stock market was up, unemployment was down, and average families were earning more than ever before. The week the Senate held its final vote in the impeachment trial, he delivered a State of the Union address that opened with an extended brag about the strength of the nation's economy, which he called ""the best it has ever been."" That is why Trump's 2020 campaign message can be condensed into a single tweet: ""How do you impeach""—or in the electoral case, beat—""a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country?""

For his Democratic rivals, the answer is to downplay the economy's gains or to deny its strength altogether. At one Democratic primary debate last year, candidates were asked what they would say to a voter who dislikes Trump but likes his economy. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) rejected the premise, saying that for ordinary people, the economy ""ain't great."" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) dismissed economic gains as a ""rise in corporate profits"" that are ""not being felt by millions of families across the country."" Former Vice President Joe Biden insisted, ""The middle class is getting killed. The middle class is getting crushed.""

In the run-up to the 2020 election, then, even the economy has become a partisan issue. As Amber Wichowsky, a political scientist at Marquette University who has studied how economic issues affect voters' political views, recently told The New York Times, ""Partisans have a strong desire to interpret the economy in a way that benefits their 'team.'""

Yet there are real, nonpartisan answers to be found in the countless economic data points that paint a picture of America's economic health. And those data tell us that in many respects, the state of our economy is strong in ways that can be attributed to Trump administration policies. The stock indices are at historic highs. JPMorgan Chase predicts another 8 percent increase in the value of the S&P 500 in 2020 as the economy ""reaccelerates."" Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Research forecasts steady U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 2.3 percent through this year.

At the same time, the economy has notable weaknesses—some of which are a product of Trump's actions as well. In short, neither simple partisan narrative tells the full story.

Jobs

The job situation under Trump is a clear success. The unemployment rate just hit a 50-year low, real wages are up, and job creation looks good—especially when compared with expectations. In its latest forecast before the 2016 election, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that the economy would add 1.9 million jobs in the next three years. In fact, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the first 35 months of the Trump administration saw the economy add almost 6.7 million jobs, beating the forecast by more than 350 percent.

That figure should be kept in perspective. As it happens, during the same period in President George W. Bush's second term, the economy gained 6 million jobs. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, during the first 35 months of President Barack Obama's second term, the economy added 6.8 million jobs.

Overall, though, Trump's numbers are very good, especially considering that the economy is in its 11th straight year of expansion. That's no small achievement: The longer an expansion lasts, the harder it is to add jobs. And during the last 50 years, the economy has experienced a contraction, on average, every seven years. Under Trump, this run of economic expansion has lasted far longer than is typical.

Taxes and Trade

These strong numbers have prompted many to declare the 2017 TCJA, which slashed tax rates for individuals and corporations while increasing the deficit by an estimated $1.5 trillion over a decade, an unmitigated success.

Although it was unwise to lower taxes without significantly cutting spending, the legislation itself was probably positive on net—particularly its reduction of America's unusually high corporate tax rate. Defenders, however, made a mistake by framing the tax cut as a major relief for the middle class.

The middle class wasn't and still isn't shouldering very much of the income-tax burden: Most income taxes are paid by higher-income earners. In 2013, the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest-earning 10 percent of the population was roughly 70 percent, while the share of federal income taxes paid by the bottom 90 percent of income earners was about 30 percent, according to research from the Tax Foundation based on IRS data.

In addition, other key provisions of the law—like doubling the standard deduction and adding new tax credits for the middle class—were never likely to provide much economic boost.

A more promising approach to producing growth would have been to pair the corporate tax reduction from 35 percent to 21 percent with a provision allowing firms to immediately write off the cost of new equipment. In theory, those changes would spur investments, causing wages over time to rise. At the time, however, conservative advocates for the tax cuts argued that reductions in the individual side were necessary to get the support necessary to pass such large corporate tax relief. The corporate tax cuts were viewed as politically impossible without some reduction for the middle class.

It didn't work out that way. As American Enterprise Institute's James Pethokoukis recently wrote, ""The Trump tax cuts are looking like failed politics. They're not popular, polls suggest, and most people don't think they got a tax cut.""

One possible reason for the disappointing public reaction: dramatic predictions made by many proponents that couldn't possibly hold up. For example, Trump surrogates and other supporters said the TCJA would, among other things, produce annual economic growth from 3 percent to 6 percent, boost average household incomes by at least $4,000 a year, and pay for themselves by increasing revenues overall. They also often implied that the impact would be immediate. The optimism was reinforced when a number of firms announced bonuses and higher pay initiatives shortly after the passage of the tax reform.

Compared with the administration and its boosters, most economists and investors had much more modest expectations for the TCJA. They knew that it would take time for the corporate tax cut to deliver growth and wage increases and that the payoff might become visible only months or years down the road. That's because the best case for the corporate tax cuts was never that companies would use their extra cash in the short term to raise workers' wages, extend paid leave, or offer other employee benefits. Nor was it that they would suddenly add many more workers to their payrolls.

The real case for the corporate tax cut was more subtle: Lowering marginal tax rates on investment gives companies an incentive to earn more taxable income, thus leading them to invest in other businesses as well as in upgrading and expanding their facilities. This additional investment, in turn, raises workers' productivity and ultimately leads to higher wages. But it's a process that takes time.

Nearly two years later, we can start to look back and determine if any of these things have happened. The U.S. economy definitely grew—but not at the 3 percent (or more) annual rate predicted by the administration. In 2018, the year after the TCJA was adopted, the economy grew by 2.9 percent. This was an improvement from 2016 and 2017 but roughly in line with 2014 and 2015. We don't yet have final numbers for 2019, but GDP growth is expected to be around 2.2 percent, giving an average growth rate of 2.5 percent for Trump's first three years in office—similar to the first three years of Obama's second term.

How much of the growth in output can be attributed to the tax cuts? Most estimates suggest that in 2018, the TCJA increased GDP by 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent, while the CBO projects that the increase will be 0.6 percent for 2019.

When it comes to investment growth, assessing the impact of the law gets more complicated. But the answer matters a great deal, since a boost in investment is one of the main channels by which the tax reform was supposed to deliver economic and wage growth.

As it turns out, investment did accelerate significantly in 2018. Wages also grew by 3 percent—a boost that mostly benefited workers at the bottom of the income distribution. Yet that's a far cry from the 7.8 percent wage growth that would have been needed in order for the TCJA to deliver on its promise of a $4,000 increase in average household income, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Moreover, the investment uptick didn't last. Data from the Federal Reserve of St. Louis Research Division show that capital investment growth has been falling since fall 2018. Correlation is not causation, so this doesn't mean that the tax cuts are the reason investment fell. But it does raise some doubt about claims that the cuts would cause a significant increase in investment—an outcome that proponents of the corporate tax cut, including me, predicted.

Several things could be going on. First, it's worth noting that in both pre– and post–tax cut forecasts, business investment had been projected to slow down. In other words, investment in 2018 was beating the forecast. So this could simply be a return to the predicted trend. Second, the growth in capital expenditures could be taking longer than expected to materialize. Third, the effects of the tax cuts on investments could be undercut by non-TCJA factors, such as lower oil prices or the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX airliners.

Another strong countervailing force, of course, could be the president's trade war. According to the Tax Foundation, the tariffs have reduced long-run GDP by 0.26 percent. The erratic announcements of tariffs, the resulting increase in costs for many American producers, and the predictable retaliation by foreign governments all slowed global growth and negatively affected business confidence in 2019. In turn, many companies were obliged to freeze projects or to defer investment plans. One recent study from the Federal Reserve found that any benefits U.S. manufacturers might have gained from reduced foreign competition were probably canceled out by the effects of retaliatory tariffs abroad and more expensive goods at home.

In other words, without the TCJA, the trade war—which has produced a recession in manufacturing—would almost certainly have dampened capital expenditures even further than it did.

Debt and Deficits

Trump's trade war isn't the only policy this administration has pursued with the potential to moderate or cancel out the beneficial effects of the 2017 tax cuts. Overspending is another.

In 2016, right before Trump took office, federal spending was $3.9 trillion. Two years later, that number had risen to $4.1 trillion. During the same period, the federal deficit grew from $585 billion to almost $1 trillion—with trillion-dollar deficits expected to continue for years to come. Total expenditures for this year include at least $28 billion in bailout payments to farmers to make up for the pain inflicted by the trade war.

The president is not fully responsible for this spending frenzy; Congress has failed to abide by its own budget processes for years and has made a series of bipartisan deals to raise both domestic and military spending. But Trump's utter lack of interest in fiscal discipline—including repeatedly declaring that he won't touch Social Security and Medicare, the biggest long-term drivers of the federal debt—seems to have encouraged Republicans in Congress, who were happy enough to overspend anyway, to completely abandon any pretense of fiscal responsibility.

All of this fueled an expansion in the federal debt from $19 trillion at the beginning of 2016 to $22 trillion at the end of 2018. It's unclear how big a toll this red ink has taken on the economy, but I am quite certain it has had one. In the wake of the financial crisis, economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff published a paper called ""Growth in a Time of Debt,"" which concluded that when gross debt as a share of GDP increases beyond 90 percent, economic growth slows. The paper was widely cited among commentators, academics, and politicians in the debate surrounding austerity and fiscal policy in debt-burdened economies. Unfortunately, some data errors allowed skeptics to discredit Reinhart and Rogoff's findings.

A recent review of the literature, however, reveals that high government debt ratios do have negative effects on economic growth rates. The question of how much growth is lost from higher debt remains a matter of debate. But there's little doubt that over time, carrying large amounts of public debt has damaging economic effects.

Deregulation

What about deregulation? In his first week in office, Trump issued Executive Order 13771, titled ""Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs,"" which requires that ""for every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.""

The White House claims that ""under the President's leadership, the Administration has cut 8 and a half regulations for every new rule, far exceeding his promise to cut two regulations for every new one."" The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) estimates that after five to 10 years, this new approach to federal regulation will have raised real incomes by $3,100 per household per year.

This sort of claim is hard to check, and it seems overly optimistic. Still, Federal Register data compiled by the Center for Regulatory Studies at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where I work, reveals that the total number of federal regulations has indeed stalled in recent years.

That is a positive trajectory compared to the Obama administration. Yet simply counting the rules doesn't fully capture their impact. The number of economically significant regulations is growing more today than it did under President Ronald Reagan. It may be that the Trump administration picked the low-hanging fruit in 2017 and 2018 and has now reached its deregulatory potential. But this raises some doubt as to how much wage growth we can really expect to result from Trump's deregulation efforts.

Does It Matter?

If economic performance is what ultimately decides national elections, November should be a cakewalk for Trump. While the 2017 tax cuts didn't deliver the results promised by the president and his magical-thinking supporters, the administration has delivered some continued economic expansion, some job creation, and some investment growth, followed by some wage increases. Time will tell how durable those benefits are.

Does it matter, politically speaking? In fact, there is some reason to think that voters prioritize economics above other issues. According to a new survey from CNBC, when asked what ""matters the most to you right now,"" 24 percent of Americans cite jobs and the economy, first among all responses, ahead of health care, immigration, and the environment.

Historically, the state of the economy is one of the best predictors of presidential elections. And today, most people are feeling pretty good: Only 21 percent of Americans say they're worse off now than they were four years ago. Although the latest RealClearPolitics polling average shows that 56 percent of Americans think the country is going in the wrong direction, that result is better than the 62 percent Americans who were pessimistic in November 2016.

Yet according to the CNBC poll, only 34 percent of Americans say the next presidential election will be about the economy. The current levels of ideological division may seriously diminish the potency of ""the state of the economy"" as a predictive variable in 2020, since partisan voters are likely to interpret the economic information available to them in a way that suits their political beliefs. The truth is that no one knows what the economic performance of the last four years means for the president's re-election chances.

Trump's Legacy

Trump's legacy will probably not depend on how the economy fares during his presidency. I suspect he will be remembered more for his lack of ethics, his juvenile language, his online bullying, his callous immigration policy, his admiration for foreign despots, his personal insecurities, his payment of hush money to a porn star—and, of course, for being impeached.

But there is little question that the Trump economy is, at least as of the first days of 2020, doing well. While presidents tend to have less control over economic outcomes than they—or the public—like to believe, at least some of the current success is due to policies implemented by this administration. Then again, Trump inherited an economy that was already in reasonably good shape. He has mostly managed not to mess it up.

For all of Trump's many failures to grasp economic principles (especially when it comes to the trade war), he exhibits no desire to be a full-scale social engineer. His worst economic instincts reflect standard-issue 17th century mercantilist fallacies. Humankind has flirted with, and often fallen head-over-heels in love with, these fallacies for centuries. They are damaging. They are maddening. And they're inexcusable in the modern era. But they don't represent the sort of calamitous wholesale restructuring of the economy promoted by the likes of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

In short, the president is a protectionist spendthrift. But he is not a socialist or a grand economic designer of any kind. And these days, that goes a long way toward keeping entrepreneurs and investors happy to create and compete in U.S. markets.

This doesn't make Trump a free marketeer or even a decent president. But it does help to explain the continued support he receives from the business community, which in turn explains—at least in part—the stock market's current buoyancy.

We are lucky to have an incredibly rich, resilient, and robust economy. The American economic system is not a delicate flower rooted in shallow or nutrient-poor institutional soil. Instead, it is a hardy oak, deeply planted in ground that's fed and watered by well-maintained institutions under which property and contract rights are reasonably secure and risk taking and innovation are generally rewarded. As long as our economy continues to be open and free, it is likely to keep growing."
Jun 05 2023,North Dakota's Burgum showcases he's 'a new leader for a changing economy' as he teases expected 2024 launch,Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/politics/north-dakotas-burgum-showcases-hes-new-leader-changing-economy-teases-expected-2024-launch,"FARGO, N.D. - EXCLUSIVE - Former software company CEO turned two-term North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is described as a ""small town boy turned self-made, world-class business leader"" and ""a new leader for a changing economy"" in a video released ahead of his expected Republican presidential campaign launch this week.

""Anger, yelling, infighting, that's not going to cut it anymore,"" Burgum says as he points to the political dysfunction in the nation's capital.

""Let's get things done. In North Dakota, we listen with respect, and we talk things out. That's how we can get America back on track. It will work,"" the governor emphasizes in the video, which was shared first with Fox News on Monday.

Burgum is expected to declare his candidacy for the GOP presidential nomination with a major announcement in Fargo, North Dakota planned for Wednesday, sources familiar with his plans confirmed last week.

THIS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR IS GETTING READY TO MAKE SOME NEWS

And Fox News has learned that Burgum will visit Iowa on Thursday and Friday (June 8-9), with stops in New Hampshire Saturday and Sunday (June 10-11). The two states for half a century have led off the GOP presidential nominating calendar.

""We need new leadership for our changing economy, innovation over regulation, instead of shutting down American oil and gas, we should unleash energy production and start selling energy to our allies instead of buying it from our enemies,"" Burgum proposes in his video.

And he touts that ""as governor we cut red tape and took North Dakota from billions in the hole to a surplus. We balanced the budget ever year and we did it all while passing the largest tax cuts in North Dakota history.""

Burgum points out that the ""states created the federal government, not the other way around. Let's shrink the federal government and return power to the states.""

The video, full of pictures of North Dakota's stunning landscape, spotlights Burgum's small town upbringing.

""My dad died when I was 14. Freshman year of high school. They pulled me off our basketball team bus and told me the news, ""he recalls. ""I grew up in a tiny town in North Dakota. Woke was what you did at 5am to start the day. A place where neighbors rally around you. My mom was our rock. Our hero.""

And he highlights that ""I started a shoe-shine business, worked at the grain elevator, and as a chimney sweep, paid my way through college and then earned an MBA at Stanford.""

WHO'S IN AND WHO'S ON THE SIDELINES — YOUR GUIDE TO THE 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACE

Burgum steered his one-time small business, Great Plains Software, into a $1 billion software company. His business — and its North Dakota-based workers — were eventually acquired by Microsoft, and Burgum stayed on board as a senior vice president.

""I ignored those who said North Dakota was too small, too cold, and too remote to build a world-class software company, so I literally bet the farm to help build a tiny start-up into a billionaire dollar company with customers in 132 countries,"" he says in his video.

In 2016, the then first-time candidate and long shot convincingly topped a favored GOP establishment contender to secure the Republican nomination in North Dakota before going on to a landslide victory in the gubernatorial general election in the solidly red state. Burgum was overwhelmingly re-elected in 2020 to a second term as governor.

The governor, who is not known well outside of North Dakota, would be considered a dark-horse contender in a field of actual and expected 2024 GOP presidential candidates with much higher name identification, including the current clear front-runner former President Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, former ambassador and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott.

But Burgum would enter the 2024 presidential race as one of the wealthiest members of the Republican field along with multi-millionaire entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and former President Donald Trump.

Burgum's campaign style video suggests that he'll focus his expected presidential campaign on two issues — the economy and energy. However, Burgum, who served as chair of the Western Governors Association, could also point to his recent moves as governor to sign into law a strict measure that bans abortions six weeks after gestation with limited exceptions, as well as legislation to restrict transgender rights and a bill making gender-affirming care for minors in the state a criminal offense."
Jul 28 2022,"US economy shrinks in second quarter, signaling unofficial start of recession",The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/28/us-economy-gdp-second-quarter,"The US economy shrank again in the last three months, unofficially signaling the start of a recession.

The commerce department announced Thursday that gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of the price of goods and services – decreased at an annualized rate of 0.9% in the second quarter after falling at an annualized rate of 1.6% in the first three months.

The bad news will be a major blow for the Biden administration as it prepares for a tough midterm election season. White House officials have tried to tamp down talk of a recession, arguing that many parts of the economy remain strong.

The growth rate stands in marked contrast to the robust 6.9% annual increase in GDP recorded in the final quarter of 2021 when the economy roared back from Covid shutdowns.

The fast pace of growth contributed to soaring inflation – now running at 40-year highs – and the Federal Reserve’s decision to sharply increase interest rates in order to bring down prices.

The changing economic environment was reflected in the GDP report. Consumer spending – the largest driver of the economy – slowed over the quarter but remained positive, rising 1% on an annual basis. Residential fixed investment, or home construction, dropped 14% on an annual basis and slowing business inventories, goods produced but not yet sold by businesses, dragged down the GDP number.

Two quarters of negative GDP growth are widely regarded as a signal that the economy has gone into recession. But the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. While the GDP figures will play into the NBER’s final verdict, it also looks at a wider range of economic factors, including the jobs market, and is unlikely to give its decision soon.

“The 0.9% annualized fall in GDP in the second quarter is disappointing but doesn’t mean the economy is in recession,” said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. “That said, the details show that higher rates and surging inflation are weighing on underlying demand, and we expect only a muted rebound in economic growth over the second half of the year.”

In the meantime, pressure remains on the Biden administration. Surveys of consumer confidence are falling as recession fears grow and Joe Biden’s overall and economic approval poll numbers are at the lowest levels of his presidency.

In a statement, Biden said it was “no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Reserve acts to bring down inflation. But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.”

Republicans countered that the report shows “Democrats’ reckless economic policies are destroying our economy”.

The latest GDP figures came a day after the Fed announced another three-quarter of a percentage point increase in its benchmark interest rates as it fights to tame inflation.

Prices rose at an annual rate of 9.1% in the year to June, driven up by soaring costs for fuel, food and shelter.

While parts of the US economy remain strong – most notably the jobs market – the Covid pandemic continues to play havoc with global supplies and the war in Ukraine has pushed up energy prices.

The confusing economic outlook has triggered sell-offs in stock markets around the world and led some economists to predict a recession is coming. Nearly 70% of leading academic economists polled by the Financial Times last month predicted the US economy will tip into a recession next year.

Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that he did not believe the US was now in a recession. But he said the Fed was prepared to keep raising rates in order to bring prices back down and that it was inevitable that such a move would slow the economy and affect the job market. “Price stability is what makes the whole economy work,” said Powell."
Dec 10 2015,"Breaking the ISIS economy, bit by bit",Christian Science Monitor,center,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Foreign-Policy/2015/1209/Breaking-the-ISIS-economy-bit-by-bit,"The finance ministers set to meet at the United Nations can’t put the Islamic State in a financial vise. But they can deliver some critical blows to an organization already showing signs of financial strain.

And for a UN Security Council often at odds, the meeting of its finance ministers next week comes at an opportune moment, when terrorists attacks worldwide have created a sense of shared purpose – even, it seems, between the United States and Russia.

The core of the Islamic State’s wealth is, in many respects, beyond the reach of next week’s meetings, hosted by the US. Only Turkey can shut its borders to the smugglers who carry Islamic State oil and other contraband, and only military force can deprive the group of the territory it uses for extortion and taxation.

But a more coordinated effort at targeting the Islamic State’s finances can pay dividends. The US and others, for example, have used bank reports of suspicious financial transactions to more effectively target locations where the Islamic State is producing and loading oil products.

Ramping up this coordination is akin to “squeezing the balloon” of Islamic State finances – though “not yet hard enough to pop it,” says Matthew Levitt, director of the counterterrorism and intelligence program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

And it is vital to defeating the Islamic State, he says. “Any opportunity to get this level of attention and cooperation on an issue that will be central to destroying ISIS should be seized and built upon.”

Terrorist attacks linked to the Islamic State in Beirut, Paris, and San Bernadino, Calif., appear to have galvanized the international community.

“What is reassuring is how much the nations of the world are taking this threat more and more seriously and working together with greater unity,” said Farhan Haq, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, to journalists earlier this week.

Particularly promising are indications the US and Russia “agree that the effort to dry up ISIS funding can and must be toughened up,” says Mr. Levitt, using another acronym for the Islamic State.

Both the US and Russia are pushing for a new council resolution on terror financing and could agree on one text by the Dec. 17 summit.

Already, there are indications that the Islamic State is feeling a financial pinch.

Reports out of Islamic State-controlled cities indicate the terror group is starting to cut back or is failing to make payroll to its employees and fighters.

The number and quality of Islamic State’s propaganda videos has declined in recent months as the group has been pushed out of territory in Syria and Iraq, according to a recent study by the website Jihadology, which is run by Aaron Zelin of the Washington Institute.

The progress Iraqi forces have made recently in taking back parts of the city of Ramadi is evidence not just of military weaknesses, but also of mounting financial woes, some experts say.

As for oil sales – the Islamic State’s second-most-important revenue source behind taxation – they, too, have taken a significant hit. Airstrikes by the US and other countries have shifted from targeting individual oil trucks to hitting refineries. Initially the US wanted to avoid destroying the infrastructure that Syria and Iraq developed.

Holding the finance ministers summit at the Security Council underscores the importance world leaders are placing on both terror financing and the coordination of financial, intelligence, and military efforts. The summit will mark the first time that a council session will be chaired by a financial official – US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.

The finance ministers can work to apply greater scrutiny across the board – from financial transactions that offer crucial clues about the Islamic State economy to money brought into the Islamic State by foreign fighters and donors around the region.

But the summit can only do so much.

Half or more of the Islamic State’s financial resources are generated from taxation or extortion within the territories the group controls in Syria and Iraq. That means that successfully cutting Islamic State funding is directly linked to the international military campaigns aimed at shrinking its territory.

“There are a number of actions that can be taken to reduce the financial streams, but one thing is clear: If you want to deprive ISIS of cash, you deprive it of territory,” says Jonathan Schanzer, vice president for research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Moreover, the Islamic State trafficks much of its oil and antiquities across Turkey’s border with Syria, experts say. The US has been pressing Turkey for months – mostly behind closed doors – to do more, while Russia has been much more public with its accusations.

Next week’s meetings are an opportunity for the international community to get on the same page to tackle some of these bigger funding streams.

“We’re not going to get anywhere on a critical issue like terror financing if it all sinks into a lot of finger-pointing and recriminations,” says Levitt. “If you can get beyond the bickering, then a lot more good can be done if you focus on helping Turkey shut down that border.”"
May 08 2023,Kevin McCarthy's scheme to blow up the economy smacks of John Galt. Biden can thwart both of them.,Daily Kos,left,https://dailykos.com/stories/2023/5/8/2168287/-Kevin-McCarthy-s-scheme-to-blow-up-the-economy-smacks-of-John-Galt-Biden-can-thwart-both-of-them,"The literary leitmotif in Ayn Rand’s 1959 novel, Atlas Shrugged, was a lengthy scheme by John Galt to extract all the “producers” from the American economy — and then to watch it (the economy) crumble under the weight of all the remaining “moochers” and “looters”. The book’s title alludes to just that outcome — Atlas (i.e. John Galt and his fellow producers) finally grows tired of carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, so he “shrugs” and the world (i.e. the economy) is thrown into chaos.

I have zero doubt that Rand’s novel lies at the heart of Kevin McCarthy’s 2023 scheme to destroy the American economy. McCarthy knows that his audience (voters who think like the members of the Freedom Caucus) worship Rand’s philosophy of “freedom from government”. He also knows that many of them think the time has finally arrived to unleash a Galt-like revolution in America. Where Trump failed, McCarthy (and his ilk) are hoping to to succeed.

Of course, these wingnuts fantasize that some 2023 versions of John Galt and Dagny Taggart will show up in the nick of time to rescue the “freedom lovers” from their self-induced chaos. In fact, Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert see no problem with disrupting the world’s economy — after all, it won’t be their fault. They are just mimicking John Galt’s actions, which (based on Rand’s self-affirmation) must be brilliant.

So where does Dark Brandon fit into this picture? Well, first off, he has the U.S. Constitution and nearly 250 years of American history on his side. He also has more than half of U.S. voters rooting for him to pull another miracle out of his hat, like he did in 2021/2022 with Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction.

DK had a couple of very interesting stories about the debt ceiling and the 14th Amendment on Friday and today. Of course, the upshot of both is that the 14th Amendment has already spoken on the constitutionality of the debt ceiling — and its answer is NO.

But we hear lots of weaseling from some economists, who think that anything other than a harmonious compromise between Biden and McCarthy will “rattle” international markets. Can Dark Brandon actually muster the political muscle to call McCarthy’s bluff by telling him (behind closed doors) exactly how he’s going to invoke the 14th Amendment to trivialize McCarthy’s Galt moment? And if McCarthy continues with his hostage taking, can Biden simply execute the plan that he threatened Kevin with in private?

The answer to both questions is YES!

Now, I’m sure there are a number of DK folks who may have specific reasons to doubt my optimism, but let’s play this out to see where it will go."
Jul 02 2021,"The US economy added 850,000 jobs in June",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/02/economy/june-jobs-report/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

The US economy added 850,000 jobs in June, when adjusted for seasonal changes. It was far more than economists had expected and a signal that American job growth is accelerating.

It was the biggest monthly jobs gain since August 2020, when the economy added 1.6 million jobs.

The hospitality and leisure sector grew the strongest, having the most ground to cover after the pandemic devastated the travel and service industries. That sector added 343,000 jobs. More than half of them were at restaurants and bars.

The number of education jobs also surged in June. Local government hiring jumped by 155,000 jobs, state governments jobs increased by 75,000, and private education positions were up by 39,000. The sector has seen a lot of fluctuation during the pandemic, distorting its seasonal patterns, making it harder to know what’s actually going on from month to month.

Nevertheless, June was a “bright” jobs report, even though there is still plenty to worry about, wrote Kate Bahn, interim chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, in a tweet. It “just means it’s good foundation to grow,” she added.

America’s once-strong labor market is still far from being back to normal, down 6.8 million jobs compared with February 2020. According to the report, 6.2 million people reported that they didn’t work at all or worked less because their employer had been affected by the pandemic.

A tale of two job markets

The unemployment rate stood at 5.9%, up from 5.8% in May, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

While the labor force participation rate was unchanged at 61.6%, the number of people quitting their jobs voluntarily to look for another position jumped by 164,000 to 942,000 in June – the highest level since November 2016.

It might seem counter-intuitive, but this actually could be a sign of worker empowerment: people who had few alternatives during the height of the pandemic, might be reconsidering their workplace now. And workers might take more time deciding on taking a job right now.

Normally, workers who quit their jobs aren’t eligible for benefits. But the pandemic has changed the rules slightly, making certain circumstances – such as child care issues or health conditions – reasons that some benefits can stay in place.

It’s a tale of a job market in imbalance: Employers are struggling to attract and retain staff as the reopening spurred a hiring surge, because some workers are still not ready to return to work. Many fear infection, or worry about adequate care for their children or elderly relatives.

All of this is creating an unprecedented mismatch between worker supply and demand.

It’s also what’s behind the recent increase in hourly earnings, as companies are upping pay to keep staff. Average hourly earnings rose by 10 cents to $30.40 in June, a slightly smaller increase than in the prior two months.

While many economists rejected claims that pandemic-era jobless benefits are keeping people comfortably at home and away from work, a number of states have cut the special programs ahead of the September deadline.

But that didn’t move the needle much in June yet. Early data from states that ended those programs shows that the move didn’t push workers to resume their job searches, said Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, in emailed comments.

Once all 50 states phase out the benefits in September, there could be a noticeable effect, she said. Benefits expire in 26 states by the end of July.

“More than this, however, we expect an additional few months of economic growth, more progress on Covid vaccinations and the resumption of in-person education in September to be the main factors driving a stronger increase in labor-force participation in the fall,” Birch added.

An uneven recovery

While workers across the board struggled during the pandemic, the economic hardship was mostly shouldered by lower income workers and non-White workers.

This is still reflected in the jobless rates for demographic groups.

The unemployment rate for Asian workers rose to 5.8% in June, from 5.5% in May, registering the biggest percentage point increase, even though it remained below the rate for the general population.

The jobless rates for Hispanic and Black workers each rose 0.1 percentage points, to 7.4% and 9.2%, respectively. This puts the rate for both populations far above that of the overall population.

The White unemployment increased to 5.2% from 5.1% in May.

Women were also disproportionately affected last year, but they made up nearly half the job gains in June.

But the rapidly rising cost of food, gas and other essentials is wiping out pay increases and eroding living standards.

Gross domestic product soared 5% on an annual basis in the third quarter, the government said on Tuesday.

To put that in perspective, it's the strongest quarter of growth since 2003.

""Other than the first quarter's weather-induced contraction, there's no doubt the economy has been great this year,"" said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG.

Investors cheered the news, sending the stock market to record highs with the Dow crossing 18,000 for the first time ever.

Growth came across the board with business investment, consumer spending, housing, exports and government spending all showing signs of strength.

Feeling more confident, consumers ramped up their spending to a healthy pace of 3.2%, compared with previous estimates for 2.2%. With gas prices remaining low, many expect that trend to continue through the holidays.

""Consumer spending north of 3% is pretty darn good these days,"" said Greenhaus.

Defense spending was also a huge driver in the third quarter, surging 16%.

U.S. economic strength: This is the third and final reading on GDP, and the 5% figure represents an upgrade from the Commerce Department's initial estimate of 3.9% growth.

The stellar third quarter also marks an acceleration from the very strong growth of 4.6% during the second quarter and the rough first quarter when GDP was -2.1% due to the harsh winter weather.

All of that helps explain why hiring has increased dramatically this year. Employers added 321,000 jobs in November, making 2014 the strongest year for job growth since 1999.

The solid growth could clear the path for the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in 2015. While there is some trepidation about the first interest rate hike in nearly a decade, it would signal that the U.S. economy in actually strong enough to take off the training wheels.

The American public appears to be taking notice of the flurry of positive economic headlines.

For the first time in seven years, more than half of Americans think the economy is in good shape, according to a new CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday. That marks a big improvement from October when just 38% of Americans said economic conditions were somewhat or very good.

But don't bet on another quarter of 5% growth to wrap up 2014. New data released on Tuesday showed that orders of big-ticket items unexpected declined in November, suggesting businesses are hitting the brakes on investment."

Oct 13 2014,OPINION: Why the world economy sputters,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-samuelson-the-three-reasons-the-world-economy-sputters/2014/10/12/aa7a74b4-50a8-11e4-8c24-487e92bc997b_story.html?hpid=z2,"It's become a dreary ritual: Every six months, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts the global economy — and cuts its previous forecast. Despite an army of economists, all of its forecasts since 2011 have been too optimistic. The latest, released last week, shaved 0.4 percentage points off the growth estimate made in April. The world economy is now expected to expand only 3.3 percent in 2014, down from a respectable 5.4 percent in 2010. The feeble growth raises the specter of a global recession.

IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde — her agency makes loans to financially troubled countries — calls the outlook ""the new mediocre."" Maybe worse. In August, manufacturing output fell in China, Japan, South Korea and much of Europe, report economists at JPMorgan Chase. A 4.3 percent month-to-month drop in Germany was especially ominous. Despite problems, the United States is ""the sole major economy still showing signs of strength,"" says Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad. But the U.S. recovery could founder on weakness abroad, via lower U.S. exports and foreign profits. About 30 percent of U.S. profits are earned overseas.

All of this has shaken global stock markets, which swung wildly last week. The turbulence poses two questions. Why does the IMF forecast so poorly? And more important: Why is the world economy so weak?

Part of the faulty forecasting, I suspect, reflects an (unavoidable) optimistic bias. You can't expect an international agency, responsible to its 188 member countries, to become a citadel of gloom. It can't ignore obvious facts, but it will give them the most plausible favorable twist.

The IMF’s own post-mortems of its forecasting corroborate this. After the financial crisis, it was widely believed that strong growth in “emerging market” countries — China, Brazil, India and others — would limit the economic damage. Their appetite for raw materials and sophisticated imports (aircraft, instruments) would support trade and investment. The IMF embraced this theory, which briefly seemed to work. Then many emerging markets suffered setbacks that the fund only belatedly recognized. Its overestimates of growth were concentrated in emerging markets, studies found.

But this isn’t the whole story, because it doesn’t explain why global growth is so weak. It just apportions the weakness among various countries. The deeper causes of sluggishness lie, I think, in the special circumstances of this recovery, which is unlike any other since World War II and involves three pervasive problems that foster pessimism and discourage spending.

One is the hangover from the 2008-2009 financial crisis. Sobered and scared, people and businesses delay consumption and investment. To prepare for the next crisis, they reduce debts (“deleverage”) and increase savings. Firms hoard profits. These may be prudent behaviors for individuals and companies, but when practiced by the multitudes, they subtract from economic activity.

Another problem is the legacy of global trade imbalances in the 1990s and early 2000s, when China and some other countries ran huge surpluses and the United States and some others ran huge deficits. This boosted growth for the exporters and their raw material and component suppliers — Australia, Brazil, South Korea and others. But this system depended on the voracious spending of Americans and Europeans. When the spending declined, the export bubble burst.

The third problem is the cost of maturing welfare states. The United States, Europe and Japan (about two-fifths of the global economy) face comparable problems. Their populations are aging. Their governments are committed to paying costly retiree benefits, and these same governments are already running sizable budget deficits. Curbing deficits — necessary for some countries to maintain financial confidence — means cutting spending or raising taxes.

All of these problems involve wrenching adjustments. Each affects countries differently. But all have a similar economic effect: They reduce demand. Any one of them would impose a formidable drag on national economies. The fact that all are operating simultaneously and reinforcing each other has forged them into a powerful international force that has, so far, offset many of the policies (low interest rates, budget deficits) intended to strengthen economic growth.

There are renewed calls for spending on infrastructure — roads, bridges, ports, airports — to overcome the world economy's lethargy. There are pros and cons to this. But a few numbers show that, even if embraced, infrastructure spending would be no panacea. Suppose a $1 trillion package of projects could be immediately identified, financed, started and finished in two years. In 2013, the IMF reckons the world economy's output was about $75 trillion. Over two years, the $1 trillion would add slightly more than one-half of 1 percent to global output annually.

We’re witnessing a historic break from the past. I think the IMF forecasters deserve some sympathy. They’re dealing with a global economy that strains our intellectual understanding and is outside their personal experience. We don’t know what we don’t know.

May 12 2021,"From lumber to labor, are we now in a ‘shortage economy’?",Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2021/0511/From-lumber-to-labor-are-we-now-in-a-shortage-economy,"Could inflation spin out of control? That would hinge on a policy mistake by the Federal Reserve. Frederic Mishkin, a former Fed governor now at Columbia University, says that “the level of mistakes made in the 1970s are extremely unlikely,” but the Fed needs to be extra vigilant.

On the labor front, for example, total U.S. employment is still about 10 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels. So some economists say the likely scenario is one in which both demand and supply rebound in tandem over time.

The economic trend of recent decades has been abundance for U.S. consumers, built on globalization and supply-chain automation. For now, the story is looking very different, as shortages emerge for key products.

Americans can expect more such shortages and price increases, economists say, as eager-to-spend consumers contemplate a post-pandemic economy and as record government stimulus boosts demand. The silver lining is that, while challenging for now, most of these shortages are expected to be temporary.

The U.S. economy may be reviving faster than many businesses can keep up with. Suddenly consumers are facing scarcities for everything from lumber to copper, computer chips to rental cars. Job applicants are scarce, too, in some rebounding sectors like restaurants.

Sitting in a chair in a lower-level conference room in Hyannis, Massachusetts, Hamilton “Tony” Shepley tries to describe the controlled chaos taking place upstairs in his building supply company, Shepley Wood Products.

“What comes after manic?” he asks. Business is booming, but lumber prices have tripled in a little over a year. Asphalt and wood shingles are in such short supply they’re being rationed. He worries that replacement window companies are about to jack up prices.

“In 43 years, we had shortages, sure,” Mr. Shepley says. “But never like this.”

Why We Wrote This The economic trend of recent decades has been abundance for U.S. consumers, built on globalization and supply-chain automation. For now, the story is looking very different, as shortages emerge for key products.

Welcome to the shortage economy. After four decades where optimized and increasingly global supply chains made goods available at rock-bottom prices – where even scarce energy suddenly became cheap and abundant because of new drilling technologies – America has suddenly run smack into scarcities for everything from lumber to copper, computer chips to rental cars, truckers to restaurant workers, ammunition for guns to chlorine tablets for swimming pools.

Americans can expect more such shortages and price increases, economists say, as eager-to-spend consumers contemplate a post-pandemic economy and as record government stimulus boosts demand. The silver lining in this is that most of these shortages are expected to be temporary.

“It’s going to seem a whole a lot worse than it might about a year from now,” says Gary Schlossberg, global strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “There’s a light at the end of the tunnel, if you have a pair of binoculars. I do think things will return to something approaching the kind of environment that we’ve seen over the last 10, 15 years.”

Looming over this burst of scarcity is the fear that the United States will return to the high inflation of the 1970s – a fear that many economists tend to discount.

“There is an issue that you have deja vu all over again, which could happen because of the policy mistakes of the type that were made in the 1970s,” says Frederic Mishkin, professor of banking at Columbia University and a former member of the Federal Reserve’s board of governors. But this time, he says, “the level of mistakes made in the 1970s are extremely unlikely.”

Consumer costs

The current shortages have hit homeowners. Paul Collins, of upscale Wellesley, Massachusetts, was shocked to find a garage door company include in its bid last month a 3:30 p.m. deadline. If he didn’t respond by that time, the price would be 7% higher.

The shortages have also hit consumers when they hit the road or go shopping. Rebounding demand has caused gasoline prices to nearly double since April 2020. Copper prices have hit all-time highs. Steel prices are up 75%, prompting appliance-makers and mattress manufacturers to hike prices. Procter & Gamble has announced price rises coming in September for baby care and feminine care products.

Pre-pandemic, it cost 33 cents to fire a round from an AR-15 rifle at the shooting range. “Now, it costs $1 every time I squeeze the trigger,” says Mark Oliva, spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation.

Most of the shortages are expected to be temporary because they’re pandemic-driven. Industry after industry, expecting the downturn of a year ago to last much longer, was surprised when consumers started spending again as early as last summer. Factories started having trouble keeping up with demand, especially when coronavirus cases on the factory floor caused temporary shutdowns of production lines. Now, with the average U.S. consumer flush with cash and eager to spend after pandemic lockdowns, supply is falling seriously short of booming demand in key areas.

Growth in U.S. manufacturing slowed slightly in April, reflecting in part supply-chain troubles, after hitting a 37-year high in March.

The supply of certain computer chips is so constrained right now that car companies have had to reduce their own production – or not install certain features, such as navigation systems, which used to come standard in models. These shortages ripple out to create new shortages.

Unable to buy new vehicles, rental car companies are now short of cars and charging sometimes double the price of a year ago. The chip shortage is now spreading to other industries, such as washing machines and smartphones. In March, a Samsung executive warned that the company might have to skip the rollout of a new Galaxy Note smartphone.

Even when the pandemic didn’t cause the shortage, high demand is creating bottlenecks. Ammunition-makers were cutting back after Hillary Clinton unexpectedly lost the 2016 presidential election. (The election of Democratic presidents typically boosts gun sales.) When many Americans bought a gun in 2020 – a surge that accompanied the pandemic and civil rights protests after the murder of George Floyd – ammunition manufacturers were caught flat-footed, says Mr. Oliva.

Ditto for the container ship industry, which was downsizing before the pandemic and now has a serious capacity shortage as exports boom.

Where’s the workforce?

Another bottleneck is a decades-old shortage of truck drivers. The problem is magnified when goods are in such big demand. But the problem isn’t really the supply of potential drivers, but the extremely poor pay for long-haul work, says Michael Belzer, a former truck driver and now professor of economics at Wayne State University. Adjusting for inflation, “we’re probably at about 50% on average today of the overall annual compensation of where we were back then [in the 1970s]. So it shouldn’t be a big shock that we have a hard time getting drivers.”

Typically, the market would force wages up. But deregulation in the 1970s and the decline of unions have meant that drivers who work as independent contractors haven’t had the market power to push for higher pay at the trucking companies that rely on them. Instead, the industry sees extremely high turnover.

A shortage of service workers is forcing some large retail and restaurant chains to raise wages to attract them back. Many workers are hesitant to go back, either because of fear of exposure to the coronavirus or continued school closures, which make it difficult for parents without childcare to reenter the workplace.

More controversially, many employers complain that supplemental federal benefits (currently an extra $300 per week) are encouraging would-be workers to stay home, because they can make more from unemployment than they would from a low-paying job. While that’s true for many of the unemployed, and job gains last month were shockingly small compared with expectations, economists disagree about how big a role unemployment benefits play.

In fact, some economists say that, with total U.S. employment still about 10 million jobs below pre-pandemic levels, the likely scenario is one in which both demand and supply revive in tandem over time.

Nevertheless, the Biden administration on Monday said the Labor Department would assist states to reimpose work-search requirements on the unemployed collecting benefits.

Would a continued labor shortage spark ’70s-style inflation? Deregulation and the decline of unions are two reasons many economists are skeptical. And big price hikes in certain categories don’t spark general inflation, anyway, says Professor Mishkin, the former Fed governor. Instead, high prices spur more production and bring supply and demand back into equilibrium. The real problem is policy.

In the 1970s, high Vietnam-era federal spending and the failure of the Fed to react by hiking interest rates led to the stagflation of that era. Professor Mishkin worries that now, just at a time when consumer demand is picking up, the Biden administration has pushed through more federal stimulus, which will create even more demand. That means the Fed will have to remain extra vigilant. If consumer prices start rising at an annual rate above 4%, it will have to raise interest rates.

If inflation doesn’t exceed that level, it won’t be a return to the 1970s, he adds, but it could mark a “mini deja vu.”"

Nearly half of voters say they’re likely to vote for Republicans to represent them in Congress, giving the party a slight but firm advantage as the party seeks to gain control of both the Senate and the House in November.

About 49% of likely voters say they plan to vote for a Republican compared to just 45% who said the same about Democrats, according to a new New York Times-Siena College poll. The latest numbers show a significant improvement for the GOP, who trailed Democrats by 1 percentage point in a similar poll conducted in September.

GOP NARROWS DEMOCRATS’ LEAD AMONG LATINO VOTERS: POLL

The increase in Republican support is partly due to economic concerns and rising inflation topping voter concerns, with 44% of voters saying those were the most important issues facing the country, according to the poll. Of those who are most concerned with the economy, a majority of voters favor Republicans (64%) over Democrats (30%) to handle the issue.

Democrats hold a 20-point advantage among voters who rate any other issue as their top concern.

The biggest swing came from female independent voters who favored Republicans by 18 points — a massive increase from September when the demographic group backed Democrats by 14 points, according to the poll. Democrats have especially sought to motivate women to turn out to the polls by heavily focusing on abortion, but the latest polls show the economy has trumped abortion as a top voter concern.

The New York Times-Siena College poll surveyed 792 likely voters nationwide from Oct. 9-12 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points."
Jul 01 2022,Atlanta Fed GDP tracker shows the U.S. economy is likely in a recession,CNBC,center,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/atlanta-fed-gdp-tracker-shows-the-us-economy-is-likely-in-a-recession.html,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reacts as he testifies before a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing on the ""Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress"", on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 22, 2022.

A Federal Reserve tracker of economic growth is pointing to an increased chance that the U.S. economy has entered a recession.

Most Wall Street economists have been pointing to an increased chance of negative growth ahead, but figure it won't come until at least 2023.

However, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow measure, which tracks economic data in real time and adjusts continuously, sees second-quarter output contracting by 2.1%. Coupled with the first-quarter's decline of 1.6%, that would fit the technical definition of recession.

""GDPNow has a strong track record, and the closer we get to July 28th's release [of the initial Q2 GDP estimate] the more accurate it becomes,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.

The tracker took a fairly precipitous fall from its last estimate of 0.3% growth on June 27. Data this week showing further weakness in consumer spending and inflation-adjusted domestic investment prompted the cut that put the April-through-June period into negative territory.

One big change in the quarter has been rising interest rates. In an effort to curb surging inflation, the Fed has jacked up its benchmark borrowing rate by 1.5 percentage points since March, with more increases likely to come through the remainder of the year and perhaps into 2023.

Fed officials have expressed optimism that they'll be able to tame inflation without sending the economy into recession. However, Chair Jerome Powell earlier this week said getting inflation down is the paramount job now."
Oct 11 2022,"Abortion, economy, Trump: Here's where Democrats and GOP are focusing midterm messaging",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/heres-where-democrats-gop-focusing-midterm-messaging,"

In the final stretch of the midterm election cycle, Democrats and Republicans have poured thousands of dollars into Facebook advertising campaigns to reach voters as both parties seek to gain control of Congress in November.

Democrats have spent millions of dollars on Facebook ads focusing on abortion access and reproductive rights in the months leading up to Election Day, beginning an ad blitz in June and gradually increasing their spending through November, according to data analyzed by Axios. Meanwhile, Republicans have focused their messaging on the economy and former President Donald Trump, as well as crime and public safety.

MIDTERMS 2022 LIVE: UPDATES FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AHEAD OF CRUCIAL ELECTION

Democrats began spending heavily on abortion messaging after the Supreme Court announced its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June, ending nationwide access to the procedure and returning its legality back to the states. Since then, the party has relied heavily on abortion messaging as a way to motivate voter turnout.

Neither party has spent much time focusing its messaging on President Joe Biden, with data from Bully Pulpit Interactive showing Republicans largely stopped buying Facebook ads criticizing the Biden administration in the early summer. Democrats have also distanced themselves from Biden in their midterm messaging, according to the data.

The data analyzed were taken from Facebook ad spending reports by the three major Democratic committees, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, as well as the three major Republican committees, the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and the National Republican Congressional Committee. The data were recorded from Jan. 1 to Oct. 8."
Jun 29 2022,"The US economy shrank 1.6% in the first quarter, adding to recession fears",CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/29/economy/gdp-first-quarter-final/index.html,"Minneapolis CNN Business —

The US economy shrank at a slightly faster rate than previously estimated during the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Wednesday.

With one quarter of negative economic growth in the books, the data adds to fears that a recession may be looming.

Real gross domestic product declined at an annualized rate of 1.6% from January to March, according to the BEA’s third and final revisions for the quarter.

Previously, the advance estimate released in April showed a contraction of 1.4%. Last month, that was revised to a decrease of 1.5%.

The first quarter GDP performance, which the BEA noted includes some unquantified effects from the pandemic and the Omicron variant surge, stood in contrast to the fourth quarter of 2021, when the economy grew at a rate of 6.9% from the prior quarter.

The first quarter of 2022, however, marked the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which sent economic shockwaves throughout the global supply chain, as well as the food, finance and energy markets.

Domestically, US inflation has soared to levels not seen in decades amid ongoing supply chain challenges, rising costs for commodities and labor and spiking oil prices.

The BEA attributed the latest decline of 0.1 percentage point to slower-than-expected growth in consumer spending, although that was partially offset by gains in private inventory investment.

The shift in estimates on consumer spending puts additional emphasis on the latest Personal Consumption Expenditures price index data, one of the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauges of inflation, said Shannon Seery, a Wells Fargo economist. The latest report is set for release on Thursday.

Wells Fargo expects a mild recession to occur in the second quarter of 2023, though strong household finances and solid consumer and business balance sheets should keep such a downturn, if it occurs, fairly tame, Seery said.

While a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of GDP declines, that’s not a hard-and-fast rule, especially for the folks who make the official determination. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of US recessions, considers a range of indicators in addition to GDP performance and defines a recession as a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.”

The advance estimate for second-quarter GDP performance is scheduled for release on July 28."

Jun 20 2022,The Fed will put the economy in a coma if that’s what’s needed to whip inflation,The Boston Globe,left,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/06/19/business/fed-will-put-economy-coma-if-thats-whats-needed-whip-inflation/,"And here’s the kicker: Times will most likely get tougher before they get better.

Consumer prices are accelerating faster than at any time since the early 1980s. The average 30-year mortgage rate is approaching 6 percent, the highest in 14 years. The stock market is melting down.

As the Federal Reserve drives up interest rates in a high-stakes bid to bring down inflation, more people will be out of a job. Real wages (adjusted for inflation) will stagnate or fall. Businesses will fail. People who can least afford it will take the biggest hit.

Still, if we’re lucky and all the breaks go our way — most helpful would be an end to the war in Ukraine, which has led to spikes in food and energy prices — we may dodge a full-blown recession.

Instead, inflation might gradually recede, as the higher borrowing costs engineered by the Fed restrain but don’t crush consumer spending and business investment. In this “soft landing” scenario, a version of which was laid out by the central bank last week in its most recent projections, the economy would continue to expand, though at a far slower pace than last year. Unemployment would climb but not dramatically.

But make no mistake: The Fed intends to break the back of inflation by any means necessary — even if that means a “hard landing,” with borrowing costs jammed so high the economy nose-dives into a job-killing recession.

“There’s always a risk of going too far or going not far enough,” Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, said during a news conference last week after the central bank approved a three-quarters of a percentage point increase in the benchmark federal funds rate, the third of the year and the largest since 1994.

“But I will say the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which it’s not an option,” he said. “We have to restore price stability, we really do, because. . . it’s the bedrock of the economy.”

In other words, Powell, once slammed for not acting more aggressively when inflation reared its head last year, is now willing to put the economy in a coma if that’s what’s needed to save it.

Nearly two years ago, Powell’s Fed adopted a new framework for approaching its mandate from Congress to support full employment while maintaining stable prices. A key change: Policy makers would err on the side of letting the jobless rate fall, and not tighten credit until inflation became a true scourge. At the time, inflation had been benign for almost a decade, and Fed officials believed a less hawkish stance would provide time for more people to get into the job market.

Now inflation is Public Enemy No. 1 for reasons you’re tired of hearing about: pandemic disruptions to the workforce and global supply chains, overgenerous government stimulus aid, and the surge in energy prices caused by sanctions against Russia for its attack on Ukraine. And inflation is a global problem, with consumer prices surging in Canada and Mexico, Britain, and parts of Europe and Asia.

Powell insisted last week that the Fed isn’t “trying to induce a recession now.” But the central bank has never brought unruly inflation to heel without causing a downturn.

The federal funds rate influences a broad range of borrowing costs. As the rate rises, so does the expense of carrying credit card balances. New mortgages will have higher monthly payments, as will car loans. It also becomes more costly for many businesses to borrow.

The Fed’s goal is to reduce the superheated demand for goods and services that has caused prices to mount. As consumer spending slows, hiring typically tails off, layoffs increase, and businesses invest less in plants and equipment.

“They get inflation down by making people poorer,” said Claudia Sahm, a consultant and former White House and central bank economist.

All recessions — defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research “as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months” — are bad. But some are worse than others.

The 2001 “dot-com” recession was considered short and mild. Unemployment went from 3.9 percent to 5.9 percent in the immediate aftermath of the 8-month downturn, a smaller runup than seen in some earlier recessions. The total loss of output was a blip on the long-term chart of economic growth.

During the Great Recession, by contrast, the jobless rate soared from below 5 percent at the end of 2007 to 10 percent in the months after growth resumed. That was a level that hadn’t been seen since the 1981-82 recession. Output shrank in five of the six quarters covered by the recession, including a devastating 8.5 percent annualized drop in the fourth quarter of 2008, which was the largest quarterly contraction in 50 years.

The general view of economists is that if there is a recession, it could feel more like 2001 than 2007-2009. The economy is growing, the financial system is solid, and unemployment, at 3.6 percent, is near a five-decade low.

“Consumers’ credit quality is up, savings are high, and they’ve paid down a lot of their debt,” said Stephen Cecchetti, an economist at the Brandeis International Business School and a former head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements.

There is an important caveat: In the year leading up to the 2001 recession, inflation was running at less than half the rate than it is today.

The severity of any downturn will depend on just how quickly inflation comes down to the Fed’s 2 percent target.

Using the central’s bank’s preferred measure, inflation is expected to run at 5.2 percent this year, and its projection is for that rate to fall to 2.2 percent in 2024.

A rough rule of thumb, according to Cecchetti, is that the jobless rate rises 1 percentage point for each 1 percentage-point drop in inflation. If so, unemployment could climb above 6 percent as the Fed lifts interest rates. That’s about 2 percentage points higher than the central bank’s unemployment estimate, and a warning that the Fed’s hoped-for soft landing might be much more of a white-knuckle flight.

Meanwhile, consumers are in a bad mood even with a strong job market. That’s what a pandemic followed by soaring food and gas prices will do.

Most at risk as the Fed wages its inflation battle are the housing sector and industries closely tied to it, such as furniture and appliance makers. Also vulnerable are industries that do best when consumers are spending freely, including hotels, restaurants, airlines, and discretionary goods and services.

Just how likely is a recession?

Economists put the odds of a downturn over the next 12 months at 1 in 3, according to the consensus of forecasts tracked by Bloomberg. That’s about the same as they were in the months before COVID arrived, when the economy was humming and inflation seemed like a thing of the past.

The consensus among chief executive officers is gloomier. More than 60 percent of CEOs globally see a recession in their regions by the end of 2023, according to the latest survey by The Conference Board, a corporate think tank. Fifteen percent believe a recession is already underway.

Bond investors, who are extremely attuned to inflation trends, have sent short-term yields to levels not seen since 2007. Current bond yields indicate that while investors have deep concerns, they don’t see a contraction as inevitable — yet.

“Investors believe the economy will slow sharply in coming months but will not suffer a recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “Of course, there is a lot of economic script to be written.”

The economy is at a crossroads. Powell said he sees a path to 2 percent inflation that doesn’t involve a recession.

“We don’t seek to put people out of work, of course,” Powell said. “But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability.”

What remains to be seen is just how painful the cost of price stability is.

Story highlights Vote on the stories you find most important and John Sutter will cover them The vote is taking place as part of Sutter's new Change the List project Sutter: Income inequality currently is leading the list of 20 topics That could change, however; voting continues until Monday

CNN —

When I asked CNN’s readers and viewers to pick the five social-justice topics I’ll cover for the rest of the year, I never expected so many of you to select the one with the Econ 101 title: “Widest rich-poor gap.” I figured most of the country, or the world, would be sick of reading about the recession and bankers and bailouts. As a person with a job, it would be easy for me to say that’s a 2008 story. Time to move on.

But that’s why I trust the wisdom of the crowd: You tell me when I’m wrong. America’s widening gap between the rich and poor – and this country’s fast-disappearing sense of security and progress and economic stability – is so far the top pick among the 20 subjects I presented as part of a new project called Change the List.

That tells me that for many of you, it is the most pressing justice issue of our time. I wouldn’t have seen that on my own, and I’m glad you did. You encouraged me to look deeper into the issue, and I’m excited that we might be delving into this story together.

John D. Sutter Edythe McNamee/CNN

The vote is part of a new CNN Opinion project that focuses on bringing attention to overlooked places and issues. I’m asking you to pick stories you find most compelling or important from a list of 20 – and I’ll report on the five winners. Voting closes at 2:00 p.m. ET on Monday, so there is still plenty of time for you to influence the outcome.

Here are the top five issues as of noon on Wednesday:

1. Rich-poor gap

2. Where rape is common

3. Poorest kids

4. Conflict is never-ending

5. America’s most endangered river

About 23,000 ballots have been submitted so far, and only 916 votes separate the topics in fourth and seventh places, as of this writing. That’s close. (While this story was being completed, “illegal animal trade” jumped into fifth place, for instance).

When I noticed rich-poor gap was such a crowd favorite, I was a little disappointed, to be honest. How could I stop an economy story from being dull and gray? But last night I started doing some research and started to see what many of you had already noticed: that this is a broadly important and interesting topic – an underreported story, despite the never-ending flood of financial news headlines. (Friends at sites like CNNMoney and NPR’s Planet Money have been doing a stellar job of covering the crisis; but does anyone want to read another jobs-report story? And just forget about the Dow.)

Beneath all the spreadsheets and wonkery, this seems to be a story about fairness and people. Is it one about rich folks who caused the recession and got off clean? About poor folks bearing the brunt of the recession? About a return to free market ideals? They’re fascinating issues, and I’m undecided on them at this point.

Last night, I watched the documentary “Park Avenue,” which focuses on the street in New York that’s home to a building it says has more billionaires than any other – and also a section of the Bronx with a high rate of infant mortality. The stats presented in the documentary are staggering: 1 in 7 Americans is on food stamps; a college degree is needed to compete, but the cost of college has soared since the 1980s; 400 of the richest people in the United States control as much wealth as the bottom 50% of Americans.

I’m glad it’s a topic you highlighted for me.

CNN should continue to cover the war in Syria, whether or not you would vote for that. Same goes for this NSA madness. But with Change the List, I’m trusting you to choose. You deserve to have a say in what I cover – and in what CNN covers. Not because this is a popularity contest, but because I firmly believe that stories are more meaningful for people when they’re part of them. No one wants be on the wrong end of a bullhorn.

I’m excited to explore these topics – any of these topics – together.

That’s journalism in the public interest.

So please vote. Think about which stories are most important, which could have the most impact and which you’re willing to be a part of. Encourage others to do the same. And if you’ve got a few extra Econ books sitting around, send ‘em my way.

Jun 17 2022,What gas prices do — and don’t — tell us about the economy,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/2022/6/17/23169695/record-high-gas-prices-economy-impact,"Gasoline is the only product in modern-day America whose price is listed on giant signs almost everywhere you go. Most people, even if they don’t drive, probably have a pretty good sense of what gas costs — currently averaging $5 a gallon nationwide.

The ubiquity and visibility of gas prices make them an easy shorthand for the rest of the economy, especially when they’re going up. And they often drive how people are generally feeling about the state of the economy and politics.

But gas prices aren’t really the best metric for understanding the broader economy. They’re very good for understanding the state of oil and refining but reveal less than you might think about the real-world impact on people’s lives.

There is a better, less alarmist measurement for understanding what’s happening to gas prices — one that shows that, even as gas prices near record highs, most households are still better off than they were in 2008.

What actually determines the price of gas

Gas prices, which have increased almost 50 percent over the past six months, are not yet at a record inflation-adjusted high, though they may still get there. JPMorgan analyst Natasha Kaneva said there’s a very real risk it might reach $6 by August. To beat the actual 2008 record, adjusted in 2022 dollars, gas prices would have to rise past $5.33.

The biggest driver of the cost of gas is the price of crude oil, which has been going up since October and is hovering around $120 a barrel, up from $70 a year ago. Russia’s war in Ukraine led the US and Europe to sanction Moscow, including its crude oil, which made up about 12 percent of the global market. (Before the war, the US got less than 4 percent of its oil from Russia, but those sanctions have affected oil markets globally by making it more expensive for others to access that oil.)

Demand for oil has also bounced back from the depths of the pandemic faster than oil production.

A second major driver of rising prices is the costs of refining crude oil. These costs are also going up: Refineries have shut down in the past few years, outpacing the new refineries being built. And while capacity has increased per refinery, most US refineries are already working at nearly full capacity. In short, demand for more refined oil has approached pre-pandemic levels, but refinery capacity hasn’t kept up.

The final two factors are how much it costs to get gas to your corner retail station and taxes. These are pretty marginal: Although some states have suspended their gas taxes, which pay for road improvement and highways, they make up a relatively small amount of the price.

The federal Energy Information Administration illustrated how those costs break down, current as of April:

One thing you’ll notice missing: the president. President Joe Biden’s drilling policies have nothing to do with gas prices.

This hasn’t stopped Republican politicians and conservative commentators from pointing to canceled leases in the Gulf of Mexico and Biden’s climate policies as a primary culprit for rising prices. But energy analysts are quick to point out this is not how oil markets work. The White House “can do symbolic things that don’t really lower prices, and they can do really dumb things that are counterproductive,” Bob McNally, an energy analyst at Rapidan Energy Group who served in the George W. Bush administration, told the Washington Post.

Oil supply doesn’t work as simply as turning on a faucet, and the president doesn’t even control the tap. “In the US right now, the constraints are within the industry itself, and have very little to do with any policies from the federal government,” said Sam Ori, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

Instead, oil companies have been “very reluctant to plow any of that revenue into capital investment for new wells,” Ori added.

Oil companies are having other issues, too, such as accessing the labor and materials like steel needed for putting pipes in the ground. The industry does plan to increase production in the US by about 1.8 million barrels a day this year, but these were planned changes, and already accounted for in the current price.

All this paints a grim picture looking forward for filling up your tank, since there are no easy fixes. Prices may continue to go up.

But it’s still not quite as dire as all this sounds.

The oil industry isn’t the economy

If there is one clear economic outcome from high oil prices, it’s oil company profits. The big five oil companies posted their best profits in over a decade at $35 billion in the first quarter of 2022, margins that will continue to climb as long as prices remain high.

Otherwise, there’s certainly a correlation between gas prices and the health of the US economy, but the exact relationship is murky. “When prices rise, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the economy is falling apart; when prices fall, it doesn’t necessarily mean the economy speeds ahead,” said Clark Williams-Derry, a researcher at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

The pandemic is an extreme example: Oil prices crashed along with demand. The price of crude oil went briefly negative because producers had to pay to haul it away, since there was such a major surplus and such little capacity for storage. Low prices don’t ensure a booming economy, and they can also make renewable adoption even harder. In September 2020, when gas prices were under $2.20, millions of Americans were out of work, with hundreds of thousands of workers losing their jobs every week.

If political rhetoric still links oil prices to the broader economy, it’s due to lessons learned from the oil shocks of the 1970s that are now dated. “In the 1970s, the reason that the oil crisis was so deadly was the US economy was far more oil-intensive,” Ori said.

Today, we can get more with less. US petroleum consumption has actually been roughly flat the past two decades even as the population and economy have grown. And improved fuel economy standards have helped ensure oil plays a shrinking role in the economy. Looking forward, that trend will continue. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for the auto industry require fleets to reach an average 49 miles per gallon by model year 2026 (up from 28 mpg).

One of the major problems with our collective oil price obsession is that it ignores that demand also responds to high prices. More people switch to other options like electric and public transit, and might be more likely to go electric or buy a more fuel-efficient car in the future. When gas spiked in 2008, driving behaviors and buying patterns also changed, as hybrid vehicle sales rose and SUV sales declined.

All this means that the interaction between gas prices and the economy as a whole, and even between gas prices and household budgets, isn’t as straightforward as it first seems.

A better way of understanding gas prices

That doesn’t mean people aren’t hurting because of rising prices. For households that run on oil, electricity and cooling is especially expensive in the summer months because of these rising prices. The price of natural gas, a fossil fuel that supplies about 40 percent of power to the grid, has also risen. And the EIA says it expects the average US household will spend about $450 more this year than last year, on an inflation-adjusted basis, for gasoline.

But there is a better metric for how much pain people are feeling from gas prices: how much disposable income people are spending on gas.

Right off the bat, this figure tells you that gas isn’t the primary expense for most households. “In reality, it’s an important but a relatively small share of the budget,” said Williams-Derry.

Gasoline spending plummeted to 1 percent of disposable personal income in 2020 as a result of shutdowns and low gas prices that year. It went back up to between 1.5 and 3.2 percent in 2021. And even though it’s rising in 2022, it’s still far below other times oil was over $100 a barrel.

Despite gas prices climbing to near-2008 territory (adjusted for inflation), this ratio is still far below 2008 levels. The EIA notes that as of early 2022, it is closer to the “average ratio of 2.5% from 2015 to 2019,” and forecasts it could rise to 3.2 percent this year before falling again late in 2022.

All this is more nuanced than gas price signs plastered everywhere. But the fact that the share of income most households are spending on gas is lower than 2008 is good news: It shows that, through more disposable income, less dependence on oil, or both, the rising price of gas doesn’t have to hurt people quite as much as it did in the past. It also shows the way to policies that would help offset the impact of rising prices even more, from energy efficiency and alternative modes of transit, or even policies that temporarily boost people’s incomes."
May 22 2013,Is the Economy Saving Obama's Approval Ratings?,New York Times (News),left,http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/is-the-economy-saving-obamas-approval-ratings/,"Political coverage over the last week has focused on a series of stories that reflect negatively on the executive branch — but President Obama’s approval ratings have held steady. As of Monday, Mr. Obama’s Gallup approval rating was 49 percent — the same as it was, on average, in April. Mr. Obama’s Rasmussen Reports approval rating was 48 percent, not much changed from an average of 50 percent in April. Mr. Obama’s approval rating in a CNN poll published on Sunday was 53 percent, little different from 51 percent in their April survey. And in a Washington Post-ABC News poll, Mr. Obama’s approval rating was 51 percent, essentially unchanged from 50 percent in April.

There are a lot of theories as to why Mr. Obama’s approval ratings have been unchanged in the wake of these controversies, which some news accounts and many of Mr. Obama’s opponents are describing as scandals. But these analyses may proceed from the wrong premise if they assume that the stories have had no impact. It could be that the controversies are, in fact, putting some downward pressure on Mr. Obama’s approval ratings — but that the losses are offset by improved voter attitudes about the economy.

I first put forth this hypothesis on Sunday, but Jon Cohen and Dan Balz of The Washington Post have advanced some tangible evidence on its behalf. In the latest Washington Post survey, Mr. Obama’s approval rating on the economy is 48 percent — up from 44 percent in April. This follows a series of surveys showing that consumer confidence is at or near its highest point since Mr. Obama took office. The economic mood may have been lifted by two highly visible indicators — record-breaking stock prices and rebounding housing prices — along with a series of improved jobs reports.

In the graphic below, I’ve compared Mr. Obama’s approval ratings on the economy to his overall approval rating in Washington Post surveys dating back to the beginning of his presidency. As you might expect, the two ratings are highly correlated. There is undoubtedly a strong causal relationship as well, although keep in mind that the causality can potentially go in both directions. (Voters who are satisfied with the economy will tend to view Mr. Obama more favorably over all, but those who are happy with his overall performance may also tend to take a more favorable view of his impact on the economy — the so-called halo effect.)

There is one significant outlier in the chart, which reflects an occasion on which Mr. Obama’s approval ratings were much higher than you might expect given views about his economic performance. That was in May 2011, just after the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, when a Washington Post poll put Mr. Obama’s overall approval rating at 56 percent despite just 40 percent approval on the economy.

The latest readings from the Washington Post poll aren’t nearly as dramatic as that instance — but there is a milder version of this same phenomenon working in the opposite direction. In other words, Mr. Obama’s approval rating in the new Washington Post poll is a now bit lower than you’d expect based on where voters rate him on the economy.

Based on the historical relationship between Mr. Obama’a overall and economic approval ratings in the poll, you’d predict that his overall approval rating would be 53 or 54 percent given an economic approval rating of 48 percent. Instead, it’s 51 percent. So it may be that the talk surrounding Benghazi, the I.R.S. and the Justice Department has negatively affected Mr. Obama’s approval rating by two or three percentage points, but that the economy has lifted his numbers by about the same amount."
Sep 19 2012,Poll: Romney losing edge on economy,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2012/sep/19/poll-romney-losing-his-edge-economy/,"Americans are growing increasingly optimistic about the economy and see President Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney as equally capable of overseeing its recovery, according to a poll released Wednesday.

An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 42 percent of voters expect the economy to improve over the next 12 months — the highest percentage since 2009 — and that 43 percent of voters think Mr. Obama would handle the economy better than Mr. Romney, compared with 43 percent who say the GOP candidate would do the better job.

SEE RELATED:

The results are a departure from polls throughout the race that consistently have shown that Americans think Mr. Romney is better equipped to handle the economy.

The poll, which surveyed 736 likely voters over the past week, also showed Mr. Obama with a 50-45 lead in the popular vote.

While the poll showed both candidates as even on the economy, Mr. Obama held significant edges in dealing with women’s issues and looking out for the middle class, and smaller edges in being a good commander-in-chief, dealing with Medicare and dealing with taxes.

The poll’s one bit of bad news for the president was that approval of his handling of foreign policy has slipped in the wake of ongoing unrest in the Middle East. Just 49 percent of voters said they approve of Mr. Obama’s foreign policy, down from 54 percent last month and his lowest figure since November 2010."

At the sold-out event held at the Ent Center for the Arts and hosted by Pike Peaks United Way’s Public Policy Council, the two candidates answered questions on issues including law enforcement, growth, economy and education.

With three weeks until Election Day, the debate offered voters a view into each candidate’s comprehensive vision for the city and differing approaches after both previously listed the same top three campaign priorities: infrastructure, public safety and economic vitality.

“My vision for this city is that we become an inclusive, culturally rich, economically prosperous, safe and vibrant city on a hill for the world to see,” Mobolade said. “This is a long-range vision that has actionable steps over the next four years and I’ve been taking a look at each one of these areas and we’ll be leaning into them, forming a community coalition around each of these areas.”

“This is the city that I fell in love with and my vision for the future is that this continues to be the place that everyone who comes here, whether you’re a visitor or for a job interview, falls in love with our community again,” Williams said. “It is absolutely critical that we address these needs that I have focused my campaign on.”

Williams touted his longtime political experience to show how he plans to approach issues including crime and public safety. He referenced his appointment to the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training board by Gov. Jared Polis and said this experience in public safety leadership would permit him to appropriately address the needs of law enforcement and firefighters in the city.

Mobolade said his efforts in public safety would focus on attrition issues and bolstering retention, rather than recruitment, based on concerns that he said have been brought to his campaign by the Colorado Springs Police Protective Association. “The problem is to boost morale. This is a workforce issue,” Mobolade said.

Mobolade, a political newcomer, outlined a plan to address affordable housing in Colorado Springs, first appointing a chief housing officer to directly report to him. As mayor, Mobloade said he would initiate new development conversations to bring down housing costs and prioritize diversifying city transportation with continued city growth.

Mobolade has experience as an entrepreneur, business leader and nonprofit founder. He is Colorado Springs' former Small Business Development administrator and co-founded restaurants Good Neighbors Meeting House and The Wild Goose Meeting House, as well as business consultant company Niche Coaching and Consulting. Mobolade also served as a ministry leader at First Presbyterian Church of Colorado Springs, according to his website.

Williams shared that he moved to Colorado Springs after a job offer gave him the choice between Denver and Colorado Springs in 1992; he called the decision an easy one. Now, he says he does not want Denver to interfere with decisions on local land use, citing many areas that the city should focus on to handle growth under his mayorship.

Williams most recently served as a member of the Colorado Springs City Council, where he worked with county representatives to make sure a voter-approved tax, which was extended for another 10 years in November, will help pay for upgrades to Marksheffel Road and Powers Boulevard.

Williams is also a former El Paso County commissioner, clerk and recorder and Colorado secretary of state. When he was a county commissioner, he established the Pikes Peak Regional Transportation Authority that collects a 1-cent regional sales tax that funds transportation projects. As clerk and recorder, he said he created an office on Fort Carson for people to get things like licensing and election services taken care of.

""I've had the opportunity to actually deliver and create opportunities in this community,"" he said.

Both candidates also recognized city government's role in addressing homelessness.

Williams said there he would have a two-fold approach, the first by enforcing related ordinances like illegal camping, the second to work with and support nonprofits that provide resources to people who are unhoused.

Mobolade cited mental health as the root cause for a large percentage of people who are unhoused and expressed intentions to support mental health initiatives, in addition to wraparound care and increased outreach professionals.

A question from a student attending the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where the Ent Center is located, asked what these two candidates would do as mayor to entice local college graduates to either remain in the city or return for their careers. Both expressed an interest in connecting young professionals with job openings in the city.

Both candidates have children and shared plans to support public education as mayor. Mobolade pushed public safety in schools, sharing that this is an especially important topic for him because his oldest child at 9 years old is the same age as the three third graders killed in a mass shooting at a Nashville school last month.

Williams echoed public safety support with school resource officers. He also expressed a desire to support parents doing what is best for their child’s education, citing his own experience putting his four children through public school in Colorado Springs.

""Parents know best for their children and we should support that,” Williams said.

In the runoff, the candidate who earns a majority of votes, or more than 50% of votes cast, will be named mayor.

“A lot of people chose not to vote in that first election,” Williams said after around 35% of registered voters cast ballots in the municipal election on April 4.

“Please vote. Please recognize that whether or not you voted in the first election, you have that opportunity and responsibility to vote in this one.”

Jun 20 2012,Fed forecast: Weaker economy ahead,CNN (Online News),left,http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/20/news/economy/bernanke-press-conference/,"NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Could more stimulus be on the way?

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke certainly left the option on the table Wednesday, making perfectly clear that he stands ready to do more should the U.S. economy take a turn for the worse.









""In case things get worse, we are prepared to protect the U.S. economy and financial system,"" Bernanke told reporters at a press conference.

It was a point he reiterated several times and a sign that many outsiders took to mean the Fed has left the door open on a third round of asset purchases known as quantitative easing, or QE.

""Mr. Bernanke's press conference surely left few doubts that the Fed will take more aggressive action and renew QE if the economy fails to perform as they expect,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.

Meanwhile, University of Pennsylvania Economist Justin Wolfers tweeted: ""I read the Fed as saying: One more bad jobs report, and we'll do more.""

Indeed, the job market remains one of Bernanke's top concerns. The unemployment rate is still uncomfortably high at 8.2%, and the government's latest jobs report showed employers added only 69,000 jobs in May-- the weakest hiring in a year.

Bernanke also warned of Europe's financial crisis and uncertainty surrounding the ""fiscal cliff"" putting a dent in U.S. growth. (Read: Fiscal cliff: What you need to know)

Amid those concerns, the Fed extended its existing policy known as Operation Twist, and lowered its expectations for the job market and the broader U.S. economy this year.

The central bank predicts the unemployment rate will end the year between 8% and 8.2%. Just two months ago, it was more optimistic, predicting the jobless rate could fall as low as 7.8%.

""Growth in employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated,"" the Fed said in an official statement.

The Fed also sees broader weakness ahead, predicting the economy will grow between 1.9% and 2.4% this year. When the Fed met back in April, it had forecasted that the economy would grow as much as 2.9%.

That weaker outlook prompted the Fed to extend Operation Twist by $267 billion.

The program swaps short-term bonds for ones with longer durations, thereby pushing interest rates lower on mortgages and business loans. The hope is that cheaper credit will reach consumers and business, who will then boost the economy by spending more.

The effect on Main Street has been questionable though. Mortgage rates are at record lows, but even so, new home sales have been choppy and banks are still unwilling to lend to anyone with less-than-perfect credit. Small business owners are also struggling to get loans."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images

The Obama administration is searching for a ""sweet spot"" in economic policy: measures that could increase job growth right now without worsening the federal deficit. That task gained new urgency this month when the Labor Department reported a sharp slowdown in job growth in May.

The challenge could force the president to try to revive his ""grand bargain"" with Republicans.

For the first couple of months this year, the sun shone on the U.S. job market, which seemed to be recovering without much help from Washington. Storm clouds began to gather in the past three months, though. Former White House economic adviser Larry Summers says the outlook now is a lot less rosy.

""It was reasonable to hope several months ago that the economy was finally going to reach escape velocity,"" Summers says. ""I don't think one can continue to have those judgments today.""

The one silver lining, Summers says, is the remarkably low interest rates at which the U.S. government can still borrow money. That creates an opportunity for the government to give the economy a temporary lift — by spending money on public works projects and other investments that will only cost more down the road.

""You're going to have to restore Kennedy Airport sometime. Why not do it now when construction unemployment is so high and interest rates are so low?"" he says.

An End To 'Stimulus In Isolation'?

The jobs bill President Obama proposed to Congress last year did include modest investments in public works, as well as money to help local governments keep teachers on the payroll.

Alan Krueger, who chairs the president's Council of Economic Advisers, says that if Congress had approved those measures, the May jobs report might not have been so gloomy.

""We lost 28,000 construction jobs, 8,000 education jobs. Had the president's proposal passed, which he reiterated and included in his budget, we would be in a better situation for workers in those two sectors,"" Krueger says.

With unemployment climbing to 8.2 percent last month, some economists now see a need for more aggressive federal action. But the president is constrained by anti-spending Republicans in Congress and a ballooning federal deficit.

Fiscal watchdog Maya MacGuineas, who heads the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, sees no chance for a big new round of spending — one that would simply add to the government's red ink.

""I think the days of stimulus in isolation are over,"" she says. ""I don't think they could pass Congress and I don't think they would work.""

But MacGuineas says the story might be different if the short-term stimulus were part of a larger package that also included long-term deficit reduction.

From 'Inconceivable To Inevitable'?

There's already pressure in Washington to make such a deal to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of this year. That's when all of the Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire, and when automatic spending cuts are set to go into effect. The combination would be a major shock to the fragile economy.

""The only real option to avoid these bad scenarios is if we come together and compromise on replacing the fiscal cliff on some kind of comprehensive debt deal that's phased in more gradually and is more consistent with economic growth,"" MacGuineas says.

Republicans — and some Democrats — say they're determined to prevent the tax cuts from expiring in December, though the Congressional Budget Office warned this week that further extensions will mean even wider deficits.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, argues the threat of higher taxes is one reason employers aren't hiring.

""The American people have had it with big government and high taxes and a regulatory system that knows no bounds,"" he says. ""And they want elected officials to take control of the situation so that American job creators can go back to doing what they do best: creating jobs.""

Congressional Republicans and the president seem no closer to a ""grand bargain"" now than they were when talks fell apart last summer. But Summers hasn't given up hope for an economic shot in the arm.

""If you certainly look at the vexed climate, it's easy to be pessimistic,"" he says. ""On the other hand, I've observed over time that in the face of events, particularly in the face of difficult events, the transition from inconceivable to inevitable can sometimes be relatively rapid.""

The looming tax deadline will put pressure on Republicans, while another month of sluggish job growth would do the same for Obama."
Dec 21 2021,Omicron casts a new shadow over economy’s pandemic recovery,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-nhl-technology-entertainment-sports-4e3dde5757172cc9124774e13ea7c47a,"Just as Americans and Europeans were eagerly awaiting their most normal holiday season in a couple of years, the omicron variant has unleashed a fresh round of fear and uncertainty — for travelers, shoppers, party-goers and their economies as a whole.

The Rockettes have canceled their Christmas show in New York. Some London restaurants have emptied out as commuters avoid the downtown. Broadway shows are canceling some performances. The National Hockey League suspended its games until after Christmas. Boston plans to require diners, revelers and shoppers to show proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, bars and stores.

A heightened sense of anxiety has begun to erode the willingness of some people and some businesses to carry on as usual in the face of the extraordinarily contagious omicron variant, which has fast become the dominant version of the virus in the United States.

Other people are still traveling, spending and congregating as they normally do, though often with more caution. Holiday air travel remains robust. Many stores and restaurants are still enjoying solid sales. And omicron has yet to keep audiences away from movie theaters in significant numbers. This past weekend, record audiences across all demographics flocked to theaters for the new “Spider-Man” movie.

“The movie theater has not yet been hindered by omicron,” said Steve Buck, the chief strategy officer of EntTelligence.

At the same time, no one knows yet what omicron will ultimately mean for the health of the Western economies, which have endured a wild ride of downturns and recoveries since early 2020.

“These mutations keep coming,’’ said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. “What is the probability that sometime we get a really nasty one? No one has any idea. This thing is mutating, and it’s very, very hard to say.’’

Will omicron cause outbreaks at factories and ports, disrupt operations and worsen supply chain bottlenecks that have forced up prices and contributed to the hottest U.S. inflation in decades?

Will it mean people will hunker down at home again and spend less on services — restaurant meals, concerts, hotel stays — which could weaken the economy but potentially defuse inflationary pressures?

Will return-to-office plans for white collar workers be put on hold indefinitely, deepening the hit to many cities’ downtown businesses?

Or will omicron prove a blip that scarcely slows what has become a surprisingly strong recovery from the short but intense pandemic recession?

Spooked by uncertainty and fear of the worst-case scenarios, stock markets around the world sold off for three days before rebounding Tuesday.

“We don’t know whether this is good or bad for growth or inflation in the medium term,’’ said Megan Greene, global chief economist at the Kroll Institute. “We just don’t have enough data yet.’’

Unable to assess its longer-term consequences, businesses, consumers and policymakers have struggled to respond to the omicron threat.

Danielle Ballantyne, a Chicago dietitian, had planned to visit some stores and seek inspiration for holiday gifts. But as omicron spread, she scrapped that idea in favor of staying home and shopping online.

“From what I have been hearing in the news,” Ballantyne said, “omicron is more contagious. So I am trying to be more selective in where I go in terms of big public spaces.’’

At its stores in big cities like New York and Chicago, the clothier Untuckit is reporting a 15% drop in traffic, similar to what it experienced when the delta variant started spreading last summer.

“It impacts people’s perception of comfort and safety and their willingness to go out,’’ said Aaron Sanandres, CEO of the company.

As infections have spread, European countries have so far gone further than the United States, with restrictions ranging from a full lockdown in the Netherlands to indoor mask mandates in the United Kingdom.

A theater in western England refunded $240,000 in tickets. The Advantage Travel Group, which represents U.K. travel agents, said that business — flights, cruises and package holidays — plummeted fell 40% in mid-December from a month earlier. A diner in central Madrid absorbed cancellations for about half its booked space one week recently.

In London, downtown restaurants are suffering as office workers stay home.

“As soon as they said work from home, it’s completely emptied,’’ said Sally Abe, a chef at the Conrad Hotel in central London.

On Tuesday, Britain announced that it would provide 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in grants and other aid to help the hospitality industry survive omicron. The government bowed to pressure from pubs, restaurants and other businesses whose income has plunged in the aftermath of public health warnings.

Since the pandemic hit nearly two years ago, it has imposed one economic challenge after another. Economies all but shut down when the virus struck early last year. More than 22 million people in the United States alone lost jobs. Bars, restaurants and hotels were particularly devastated.

But record-high infusions of government spending and, eventually, the rollout of vaccines triggered an unexpectedly powerful recovery, giving many households the confidence and financial wherewithal to resume shopping. And it sparked optimism for the 2021 holiday season: In an updated forecast shortly before omicron emerged as a serious threat, the National Retail Federation said U.S. holiday sales were on track for a record-breaking year.

One fear now is that omicron infections will further disrupt manufacturing and shipping, worsen the supply chain backlogs and keep inflation simmering. It could also increase consumers’ already intensified demand for goods, which would magnify the supply shortages.

“If everybody is freaked out that going to a bar or restaurant is going to land them in a hospital, they may continue to buy goods,’’ said Greene, the Kroll Institute economist. “So that could exacerbate the short-term trend and make inflation worse.’’

On the other hand, she said, “if growth is really dampened (by omicron), that should take the heat off inflation.’’

There are other reasons to think the recovery could decelerate. In the United States, economic aid from federal spending and relief checks is fading. The Federal Reserve is reducing its economic support. China’s economy, the world’s second-biggest after the United States, is slowing.

For now, the U.S. bond market is signaling more concern about economic weakness than about runaway inflation: The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historically low levels, below 1.5%.

Citing omicron and other factors, Oxford Economics has downgraded its estimate of U.S. economic growth for the October-December quarter to a 7.3% annual pace, down from an earlier 7.8% estimate.

“Omicron has been so rampant,’’ said Kathy Bostjancic, Oxford’s chief U.S. financial economist. “And it is hitting in high-density areas of the Northeast. We think it is going to take a pretty big toll on economic activity.’’

That said, it’s also possible that the economy will prove resilient against the latest challenge COVID has thrown at it. One measure of retail traffic shows that the new variant has made little difference — at least so far. For the week that ended Dec. 18, store traffic was up nearly 20% from a year earlier, though down 23% from the same week in the pre-pandemic year of 2019, according to Sensormatic Solutions. For the Black Friday that ended Nov. 27, sales were up 30% from last year.

Peter McCall, Sensormatic’s senior manager of retail consulting, noted that shoppers are still going to retail stores but are now favoring open-air shopping centers and outlet malls more than enclosed shopping centers.

Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corp., the world’s leading cruise company, said this week that Carnival had experienced “a little spike’’ in cancellations but predicted that it would prove just a short term blip.

“The booking patterns are strong,’’ Donald said.

So is the traffic at some big retailers. Several hundred people lined up for the opening of the Toys R Us flagship store Sunday at the American Dream mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

“We were prepared for a big day, but it was even bigger than we thought,’’ said Yehuda Shmidman, co-founder of WHP Global, which owns Toys R Us.

Abt Electronics in Chicago says it’s enjoying a strong holiday season so far, with sales up 10% from a year ago. But Jon Abt, co-president and a grandson of the company’s founder, said he’s noticed that omicron is changing how some people shop. Though fewer customers are entering stores, there’s increasing demand for curbside pickup.

He’s also made changes for workers designed to prevent the spread of COVID: He’s requiring them to stay at the counters or warehouses where they work instead of jumping back and forth to different workplaces.

“I am an optimist,’’ Abt said. “I am not a worrier. This is life. And you have got to roll with the punches.’’

Mar 28 2019,"Trump Owns the Economy Now, for Better or Worse",New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/us/politics/us-economy-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage,"WASHINGTON — President Trump is getting exactly what he wants on the economy, but it may not last.

The Federal Reserve has abruptly stopped its march toward higher interest rates, as Mr. Trump demanded. The tax cuts he signed in late 2017 are in full swing. His attempt to rewrite the global rules of trade are underway, and he proclaims himself happy with the array of new tariffs he has imposed. His recent comments suggest he is unconcerned about slowdowns in China and Europe, which he considers economic rivals.

But while Mr. Trump points with pride to last year’s economic growth and promises even faster growth to come, there are signs that his most dependable talking point is eroding. On Thursday, the Commerce Department issued a downward revision of its estimates for economic growth in the fourth quarter, pushing one measure of the full year’s growth down as well.

Forecasters outside the White House, including officials at the Fed, expect growth to slow even more this year. Economic data suggests that slowdown is already underway in the first quarter. Manufacturing is losing some of its steam from last year’s rapid growth, and job creation is also moderating. Chief executives of some of the nation’s biggest companies see investment, hiring and sales growth all slowing this year. Three-quarters of business economists say they are more worried about growth undershooting their forecasts than overshooting it, and half have revised those forecasts downward for this year.

White House officials see growth staying above 3 percent for the next few years — and potentially for an entire decade, provided Mr. Trump can continue carrying out his economic agenda, including another round of tax cuts, a $1 trillion infrastructure plan and additional deregulation."
May 23 2022,Biden pitches Democrats as saviors for US economy ahead of midterm elections,The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/23/us-economy-joe-biden-republicans,"On a recent visit to a family farm in rural Illinois, thousands of miles away from the front lines of the grinding war in Ukraine, Joe Biden lashed out at his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, blaming him for destabalizing global food supplies and driving up the cost of groceries at home.

Russia’s assault on Ukraine, Biden explained after a tour of the farm’s fields and grain bins, has dramatically reduced food exports from the warring nations that together supply more than a quarter of the world’s wheat, causing food prices to spiral.

“Right now, America is fighting on two fronts,” the president said. “At home, it’s inflation and rising prices. Abroad, it’s helping Ukrainians defend their democracy and feeding those who are left hungry around the world because Russian atrocities exist.”

With less than six months before the midterm congressional elections, Biden is talking about the economy – a lot. It is the top issue on voters’ minds and, worryingly for Democrats, one of the biggest political liabilities for the president and his party.

Despite a streak of steady job growth and low unemployment, Americans are deeply pessimistic about the state of the economy. Inflation, running at nearly its fastest rate in four decades, has become inescapable. Gas prices have surged to record highs as many families struggle to afford the basic necessities like food and rent. Now economists are warning of possible recession.

Compounding matters, a shortage of baby formula has left parents in one of the world’s wealthiest countries scrounging to feed their infants.

Amid the national tumult over the economy, Biden’s approval ratings have fallen sharply, dipping to the lowest point of his presidency – 39% – this month, according to the latest AP-NORC poll.

The visit to the Illinois farm was part of a wider effort by the White House to reset the narrative around the economy after months of unyielding criticism from Republicans, who have used inflation as a political cudgel against Biden.

In recent days, Biden has sought to tell a textured story about the economy, one that concludes with the sharp warning that as bleak as it can seem now, the alternative – Republican control of Congress – would be much worse.

In his telling, the administration pulled the nation back from the brink of economic catastrophe with a massive stimulus bill and mass vaccination campaign that saved lives and livelihoods during the depths of the pandemic. Two years on, there is much more to do.

Naming inflation as his “top domestic priority”, Biden has touted the administration’s efforts to put the economy on a sturdier path by strengthening the nation’s supply chains, cracking down on price gouging and releasing oil from the strategic reserve.

Under mounting pressure in recent weeks, he invoked the Defense Production Act to ramp up baby formula production and launched “Operation Fly Formula” to rush shipments into the US from overseas.

Yet those actions, he charged, are being undermined by Putin’s aggression in Ukraine, which has sent fuel and food prices soaring; new Covid-19 lockdowns in China that are straining supply chains anew; alleged price-gouging by oil companies; and an “ultra-Maga” Republican party intent on obstructing the president at every turn.

Biden says he understands Americans’ frustration with rising costs and the slow pace of progress in Washington – so deeply, in fact, he could “taste” it. But electing Republicans, he argued, would not ease their troubles.

“Americans have a choice right now between two paths, reflecting two very different sets of values,” Biden said. He charged that the Republican party, still in the thrall of Donald Trump, had no serious plan to tackle inflation and was instead more focused on fighting issues such as banning textbooks from classrooms.

In a press release, the Republican National Committee accused Biden of being “desperate to blame anyone but himself for the worst inflation in 40 years”.

“But,” it added, “the American people know he is responsible.”

For Democrats who hold narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, asking voters for two more years of unified government in Washington is a risk that Biden himself acknowledged.

Voters historically punish the president’s party in the midterm elections. And this cycle, Democrats have struggled to energize their base, deflated over the party’s failure to pass Biden’s sweeping agenda, designed to remedy longstanding economic challenges. At the same time, Democrats are struggling to persuade independent and moderate Republicans voters who recoiled from Donald Trump in 2018 and 2020.

Whether Democrats can change voters’ attitudes on the economy weighs heavily on their prospects.

Public opinion surveys have consistently found that voters have more trust in Republicans to handle the economy and inflation than Democrats. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that only 28% of Americans approved of the job Biden was doing to tackle inflation, while 68% disapproved. The same poll showed that 50% of Americans believe Republicans were better able to handle the economy. Just 36% said the same about Democrats.

The political headwinds against them, Democrats believe they have found an opening that will undercut Republicans’ advantage.

A plan written by Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, would require all Americans to pay some income tax, including families that don’t earn enough to owe taxes now, and would require Congress to reauthorize all federal legislation every five years.

Biden recently used his bully pulpit to elevate Scott’s 11-Point Plan to Rescue America, which he attacked as an “extreme” vision for the country.

Many Republicans, including Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, have distanced themselves from the proposal. Downplaying the disagreement, the White House said it was the only comprehensive plan Republicans have put forward for the midterm elections. “This is not the last you’ve heard from us about chairman Scott’s tax plan that will raise taxes,” Jen Psaki, in her last week as White House press secretary, said.

In a withering response, Scott called Biden unfit for office and challenged him to a debate.

“Joe Biden can blame me all he wants,” the Florida senator said. “Here’s the truth: he’s the president of the United States, Democrats control the House of Representatives and the Senate. Democrats’ agenda is hurting American families and no amount of spin can change that.”

A polling memo by Navigator Research, a Democratic messaging group, underscores why the party is seizing on Scott’s plan. It found that the proposal, when described as a plan that would “raise taxes” on millions of working-class families and potentially threaten entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, was deeply unpopular, even among Republican voters. And when contrasted with the Democrats’ economic agenda, voters’ views of Biden and his party on the economy improved.

Isaiah Bailey, an advisor to Navigator Research, said it was incumbent on Democrats to make voters aware of these dueling visions for the country.

“Unpopular positions are only politically meaningful when they permeate public consciousness,” Bailey said. He added that Democrats must demonstrate that they are trying to deliver on their promises, even in the face of Republican opposition and procedural challenges like the filibuster.

“Democrats really need to look like fighters,” he said.

Maria Cardona, a veteran Democratic strategist who has urged her party’s leaders to talk more about the economy with more urgency and empathy, agreed.

“For way too long Republicans have gotten away with blaming Democrats, pointing the finger and talking about Biden’s policies,” she said.

With so much at stake this fall, including the push to ban abortion if the supreme court overturns Roe v Wade, as is expected, Cardona said it was imperative that Democrats draw a clear contrast with the opposition party.

“There’s no question in my mind that we are not taking advantage of the moment in time, when handing over control of Congress to the Republican party is more dangerous for the future of our democracy and for the well-being of our citizenship than it has been in at least a generation,” she said.

Surveys suggest that voters broadly understand – and support – the decision to impose sanctions on Russia, even if there are consequences for their pocketbooks. And many cite the ongoing pandemic as a leading cause of the nation’s economic woes. Yet there are signs dissatisfaction with the president’s economic leadership is hardening.

“It does not blunt their desire to have you produce a solution,” said Patrick Gaspard, president and chief executive of the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington. “They’re clear on what the causation is but also clear that they want this president, this Congress, to solve the problem.”

A president’s ability to tackle inflation is limited. That power rests largely with the Federal Reserve.

Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and a senior fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution, said there are indications that the president’s efforts to shore up the nation’s supply chains are taking root.

One of the best steps the White House can take, she said, is to “not create additional hurdles for monetary policymakers”.

“Let monetary policy run its course,” she said, adding that on that front she believes “they’re doing the right things there”.

Aiming to cool the economy, the central bank recently approved the sharpest rise in interest rates in more than 20 years. But Jerome Powell, fresh from being confirmed by the Senate for a second term as chair of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged the challenge of attempting to control inflation without tipping the US economy into a recession.

Ahead of Biden’s visit to Illinois, the White House received a dash of good news in an otherwise discouraging report: inflation slowed for the first time in months, though the annual rate remained high. But speaking at a fundraiser in Chicago later that day, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of the task ahead.

“It’s going to be hard because inflation is going to scare the living hell out of everybody,” he said. “We have a problem we have to deal with. In the meantime, we can’t take our eye off all that could happen if we do not prevail.”

Nov 29 2012,Make the Democrats Own the Obama Economy,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2012/11/28/make_the_democrats_own_the_obama_economy,"One bright spot of Barack Obama's re-election was knowing that unemployment rates were about to soar for the precise groups that voted for him -- young people, unskilled workers and single women with degrees in gender studies. But now the Democrats are sullying my silver lining by forcing Republicans to block an utterly pointless tax-raising scheme in order to blame the coming economic Armageddon on them.



Democrats are proposing to reinstate the Bush tax cuts for everyone ... except ""the rich."" (Why do only tax cuts come with an expiration date? Why not tax increases? Why not Obamacare? How about New York City's ""temporary"" rent control measures intended for veterans returning from World War II?)

Raising taxes only on the top 2 percent of income earners will do nothing to reduce the deficit. There's not enough money there -- even assuming, contrary to all known history, that the top 2 percent won't find ways to reduce their taxable income or that the imaginary increased government revenue would be applied to deficit reduction, anyway.

Apart from Obamacare, it's difficult to think of a more effective method of destroying jobs than raising taxes on ""the rich."" This isn't a wealth tax on useless gigolos like John Kerry -- it's an income tax on people who are currently engaged in some profitable enterprise. Their business profits, which could have been used to hire more employees, will instead be used to pay the government.

But Republicans are over a barrel. Unless Republicans and Democrats reach an agreement, the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year. By pushing to extend the tax cuts for everyone except ""the rich,"" Democrats get to look like champions of middle class tax cuts and Republicans can be portrayed as caring only about the rich.

And when the economy tanks, the Non-Fox Media will blame Republicans.

The economy will tank because, as you will recall, Obama is still president. Government rules, regulations, restrictions, forms and inspections are about to drown the productive sector. Obamacare is descending on job creators like a fly swatter on a gnat. Obama has already managed to produce the only ""recovery"" that is worse than the preceding recession since the Great Depression. And he says, ""You ain't seen nothing yet.""

The coming economic collapse is written in the stars, but if Republicans ""obstruct"" the Democrats by blocking tax hikes on top income earners, they're going to take 100 percent of the blame for the Obama economy.

You think not? The Non-Fox Media managed to persuade a majority of voters that the last four years of jobless misery was George W. Bush's fault, having nothing whatsoever to do with Obama.

The media have also managed to brand Republicans as the party of the rich, even as eight of the 10 richest counties voted for Obama. And that doesn't include pockets of vast wealth in cities -- Nob Hill in San Francisco, the North Shore of Chicago, the Upper East Side of Manhattan and the Back Bay of Boston -- whose residents invariably vote like welfare recipients. Seven of the 10 richest senators are Democrats. The very richest is the useless gigolo.

Republicans have a PR problem, not an economic theory problem. That doesn't mean they should cave on everything, but seeming to fight for ""tax cuts for the rich"" is a little close to the bone, no matter how tremendously counterproductive such taxes are.

Yes, conservatives can try harder to get the truth out, but as UCLA political science professor Tim Groseclose has shown, media bias already costs Republicans about 8 to 10 points in elections. Try arguing a year from now that Republicans' refusal to agree to tax hikes on the top 2 percent of income earners -- resulting in an expiration of all the Bush tax cuts -- had nothing to do with the inevitable economic disaster.

Republicans have got to make Obama own the economy.

They should spend from now until the end of the congressional calendar reading aloud from Thomas Sowell, Richard Epstein, John Lott and Milton Friedman and explaining why Obama's high tax, massive regulation agenda spells doom for the nation.

Then some Republicans can say: We think this is a bad idea, but Obama won the election and the media are poised to blame us for whatever happens next, so let's give his plan a whirl and see how the country likes it.

Republicans need to get absolute, 100 percent intellectual clarity on who bears responsibility for the next big recession. It is more important to win back the Senate in two years than it is to save the Democrats from their own idiotic tax plan. Unless Republicans give them an out, Democrats won't be able to hide from what they've done.

Even Democrats might back away from that deal."

VERBATIM: According to a new survey by LifeWay Research, the surge in illegal border crossings during the Biden administration is worrying Evangelical Christians. 80% want Congress to take action to stop the flow. Lifeway spokesman Scott McConnell says “The urgency continues to grow for Congress to act this year to improve laws around immigration.” The poll also finds that Evangelicals are concerned for the welfare of illegal aliens and want to share the gospel with them.

May 22 2023,"Debt Ceiling Talks, Inflation Data Loom Over Markets, Economy Ahead of Pivotal Meeting Between Biden and McCarthy",U.S. News & World Report,left,https://usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2023-05-22/debt-ceiling-talks-inflation-data-loom-over-markets-economy-ahead-of-pivotal-meeting-between-biden-and-mccarthy,"As a standoff over raising the nation’s debt limit captures the news cycle in Washington and Wall Street, there is also the question of what is happening to inflation hanging over the markets this week.



President Joe Biden returned to the U.S on Sunday from a successful meeting of the G7 leading industrial nations in Hiroshima, Japan, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a highly publicized guest appearance. Biden is scheduled to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Monday afternoon.

Staff for both sides met Sunday after the usual Washington drama of a walkout by Republican negotiators on Friday followed by finger-pointing from Biden and then McCarthy. But the two principals sounded somewhat hopeful ahead of the pivotal meeting after having talked Sunday as Biden was flying back on Air Force One.

“It went well,” Biden said late Sunday as he arrived at the White House. “We’ll talk tomorrow.”

Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen – who has emerged as the bad cop in the drama – kept the pressure on while Biden was out of the country.

“I indicated in my last letter to Congress that we expect to be unable to pay all of our bills in early June and possibly as soon as June 1. And I will continue to update Congress, but I certainly haven’t changed my assessment,” Yellen said in an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday. “So I think that that’s a hard deadline.”

Some experts believe the date could be a bit later, maybe after quarterly tax payments come in on June 15, giving the Treasury a few more weeks of wiggle room. But receipts have been coming in below expectations so far.

""Well, there’s always uncertainty about tax receipts and spending,"" Yellen said in response to a question from show host Chuck Todd. ""And so it’s hard to be absolutely certain about this, but my assessment is that the odds of reaching June 15th, while being able to pay all of our bills, is quite low.""

Yellen warned that some of the country’s bills will go unpaid if the debt ceiling isn’t raised as the Treasury prioritizes payments. In any case, any delay or even default would wreak havoc in the markets, likely driving yields on short-term bonds higher and prompting a sell-off of stocks.

On Monday, stock futures showed no sign of panic as they remained flat ahead of the market’s opening.

The debt fight is not the only wall of worry facing markets this week.

Reports on the state of the housing market come on Tuesday and Thursday, as there are signs it has stabilized with homebuilder confidence on the rise even as mortgage rates remain elevated.



The second estimate of gross domestic product for the second quarter comes out on Thursday, with expectations it will remain at an annual rate of 1.1%, while Friday brings the personal consumption expenditures price index for April. The measure of inflation is one the Fed pays special attention to and estimates are for it to show a slight rise as inflation proves to be stickier than the central bank would like. The core index, stripping out energy and food costs, is pegged to come in unchanged at 4.6% annually.

Since the May meeting, at which Chairman Jerome Powell announced an expected quarter point increase in interest rates while also hinting at a pause in the cycle of monetary tightening, Fed officials have tried to dampen market belief that interest rate cuts might be on the table later this year.

While inflation has continued to recede from last summer’s heights, it is also proving stickier to tame than some had anticipated.

“The effects of the substantial fiscal and monetary policy support offered in response to the pandemic as well as acute supply disruptions to goods and labor continue to linger, but are gradually fading,” Wells Fargo economists wrote on Monday. “However, the risks to our inflation outlook are skewed more to the upside than downside, in our view. Core measures continue to suggest that inflation is still wielding considerable momentum. Consumer spending and hiring have cooled in recent months but do not appear to be immediately petering out.”

However, Powell offered a ray of hope to the markets last week in a speech in Washington.

“Having come this far, we can afford to look at the data and the evolving outlook and make careful assessments,” Powell said, referring to the central bank’s 10 straight interest rate hikes, which have taken its short-term borrowing rate from essentially zero in March 2022 to about 5.1% now.

As the expected GDP number demonstrates, the economy remains in a growth mode, albeit a sluggish one. The labor market remains extremely tight, with unemployment at low levels not seen since 1969. That gives hope that a recession can be averted, or that it would be only a mild one.

“The bottom line is that households are not over indebted, are performing well on the debt they’ve already incurred and have ample capacity to take on more,” BCA Research wrote on Monday. “While there is a limit to how much households can prudently borrow, they’re nowhere near reaching it yet. Households have a light debt-service burden and can readily augment their wealth and income with credit. We do not see any credit obstacles preventing households from sustaining their consumption growth rate at a level that will keep the recession at bay for the rest of the year.”



All of that, though, remains under threat from gamesmanship over the debt ceiling. Some Democrats have said the Republicans actually want a recession, as it would hurt Biden ahead of the 2024 presidential election.

Former President Donald Trump, who is campaigning for a second stint in the White House, has urged GOP negotiators to hold firm on spending cuts even though a good chunk of the $31.4 trillion in debt was racked up during his term.

But Republicans appear to have made some progress with voters tarring Democrats with the big spender tag. A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research finds that only 33% of American adults approve of Biden’s handling of the economy while 24% say national economic conditions are in good shape."

Jun 20 2012,New Ads Trade Shots on the Economy,New York Times (News),left,http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/new-ads-trade-shots-on-the-economy/,"President Obama and several conservative groups are going head-to-head in a flurry of new attack ads, trading accusations over mishandled economic policies and inattention to the plight of struggling Americans.

Over the next week and a half, viewers in 10 battleground states will be hit with $33 million in advertising, part of an aggressive effort by Mr. Obama, Mitt Romney and three conservative advocacy groups to define their opponent before undecided voters make up their minds.

The Obama campaign released two television commercials on Wednesday that condemn Mitt Romney as a “corporate raider” who shipped jobs overseas, cut taxes for the wealthy and raised fees on the middle class. Both ads end with the campaign’s latest attack slogan, an attempt to turn Mr. Romney’s financial experience as a private equity executive into a liability: “Romney economics: it didn’t work then, and it won’t work now.”

The new advertising from Mr. Romney and the conservative groups — a $20 million offensive — takes aim at the president on two issues: his economic leadership and his health care overhaul plan, which the Supreme Court is set to rule on.

One ad that is running in six states as part of a $5 million effort by the Concerned Women for America features a female doctor who worries that the new health care law will force her to stop seeing some of her patients. “I’ve looked at this law. I know the consequences: delayed care and worse yet, denied care.”

No fewer than three new ads turn Mr. Obama’s recent verbal misfire — “the private sector is doing fine” — back on him. There are minor variations in style, but the ads all contain the same message: the president is out of touch. All three also have the same title, “Doing Fine.”

The Romney campaign, which has committed $3.4 million to television advertising through early next week, started its version of “Doing Fine” last week, a twist on a 2008 commercial from the Obama campaign that mocked Senator John McCain for uttering the ill-timed phrase “the fundamentals of our economy are strong” as the stock market was plummeting and the economy was collapsing.

Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney “super PAC,” started running its version this week as part of a $7.2 million buy, as did Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-affiliated group, with a $4.6 million buy.

The 10 states included in the latest spate of advertising are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia."

Sep 11 2018,Government borrowing soars despite robust economy,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/government-borrowing-soars-despite-robust-economy/2018/09/11/09a85554-b5eb-11e8-a7b5-adaaa5b2a57f_story.html?utm_term=.4cf8dc1d6b3f,"The U.S. budget deficit is reaching levels that are abnormally high for a robust economy, and lawmakers from both parties are proposing ideas that would make the deficit swell even further. The government spent $895 billion more than it brought in from taxes and other revenue sources during the past 11 months, the Congressional Budget Office said this week, a 33 percent increase from one year before.

Typically, the deficit shrinks during strong economic times, as the need for costly government support wanes and tax revenue rises. In 2000, the last time the unemployment rate was at its current level of 3.9 percent, the government ran a surplus, meaning tax revenue eclipsed all spending.

The dynamic is much different now.

Corporate tax receipts fell 30 percent in the past 11 months, the CBO said, precipitated by the large reduction in rates from the massive tax overhaul passed by Congress last year. Spending levels have risen sharply as a result of a bipartisan agreement to shed budget caps put in place to maintain fiscal discipline and pour more money into both military and domestic programs.

“It’s not just irresponsible, it’s wildly irresponsible,” said retired senator Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), who added that lawmakers are pushing the deficit higher because of political expediency.

“If you are seeking elective office, the hardest thing in the world is to say, ‘I’m going to raise your taxes or cut spending on popular programs,’ ” he said.

Among the Republicans, the loudest voices recently have come from outside Congress.

“With a booming economy, full employment, a soaring stock market and record asset values, we should be shrinking the deficit, not growing it,” Mitt Romney, a Republican and Senate candidate in Utah, wrote on his campaign website Monday. He said other conservatives have largely been “silent” on the issue since President Trump took office.

Yet there are signs the borrowing binge has only begun.

Leading House Republicans proposed an additional $646 billion in tax cuts this week — a number that could grow to roughly $2 trillion over a decade — and a growing number of prominent Democrats have proposed expanding access to government-sponsored health care, which could add trillions more.

A number of congressional Republicans have defended the tax law’s impact on the debt, saying they believe cutting taxes will ultimately lead to so much economic growth that it more than compensates for the loss in revenue.

“I think it’s a very modest investment in a dramatically better economy where, a lot of people in our country who really lost hope in finding a good-paying job, now have hope and are actively seeking those jobs,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) told reporters last week. “It’s an investment that is paying off.”

As the government borrows to plug the hole between revenue and spending — the deficit — it adds to the national debt by borrowing money. Lawmakers from both parties have said this saddles future generations of Americans with huge fiscal burdens, and it could also make it extremely difficult to respond to an unforeseen shock, such as a financial crisis, a natural disaster or a terrorist attack. And when the U.S. government borrows money, it often must turn to countries such as China for funding, at times complicating already tense relationships.

The government has $21.5 trillion in debt, up from $12.8 trillion in 2010, when a fiscal commission led by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles sought ways to reduce the deficit.

And the cost of maintaining this debt is snowballing, driven higher not just by spending but also by rising interest rates.

The government is projected to spend $390 billion on interest payments alone next year, an amount almost equivalent to its entire $401 billion budget for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, according to the CBO.

Congressional Republicans spent much of the Obama administration decrying deficits and forcing restrictions on spending. They largely abandoned those sentiments when Trump took office, as he expressed little interest in continuing the budget fights that endured since 2011.

Trump has prioritized ways to temporarily jolt economic growth as part of his agenda, arguing it will create more jobs. And there are signs the economy has picked up steam, with consumer and business sentiment reaching much higher levels.

But the deficit is also reaching much higher levels. Taken together, the tax cuts and new spending levels are expected to add more than $5 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for budget discipline.

“It is amazing that things are so much worse and yet people care so much less,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the group.

The deficit is projected to reach 4.2 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from 2.5 percent in 2015. The economy is expected to grow by about 3 percent this year, a higher level than in past years, but still not as fast as the deficit. And the deficit has not been this large with an unemployment rate this low in modern history, according to White House data.

When asked about the deficit by his former National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn, Trump replied, “Just run the presses — print money,” according to Bob Woodward’s new book, “Fear.” (The White House has denied much of Woodward’s characterization of Trump in the book.)

As a candidate, Trump promised to eliminate the debt by the time he left office. But his aides have said they don’t intend to pursue such a course. And Trump’s most recent budget proposal fell short of even eliminating the deficit over the next 10 years.

Brady and other Republicans have defended the push for tax cuts, saying it will help the economy and dismissing reports of its impact on the debt.

This viewpoint, though, is disputed by many economists, including those at the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which have found that the tax cuts will add more than $1 trillion to the debt.

“The problem with the national debt is that a day of reckoning is inevitable, but it’s not imminent as far as anybody knows,” said former congressman John Tanner, a Tennessee Democrat who co-founded the centrist Blue Dog Democrats. “And so our political system — from my experience — deals more with problems that are imminent than it does with problems that are inevitable sometime in the future.”

Trump has vowed to protect Medicare and Social Security, two of the most expensive government programs, from any cuts. Combined, those programs account for $1.7 trillion of the government’s $4.1 trillion budget this year. This has drawn criticism from some Republicans, who have long argued that such entitlement programs represent a grave threat to the nation’s long-term financial stability.

“This will require presidential leadership,” said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). “We didn’t get it out of the Obama administration; we haven’t gotten it out of this administration.”

Washington’s embrace of widening deficits during a strong economy has drawn some criticism from a handful of Senate candidates from both parties, though it’s unclear what they might be able to do about it if they win their November races.

Former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, a Democrat who is running for the Senate, wrote in a Twitter post Tuesday that huge deficits had become a “structural” component of the government’s budget."

Apr 28 2022,Major disappointment: Economy shrank at 1.4% annual rate in first quarter,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-contracted-at-1-4-annual-rate-in-first-quarter,"GDP contracted at a 1.4% annualized rate in the first quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Thursday morning, meaning that slowing commerce added to the woes of high inflation.

The decline in GDP, which is adjusted for inflation, is a major reversal from the previous quarter, when growth soared to a 6.9% rate as businesses began healing faster from the pandemic. It’s the first such contraction since the second quarter of 2020, when the economy suffered the massive shock of coronavirus shutdowns.

Friday’s report means that President Joe Biden now has to contend with bad GDP numbers, in addition to the soaring inflation that has strained households and driven down his approval ratings. Inflation rose to 8.5% in March, according to the consumer price index.

Still, details within Thursday’s report showed that underlying momentum is stronger than the headline number would make it seem.

ANXIOUS FED SET FOR HISTORIC MEASURE TO TRY TO CURB INFLATION

“This contraction is seen as less worrisome because it reflects a widening trade deficit and big swings in inventories, along with a decline in government spending,” said Mark Hamrick, the senior economic analyst for Bankrate. “Key drivers including consumer and business spending have been holding up.”

Consumer spending grew at a healthy 2.7% annual rate.

The decline in GDP was instead driven by factors that do not relate to future growth. Specifically, much of the decline in the first quarter was driven by a decline in exports and a sharp increase in imports, which subtract from the headline GDP number. A decline in businesses buying inventories also shaved about 0.8 percentage points from the overall GDP growth rate.

A measure of economic growth in Friday’s report that strips out those factors, final sales to private domestic purchasers, grew at a strong 3.7% annual rate.

Other economic data suggest that the economy, for now, has some momentum despite the formation of some serious headwinds. Monthly job gains have been strong. Claims for unemployment benefits, seen as a high-frequency gauge of layoffs, have been running at the lowest rates in decades.

Overall, the outlook is one of an economy that still features too much spending generating too much inflation. Friday’s report is not likely to dissuade the Federal Reserve from taking historic steps to tighten monetary policy."

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 workers in September as the unemployment rate fell to 4.8%, the Labor Department said Friday. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting the addition of 500,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate to slip to 5.1%.

The jobs gains in August were revised up to 366,000 from 235,000.

""The labor market recovery continues to hit the brakes this month, but is far from completely stopping,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. ""Despite the soft September report, there's still a case for optimism in the coming months, as we are beginning to look in the rearview mirror, and the peak of the Delta wave’s repercussions is behind us.""

President Biden addressed the report Friday and defended his record on the economy as ""progress.""

""In total, the job creation in the first eight months of my administration is nearly five million jobs,"" Biden said. ""Jobs up, wages up, unemployment down. That's progress.""

The September report was the first since the $300 per week in supplemental unemployment benefits expired on September 5. Economists are still assessing the impact of the Child Tax Credit, which pays families up to $3,600 per child per year. Also having an impact going forward will be the mandatory vaccine requirements being enforced by a growing number of companies.

Notable job gains occurred in leisure and hospitality (+74,000) were led by the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector (+43,000). Hiring in food services and drinking places was little changed for a second straight month after averaging a monthly gain of 197,000 from January through July. Professional and business services (+60,000), retail trade (+56,000), and transportation and warehousing (+47,000) also saw sizable gains.

Both local government education (-144,000) and state government education (-17,000) lost jobs last month.

The number workers reentering the labor force decreased by 198,000 last month to 2.3 million. The labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.6%, and was 1.7 percentage points below its February 2020 level. The rate has held between 61.4% and 61.7% since June 2020.

Average hourly earnings rose 0.6% in September and was up 4.6% year over year. Economists were expecting a 0.4% monthly increase and a 4.6% year over year gain.

""After looking like almost a done deal, today’s jobs number has thrown expectations for tapering into disarray,"" said Principal Global Investors Chief Strategist Seema Shah, adding that the hotter-than-expected hourly wage growth presents the Fed with a ""real conundrum.""

The Fed will hold a two-day meeting that concludes on November 3. The central bank could, at that point, announce plans to taper its $120 billion per month of asset purchases. A rate hike is not expected until late next year."

The new numbers were more than expected, bolstering the arguments of those who say the country’s economic recovery still has a way to go. Thursday’s jobless claims number was more than forecasters’ expectations of 320,000. The previous week saw 336,500 people applying for unemployment insurance for the first time.

“Progress on new claims for jobless benefits was not to be in the latest snapshot, posting a second straight weekly increase,” said Bankrate senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick. “The economy still has some heavy lifting to do under the presumption that further progress will be made in the coming months while putting the pandemic behind.”

Thursday’s numbers come after a rough August jobs report that fell well short of forecasters’ expectations. The economy added just 235,000 new jobs last month, well below the 750,000 that were expected. The overall unemployment rate dropped slightly from 5.4% to 5.2%.

POWELL VOWS FED WILL ‘MAKE CHANGES’ AFTER TRADING CONTROVERSY

Millions are still unemployed compared to pre-pandemic when the country’s unemployment rate dipped as low as 3.5% — its lowest level in decades. The delta variant of COVID-19 has been posing obstacles for the economy, which has been grappling with surging cases of the virus that have led to certain industries such as leisure and hospitality to once again feel the weight of the pandemic.

The report comes a day after the Federal Reserve revised down its expectations of employment and gross domestic product growth for this year.

It changed its GDP prediction from 7% in 2021 to its 5.9% prediction from June and slashed its growth forecast from 3.8% to 3.3% for next year. In terms of unemployment, the central bank’s June forecast for 4.8% unemployment this year was revised down to 4.5%. It kept its employment projections for the next few years the same.

Apr 11 2022,Higher interest rates could blunt two big problems in the economy,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/04/11/fed-inflation-job-market/,"There are two troubling forces threatening the economy right now, both consequences of the covid pandemic. Prices are surging to levels not seen in 40 years. And turmoil in the labor market continues to pinch businesses — there just aren’t enough people filling open jobs. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In Nashville, Dependable Delivery is feeling the strain on both ends. The courier service has raised prices and added a fuel surcharge to keep up with the escalating cost of gas and new vehicles. The company’s president, Dave Myers, said the price bumps are key to retaining his staff of nearly 40 full- and part-time drivers, who are in high demand in such a tight labor market.

“It’s barely sustainable,” Myers said. He called the dynamics swirling around his business “a balancing act.”

In recent weeks, policymakers at the Federal Reserve have outlined a fix they say can help address both problems plaguing the economy. In public remarks, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell and his colleagues argued that a steady series of seven rate hikes this year can not only bring down soaring inflation, but can also help reset the job market by cooling off demand for labor.

Higher interest rates are the Fed’s go-to mechanism for tackling inflation, as they make the cost of borrowing or investing more expensive, and can put a damper on spending by both households and businesses. If companies decide they don’t need as many employees, then the current high demand for workers could also ease up.

Powell and other Fed officials hope their plan can balance out the job market and help address a worker shortage that’s become a fraught feature of the recovery. Americans continued to switch jobs at near-record rates in February, with 4.4 million workers leaving their positions, according to recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Powell often cites the fact that there are about 1.7 job openings for each person looking for work.

“So that’s a very, very tight labor market, tight to an unhealthy level, I would say,” Powell said last month. “The idea is we’re trying to better align demand and supply, let’s just say in the labor market. … If you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on wages. You would have a lot less of a labor shortage.”

Yet the Fed’s plan — cutting inflation, making fewer jobs available — tackles the demand side of the economy. Rate hikes alone can’t increase the supply of workers or assuage peoples’ fears of getting sick from covid. They can’t provide child care for working parents, change immigration policy or entice early retirees — some 2.6 million by some estimates — back into the labor force.

“The Fed’s tools are designed much more around encouraging employers to want to hire than at getting people to want to work,” said Jason Furman, who served as a senior economist in the Obama administration. “I think our labor market is too tight, but the solution isn’t to have less employment, but more people who want to work.”

Economists also say the Fed’s plan will be extremely difficult to pull off given the uncertainty of the post-pandemic world. Russia’s invasion has roiled global energy markets, with the widespread expectation that American households will feel the sting at the gas pump. Recent covid shutdowns at major Chinese manufacturing hubs have also renewed global supply chain woes, and offer a sobering reminder of the pandemic’s ongoing economic threat.

Lower prices are a top priority for millions who did return to work. Last month, Willie Price was called back to her longtime job after a pandemic layoff in spring 2020. Price, 62, has worked in food service at the Library of Congress for 42 years, and during the pandemic she scraped by, thanks to her morning paper route and other odd jobs. But she’s relied on her Library of Congress job to care for herself and her son.

She now earns $20.37 per hour — a small increase from before the pandemic — but said the pay doesn’t go nearly as far as before. She used to spend $135 a month for a parking spot, but now the garage she has to park in costs $400. She’s also paying for more gas to drive to Capitol Hill from her house in Maryland. And groceries cost so much more: She likes to cook salmon, shrimp and chicken, but now the “things that you like to eat are too expensive to eat.” Even with her old job at the Library of Congress finally back, Price said she doesn’t feel like the economy is working for her.

“I work from paycheck to paycheck to do what I got to do,” Price said. “I don’t have a big lump sum in the bank.”

Complicating this twin goal of tackling inflation and recalibrating the job market is that the Fed must do it all without causing businesses to lay people off or triggering a new recession. The Fed has an uneven track record of raising rates to cool down the economy just enough — many economists point only to 1994, when the Fed managed to hike interest rates and slow growth without causing the economy to contract altogether.

History has often gone the other way. Since 1961, the Fed has launched nine full cycles of rate hikes to combat inflation. Recessions followed eight of those tries, according to research from the investment bank Piper Sandler.

“What Powell is saying is ‘this time is gonna be different,’ ” said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and now head of global policy at Piper Sandler. “Maybe there will be a time when it’s different. But that’s always a dangerous thing to say.”

Furman agreed that the Fed would be hard-pressed to cut inflation without causing consequences for the job market, saying: “The only thing I’m sure would work to lower inflation is an increasing unemployment rate.”

In a speech last month, Powell argued that the central bank’s track record with rate hikes was somewhat better, pointing to 1965 and 1984 as other instances in which the Fed fought overheating without putting the economy in trouble. And no one at the Fed says its plan will be easy to pull off. Interest rates can’t target specific gaps in the economy, and even back-to-back rate hikes operate with a lag.

Regardless, the economic expansion could depend on the Fed’s ability to get prices and the job market back to resembling something more normal.

“We need to get inflation under control for both sides of the mandate,” Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told reporters on a call in March. “If we want to sustain healthy labor markets, the best thing we can do is sustain the expansion, and that means it’s incumbent upon us to get inflation under control.”

Today’s economic forces are practically the opposite of what policymakers faced two years ago, when 20 million people lost their jobs and the Fed slashed rates to zero to help rescue the economy. For much of the pandemic, Fed leaders put off raising rates so the job market could have as much room as possible to heal. And until 2021, inflation wasn’t much of a problem. Powell and his colleagues focused on getting jobs back to their pre-pandemic strength, when a tight labor market lifted those who too often fell on the economy’s margins.

But the labor market of 2022 is showing a different kind of tightness, one that many policymakers and economists argue is fundamentally out of whack. As businesses hunt for workers, wages are rising, putting pressure on overall prices. At their policy meeting in March, Fed officials noted that their business contacts across the country reported having to pass on wage increases and the rising cost of doing business to customers. Economists warn that such a wage-price spiral can be an ever harder form of inflation for the Fed to interrupt.

At the same time, workers’ pay bumps have been rapidly eroded by the cost of basic necessities. Price increases have spread to every pocket of the economy, with the cost of gasoline, shelter and food driving the highest inflation in four decades. Economists don’t expect home prices or rent to fall anytime soon, and the war in Ukraine is dealing yet another blow to global energy and food prices.

The twin pressures of labor shortages and inflation have been particularly tough on restaurants, which depend on in-person contact and have been gutted by waves of the virus. The industry hasn’t recovered 820,000 jobs that were lost in the pandemic, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The pandemic shuttered three of Tyler Akin’s four restaurants on the East Coast, and he largely blames Congress for not providing enough relief to keep his industry afloat. Lately, he’s struggled to find enough staff for his French brasserie at the Hotel Du Pont in Wilmington, Del. Hiring bonuses, and paying to have a “preferred listing” on the job site Indeed, are now “a fixed cost of doing business,” he said.

That’s on top of the rising cost of staying open, Akin said. Packaging has become more expensive, as restaurants rely on takeout orders. Basic ingredients, especially proteins, are constantly going up in price. Then there’s the constant need to pivot with waves of the virus, since customer demand can drop off, then rebound so suddenly.

“The cost of labor is quite a bit higher, so you have these two forces — cost of goods inflation and labor cost inflation — that are creating the perfect storm,” Akin said."
Apr 11 2022,"Ukraine economy to shrink by almost half this year, World Bank forecasts",The Guardian,left,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/ukraine-economy-gdp-russia-invasion-world-bank-forecast,"Ukraine’s economy is on course to contract by almost half this year as the Russian invasion and the impact of a “deep humanitarian crisis” takes its toll, the World Bank has said.

With a blockade of Black Sea ports in the south of Ukraine and the havoc caused to industry in the east, the war-torn country’s GDP is projected to shrink by about 45% in 2022.

The Washington-based development organisation said Russia would also fall into recession and many countries surrounding Ukraine would suffer severe hardship, with some pushed to seek outside help from international agencies to prevent them defaulting on existing debts.

“The war is having a devastating impact on human life and causing economic destruction in both countries, and will lead to significant economic losses in the Europe and central Asia region and the rest of the world,” the World Bank said in its forecast published on Sunday.

The Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will host finance ministers and central bank bosses at their annual spring meetings this week.

David Malpass, the president of the World Bank, and the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, are expected to say they plan to offer extra financial support to countries affected by the invasion, many of which are suffering spiralling food costs.

Last month, Georgieva said it was unlikely the war would trigger a global financial crisis, but warned of a severe recession in many countries close to the conflict.

The Bank said the second major shock in two years, after the pandemic, would lead to a 4.1% decline in economic output across the region – twice as steep as the recession in 2020 from the Covid-19 crisis.

The World Bank’s Europe and central Asia regional data stretches from Ireland in the west to the Russian Federation in the east, but the report focused on emerging and developing countries in central and eastern Europe, the Balkans, Turkey and the former Soviet republics.

It said the ripple effects of the war would hit many of the former Soviet republics hardest and many would be forced to seek further loans from the World Bank and the IMF to remain solvent.

Lending to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic has already increased during the pandemic, the Bank said, though it highlighted Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic as the most vulnerable and in need of further packages of financial support.

The Russian Federation economy is forecast to shrink by 11.2% this year, while output among eastern European countries – including Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine – is expected to be dragged 30.7% lower.

Ukraine’s economy, which depends heavily on agriculture, could be hit further if all access to the Black Sea is cut off by Russian forces, the report said.

Ukraine’s ports have already suffered a fall in traffic of more than 75% and the capture of Odesa, if it were to happen, could push that figure higher.

Sanctions mean that the number of ships arriving in Russian ports is down by almost half since the start of the invasion, leading to a knock-on effect on neighbouring countries that depend on Russian and Ukrainian exports. A decline in remittances – cash sent home by workers living abroad – has also hit the wider region.

“The war’s impacts are cascading through the region’s strong trade, financial and migration linkages, resulting in considerable economic damage to neighbouring countries,” the World Bank report said.

A continuation of the war would probably force the World Bank to revise its forecasts and predict even larger falls in GDP.

It said a downside scenario could include an extra three-percentage-point decline across the euro area in 2022, “reflecting the impact of commodity price shocks from escalation of the war. In turn, this triggers additional sanctions and reduces Russian exports to the euro area.

“The downside scenario also assumes a shock to financial confidence, a 20% contraction in Russia’s GDP, and a 75% contraction in Ukraine’s GDP.”

Turkey’s economy, which has come under strain from high levels of inflation and rising unemployment, is predicted to grow by 1.4% this year."
Jan 08 2021,Economy lost 140K jobs in December as pandemic worsened,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/economy-unemployment-140k-jobs-december,"The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, the first losses since April, reflecting renewed economic closures amid a worsening coronavirus pandemic that has infected more than 21.5 million people in the United States and killed more than 365,000.

The unemployment rate remained flat at 6.7%.

“It has never been more true that the path of the economy depends on the course of the virus, and right now, new Covid outbreaks across the nation are threatening to bring the economy down with it,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG.

Employment in the leisure and hospitality sector declined by 498,000 jobs. Of those losses, 372,000 came from the restaurant industry alone. Those steep losses were offset in part by gains in business services, retail trade, construction, and transportation and warehousing.

Since February, the leisure and hospitality industry has shed 3.9 million jobs — roughly 23%.

The coronavirus pandemic and restrictions implemented to address surging cases have devastated the entertainment industry, particularly restaurants — a situation made worse by temperatures across much of the country remaining too cold for patrons to enjoy outdoor dining.

The U.S. also lost tens of thousands of education jobs as schools remain closed for in-person instruction and states and local governments faced cutbacks.

The labor market has so far recovered about half the 22 million jobs lost in the spring due to the pandemic.

“Rising COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations, and deaths means our health and economic woes are far from over,” Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, wrote. “President-elect Biden enters his first term in a disastrous economy.”

The $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package passed in December likely had little to no effect on December’s numbers but could set up for a stronger recovery effort in January — Congress didn’t approve the measure until Dec. 21, and President Trump didn’t sign the package until Dec. 28.

More than one-third of the bill was directed toward loan programs for small businesses that have not been able to weather lockdowns and the recent surges in COVID-19 cases. The measure also included a $300 boost in unemployment benefits, half what Congress provided in the early months of the pandemic, and $600 stimulus checks for individuals, in addition to funds for schools, healthcare facilities, rental assistance programs, and food stamps.

President-elect Joe Biden has already called the pared-down spending package a “down payment” on an ambitious recovery program and has said that he was confident of multiple relief packages being passed in 2021.

That goal became more attainable Wednesday after both Democratic candidates running in Georgia’s Senate runoff elections, Rev. Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff, ousted their Republican incumbents — shifting the balance of power in the upper chamber to an even 50-50 split, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote nudging the chamber in the Democrats’ favor. Ahead of Georgia’s election, both Warnock and Ossoff made increased federal relief, specifically $2,000 checks, a key part of their campaigns.

Also arriving too late to be reflected in December’s numbers was the rollout of Pfizer-BioNTech’s and Moderna’s vaccines across the U.S. So far, roughly 6 million people have been vaccinated across the country, with 15 million vaccines distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many consider a successful vaccination campaign to be integral to an eventual return to pre-pandemic economic activity."

Sep 14 2022,European Union ‘Social Market Economy’ Might Redistribute Fossil Fuel Profits,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/european-union-social-market-economy-might-redistribute-fossil-fuel-profits,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday that the European Union might redistribute profits from fossil fuel companies and impose energy consumption limits.

The bloc is currently weighing various measures to help member states cope with a freeze in Russian energy exports — including natural gas shipments through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which Russia paused in reaction to Western support of Ukraine. In her State of the Union address, von der Leyen asserted that Russia is largely responsible for the energy crisis.

“Russia keeps on actively manipulating our energy market,” von der Leyen said, noting that natural gas prices have recently increased more than tenfold. “But Europeans are also coping courageously with this.”

Multiple European countries are imposing regulations for thermostat and appliance usage. However, von der Leyen announced that she would propose standards for European Union member states to reduce “overall electricity consumption,” funded by redistributing profits from energy companies.

“We are proposing a cap on the revenues of companies that produce electricity at a low cost. These companies are making revenues they never accounted for, they never even dreamt of,” von der Leyen said. “In our social market economy, profits are good. But in these times it is wrong to receive extraordinary record profits benefitting from war and on the back of consumers. In these times, profits must be shared and channeled to those who need it the most.”

Russian shipments accounted for 40% of the European natural gas supply last year — a rate that has since dropped to 9%. However, Germany — the continent’s largest economy — has seen dependence decrease from 55% to 35%.

Von der Leyen argued that fossil fuel producers have a “special duty” to aid with the crisis. “Major oil, gas and coal companies are also making huge profits. So they have to pay a fair share — they have to give a crisis contribution,” she added. “These are all emergency and temporary measures we are working on, including our discussions on price caps.”

The European Union, in accordance with the European Green Deal and the Paris Climate Agreement, abides by the official goal of becoming “a climate-neutral society” by 2050.

Though von der Leyen acknowledged last week that low hydropower generation caused by droughts is partially responsible for high energy prices in Europe, she said that “the climate crisis” is the ultimate impetus for the weather conditions and called for the elimination of all fossil fuel dependence.

“Half a century ago, in the 1970s, the world faced another fossil fuel crisis. Some of us remember the car-free weekends to save energy. Yet we kept driving on the same road. We did not get rid of our dependency on oil. And worse, fossil fuels were even massively subsidized,” she continued. “This was wrong, not just for the climate, but also for our public finances, and our independence. And we are still paying for this today. Only a few visionaries understood that the real problem was fossil fuels themselves, not just their price.”

In a departure from other European leaders, however, incoming British Prime Minister Liz Truss proposed legislation last week to open the North Sea for oil and gas drilling, as well as to facilitate the construction of more nuclear power plants. Other countries, such as Germany and Switzerland, have been slowly shuttering their remaining nuclear facilities in reaction to the 2011 meltdown in Fukushima, Japan.

“Energy policy over the past decades has not focused enough on securing supply,” Truss told the House of Commons. “All of this has left us vulnerable to volatile global markets and malign actors in an increasingly geopolitical world.”"
Jun 06 2023,"Saudi Arabia plans to reduce how much oil it sends to global economy, meaning US oil prices may rise",Fox News (Online News),right,https://foxnews.com/world/saudi-arabia-plans-reduce-how-much-oil-sends-global-economy-meaning-us-oil-prices-may-rise,"Saudi Arabia will reduce how much oil it sends to the global economy, taking a unilateral step to prop up the sagging price of crude after two previous cuts to supply by major producing countries in the OPEC+ alliance failed to push oil higher.

The Saudi cut of 1 million barrels per day, to start in July, comes as the other OPEC+ producers agreed in a meeting in Vienna to extend earlier production cuts through next year.

Calling the reduction a ""lollipop,"" Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said at a news conference that ""we wanted to ice the cake."" He said the cut could be extended and that the group ""will do whatever is necessary to bring stability to this market.""

The new cut would likely push up oil prices in the short term, but the impact after that would depend on whether Saudi Arabia decides to extend it, said Jorge Leon, senior vice president of oil markets research at Rystad Energy.

SAUDI ARABIA EXECUTES 2 ALLEGED BAHRAINI MILITANTS AFTER 'GROSSLY UNFAIR' TRIAL

The move provides ""a price floor because the Saudis can play with the voluntary cut as much as they like,"" he said.

The slump in oil prices has helped U.S. drivers fill their tanks more cheaply and gave consumers worldwide some relief from inflation.

""Gas is not going to become cheaper,"" Leon said. ""If anything, it will become marginally more expensive.""

That the Saudis felt another cut was necessary underlines the uncertain outlook for demand for fuel in the months ahead. There are concerns about economic weakness in the U.S. and Europe, while China’s rebound from COVID-19 restrictions has been less robust than many had hoped.

Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer in the OPEC oil cartel, was one of several members that agreed on a surprise cut of 1.6 million barrels per day in April. The kingdom’s share was 500,000. That followed OPEC+ announcing in October that it would slash 2 million barrels per day, angering U.S. President Joe Biden by threatening higher gasoline prices a month before the midterm elections.

All told, OPEC+ has now dropped production on paper by 4.6 million barrels a day. But some countries can't produce their quotas, so the actual reduction is around 3.5 million barrels per day, or over 3% of global supply.

The previous cuts gave little lasting boost to oil prices. International benchmark Brent crude climbed as high as $87 per barrel but has given up its post-cut gains and been loitering below $75 per barrel in recent days. U.S. crude has recently dipped below $70.

SAUDI ARABIA INVITES SYRIAN PRESIDENT TO ARAB SUMMIT IN OIL-RICH KINGDOM

That has helped U.S. drivers kicking off the summer travel season, with prices at the pump averaging $3.55, down $1.02 from a year ago, according to auto club AAA. Falling energy prices also helped inflation in the 20 European countries that use the euro drop to the lowest level since before Russia invaded Ukraine.

The Saudis need sustained high oil revenue to fund ambitious development projects aimed at diversifying the country’s economy.

The International Monetary Fund estimates the kingdom needs $80.90 per barrel to meet its envisioned spending commitments, which include a planned $500 billion futuristic desert city project called Neom.

The U.S. recently announced oil purchases to replenish its Strategic Petroleum Reserve — after Biden announced the largest release from the reserve in American history last year — in an indicator that U.S. officials may be less worried about OPEC cuts than in months past.

While oil producers like Saudi Arabia need revenue to fund their state budgets, they also have to take into account the impact of higher prices on oil-consuming countries.

Oil prices that go too high can fuel inflation, sapping consumer purchasing power and pushing central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve toward further interest rate hikes that can slow economic growth.

The Saudi production cut and any increase to oil prices could add to the profits that are helping Russia pay for its war against Ukraine. Russia has found new oil customers in India, China and Turkey amid Western sanctions designed to limit Moscow’s crucial energy income.

However, higher crude prices risk complicating trade by the world’s No. 3 oil producer if they exceed the $60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven major democracies.

Russia has found ways to evade the price cap through ""dark fleet"" tankers, which tamper with location data or transfer oil from ship to ship to disguise its origin. But those efforts add costs.

Under the OPEC+ deal, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Moscow will extend its voluntary cut of 500,000 barrels a day through next year, according to Russian state news agency Tass.

But Russia might not be following through on its promises. Moscow’s total exports of oil and refined products such as diesel fuel rose in April to a post-invasion high of 8.3 million barrels per day, the International Energy Agency said in its April oil market report."

Dec 29 2020,Stimulus checks are fixing a problem the economy doesn't have,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/stimulus-checks-are-fixing-a-problem-the-economy-doesnt-have,"It’s not true that economist Larry Summers is always right — contrary to the belief of Larry Summers. However, he’s bright enough that we should always take note of what he’s saying. At the moment, he’s saying that the new round of stimulus checks is a mistake , and in this, he’s right.

It may be surprising, but household incomes are actually hardly down at all this year. We do have economic problems, but people not having money isn’t one of them. Thus, giving people money doesn’t solve the problems we have. In more technical terms, we are not in the standard Keynesian recession in which there is not enough demand. We are, instead, in one in which there are certain things that cannot be done — it’s a supply-side problem. This is why the savings rate has leaped this year. People have money but cannot spend it as they would wish: restaurants, bars, theater, vacations, live music, and the rest.

Sending out checks with money the Treasury Department doesn’t have doesn’t solve this problem.

What we do need to do is solve the supply problem: Get the Food and Drug Administration to take out its golden scissors and cut the red tape that’s holding back more vaccines from being approved and available.

We then have a further, more minor, problem, which is that some things simply won’t return to normal. Online shopping has taken a leap forward, and fewer physical stores are needed — along with all their jobs. More employers will allow or encourage more people to work from home because we’ve found out that we can do it. That means less commuting and fewer offices, with all the infrastructure and employment changes those mean, and so on.

We need to have an adaptive, flexible economy to redeploy those economic assets. But this is, again, something that more money in pockets doesn’t deal with. Less government would help, but given the coming change in the White House, that probably isn’t gonna happen.

Stimulus checks just aren’t what is needed. It’s possible to support it on a libertarian basis: Any time the government gives us more of our money back is good. This does, I’m afraid, sort of fail, though, because they’re just printing the money, through quantitative easing, to send it to us, which means they’ll have to take it back off us in the future. This will happen either to kill the resultant inflation, if we like Modern Monetary Theory, or to pay off the debt, if we’re more traditional. Either theory leads to the same place: cash now but higher taxes in the future. Note that we can’t use the Keynesian idea that more now leads to a larger economy to pay off the debt because we’re not in that demand-constrained Keynesian world.

However, there is one bright spot. There really is no money left. There’s not even enough to pay for all the things we’ve already promised ourselves through government. The Treasury Department has got nothing to pay for any new ideas. This means we can’t, in fact, have any new ideas nor more government. We can’t even raise taxes to pay for lovely new things as we’re already going to have to raise them to pay for what we’ve already had. Sure, that means those tax bills are going to hurt, but at least we know there won’t be any more impositions from Washington. Liberal politics are going to be isometric exercises for years to come because there just isn’t any money left for them to waste.

Sep 02 2022,"Labor market added 315,000 jobs in August, a bright spot in the economy",Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/09/02/august-jobs-report/,"The U.S. labor market added 315,000 jobs last month, hitting a 20-month streak in strong job growth that’s powering an economy through ominously high inflation. The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 3.7 percent, according to a monthly jobs report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Some 344,000 more people were unemployed than in July, partly because more workers rejoined the labor force, newly looking for work.

The August jobs gains were far lower than the stellar July job growth, when half a million people found work. Still, the labor market remains an area of strength for the economy, especially as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to rein in blistering inflation, which is weighing on the housing sector.

Financial markets initially traded higher on Friday’s jobs news, as investors hoped the strong but not-too-strong data might steer the Federal Reserve toward milder interest rate hikes. But the markets traded lower later in the day.

The report was welcome news to President Biden, who has struggled in the polls most of this year, with Americans frustrated by inflation being at 40-year highs. The jobs report combined with signs that inflation may have peaked could signal that the economy is on the road to stability.

“We received more good news in August,” Biden said in comments at the White House. “The great American jobs machine continues its comeback. American workers are back to work, earning more [in] manufacturing, building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. With today’s news, we have now created nearly 10 million new jobs since I took office.”

Indeed, the economy has more than recovered the 20 million jobs lost during the pandemic.

The biggest gains were in professional and business services, which added 68,000 jobs last month, shooting past its pre-pandemic numbers. There was a big jobs boost in computer systems design, management and technical consulting, and architectural and engineering services, while legal services lost 9,000 positions. This growth helps quell chatter of a looming downturn, triggered by reports of layoffs this summer at tech and other blue chip companies such as Snapchat, 3M, T-Mobile and Bed Bath & Beyond.

Employment in health care rose by 48,000 jobs, with notable additions in doctors’ offices, hospitals, and nursing and residential-care facilities. Retail trade added 44,000 jobs, and manufacturing continued to trend up by 22,000 positions.

There was little change in leisure and hospitality after average monthly job gains of 90,000 in the first seven months of the year. The industry still remains below its pre-pandemic levels by 7 percent.

“We want an orderly cool-down and this was a Goldilocks report,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. “These job gains weren’t too hot or too cold. They’re hitting that softish landing we want to see.”

Average hourly wages increased by 10 cents, or 0.3 percent, for private-sector workers last month, to $32.36 an hour, a slowdown compared with previous monthly gains. Over the past year, average hourly wages have increased by 5.2 percent.

Ronnette Lark, 44, who works in housekeeping at the Harrah’s Casino in Atlantic City recently earned a $3-an-hour raise in her union contract, bringing her up to $19 an hour. Earlier this year, rising prices had forced her to cut snacks, beef and yogurt out of her budget, but the pay increase has meant that she can afford a larger variety of foods and to take her daughter out for summer activities.

“This raise means a lot,” Lark said. “It means I could take my daughter out to [amusement parks] and a Trolls concert in Philadelphia. It means this summer was better than last summer.”

The labor force participation rate also ticked up by 0.3 percent last month, to 62.4 percent, a sign that more Americans are looking to return to work. But that figure remains below its February 2020 levels, frustrating employers facing severe labor shortages.

“The jobs market is strong. One thing that jumps out from this jobs report is that we’ve seen an uptick in labor participation, too,” Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said. “People are going to ask: How long are these strong reports going to continue? If we can get more participation from that workforce, that will help us.”

Economists say the uptick in unemployment should not be a cause for concern given that stronger labor force participation could mean more workers are actively looking for jobs.

“We see labor force participation coming back and that’s a good thing,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, senior economist at Indeed. “If we have increasing participation but not all people have a job yet, that means unemployment will rise. My assumption is these people back to participating will be able to find jobs quickly.”

And women workers between 25 and 54 joined the labor force at a particularly strong clip last month. Women in particular have faced challenges reentering the workforce since the pandemic because of increasingly inaccessible child care. The women’s workforce participation rate, however, still lags behind pre-pandemic levels.

“Prime-age women saw some of the biggest declines in workforce participation during the pandemic,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at Indeed, noting that last month’s increase could be a sign that trend is reversing. “Many, many women throughout the country are on the margins between working and not working, and what they make at work barely covers child care that allows them to work, so often there’s no net benefit to them working.”

July’s report shocked economists, with the economy adding 528,000 jobs (although that figure was officially revised down to 526,000), more than double forecasters’ expectations. Last month’s more tempered report shows signs that the Fed is beginning to achieve that soft landing.

Meanwhile, other indicators, such as a decline in economic output and persistent higher prices for just about everything, paint a less rosy picture, raising questions about how much longer the hot job market can last.

These mixed signals have led some economists to predict that workers will eventually face a weaker job market, especially if there is a recession. And although inflation eased slightly while remaining high in July and workers have continued to see historic wage growth this summer, paychecks have not kept up with inflation, hitting low-income households the hardest.

Industries that are more sensitive to interest rate increases, including construction, durable goods production, mortgages and temporary help services, will see a decline in jobs first if the labor market weakens, economists say.

“When we stop seeing growth in those industries, that’s when you think the first shoe is beginning to drop. It hasn’t yet,” said Erica Groshen, an economics adviser at Cornell University and commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics from 2013 to 2017.

The strength of the job market this year has emboldened the Fed to take aggressive action to fight inflation. Speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week, central bank Chair Jerome H. Powell said the Fed will not stop raising rates until inflation is more under control, though he expects that will probably soften the labor market and cause “some pain” for households and businesses.

Booming jobs creation also has meant fierce competition between employers for a limited labor supply. There continue to be roughly two open jobs for every job seeker, according to the July job openings report, and workers continued to quit their jobs at an elevated rate in July, in a phenomenon dubbed the “Great Resignation.”

Craig Woodling, 39, quit his job delivering packages for an Amazon contractor in Orlando last month. His co-workers had been quitting “left and right,” he said, and his manager was disappointed when he gave his notice.

“It was mostly heat and the expectations of how much Amazon wanted us to deliver,” Woodling said. He added that the number of packages he was delivering had surged to 400 a day during the pandemic, up from 220. “I’m about 40, at this point, so it’s wearing my body out.”

Woodling said he felt comfortable quitting his $18-an-hour delivery job because of a labor market with plentiful opportunities. Plus, his wife has a stable income. Now that he’s applying for jobs, he’s less certain that he’ll be able to quickly find another, particularly in the areas that he is looking: radio, his passion, or information technology.

“I thought it would be much easier to get a job once I quit, but that hasn’t been the case,” Woodling said. “Part of me wants to look for delivery jobs that I did before, but my wife keeps reminding me that you don’t want to get in that field again.”"

Nov 27 2020,"America Failed at COVID-19, but the Economy’s Okay. Why?",The Atlantic,left,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/america-failed-covid-economys-ok-why/617223/,"Here is a remarkable, underappreciated fact: The U.S. economy has performed far better than that of many of the country’s peers during this horrible year. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. economy to contract by 4.4 percent in 2020, versus 5.3 percent in Japan, 6 percent in Germany, 7.1 percent in Canada, and nearly 10 percent in both the United Kingdom and France.

This fact is not a result of the United States managing its public-health response better than those countries, allowing it to reopen from lockdown sooner and for consumption to roar back. Indeed, many of those peer nations have had significantly better outcomes, as measured by COVID-19 caseloads, hospitalizations, and death rates. Nor is it a result of the U.S. preserving more jobs. The unemployment rate is far higher here than it is in Japan, Germany, or the U.K.

America owes its macroeconomic good fortune to Washington muscling through a giant and successful stimulus in the spring—a policy victory that Congress and the outgoing Trump administration are doing their best to cram into the jaws of defeat.

Annie Lowrey: Why the Trump administration doesn’t want to help

The United States came into the coronavirus recession with a few structural advantages, including a highly diversified economy. Countries dependent on a single hard-hit industry—Spain on tourism, for instance—have tended to falter regardless of their health or macroeconomic response. The U.S. is also lucky not to have to rely on exports for growth. World Bank data show that sales abroad account for 12 percent of our gross domestic product, compared with 18 percent in Japan, 32 percent in Canada, and 47 percent in Germany. This means that the collapse in global trade during the pandemic has hit other countries far harder than the U.S.

Another structural advantage is that Washington prints the world’s reserve currency, which means that it tends to suck in global capital flows when uncertainty is high, “as in a pandemic,” Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics told me. That pushes up American asset values and lowers American borrowing costs. The U.S. labor market is also more flexible than those in other countries, Zandi noted. “Americans are more willing to adopt new technologies, to move for a job, and [to] make big changes in how they live and work.” That makes absorbing big, strange shocks easier.

The United States has been better not just in form but also in function, with regard to combatting the economic fallout of the pandemic. It has had best-of-class monetary policy: This spring, the Federal Reserve, the country’s most capable technocratic institution, calmed the financial markets with an alphabet soup of special programs while dropping interest rates to zero and flooding the markets with cash.

Yet Washington, improbably, has truly distinguished itself with fiscal policy, at least earlier in the year. The U.S. has fewer, stingier, more complicated, and more conditional safety nets available to people than many other advanced economies—less generous “automatic stabilizers,” in economic parlance. But when COVID-19 hit, congressional Democrats negotiated a series of enormous, highly effective temporary stabilizers with Republicans who were ready to go big, among them Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, Congress provided forgivable loans to small businesses; sent $1,200 checks to most Americans; added gig workers to the unemployment-insurance system; and put a $600 weekly top-up on unemployment checks.

“We’d never seen such a rapid and massive amount of stimulus being doled out by Congress, ever,” Gregory Daco, an economist at the international forecasting firm Oxford Economics, told me. “Contrast it with what happened in the global financial crisis” that precipitated the Great Recession in 2007. “It took three times longer to get a stimulus package half the size.” Indeed, the U.S. provided fiscal support equivalent to roughly 12 percent of its GDP, data from Moody’s Analytics show, one-third more than Germany and twice as much as the U.K. Other than Australia, no large, wealthy country did more to support its economy.

The investment paid off. The U.S. increased millions of low-income families’ earnings over the spring and summer, and increased the amount of money in American pockets overall. This meant that while the economy experienced a sharp, miserable contraction, as businesses closed down, trade halted, and fear took over, it has bounced back better than many of its peers. The U.K., Germany, Canada, and France are all doing worse—in some cases far worse—in terms of output.

Annie Lowrey: The pandemic proved that cash payments worked

Still, the U.S. is not exactly the North Star leading the world out of the death, destruction, and devastation of 2020. Some peer countries did better in macroeconomic terms—countries that did not bungle their public-health responses and managed to add good amounts of stimulus as necessary, too. Australia, South Korea, and Taiwan have saved lives, jobs, and output, all together.

Moreover, Washington shored up output without shoring up employment, a queasy policy legacy for the 10 million Americans who had jobs a year ago and do not today. The Paycheck Protection Program created in the CARES Act did help many small businesses keep employees on their books in the early days of the pandemic. But many small firms are ailing now; the hospitality industry has been decimated; and state and local governments are shedding workers. Other countries elected to directly subsidize employment, paying businesses to keep workers on the books, though often at lower pay.

America’s strong GDP number also masks the brutal inequality of the recession. Young workers and low-wage workers have been hit particularly hard, meaning that the people least capable of bearing any financial pain are being asked to bear the majority of it, especially since the initial federal unemployment-insurance bonus ended. The decision in many states to not open public schools for in-person instruction has also hurt parents, especially women, hundreds of thousands of whom have dropped out of the labor force to supervise their children’s online learning. “Working mothers and single mothers are having a miserable time in this recovery,” Michelle Holder, an economist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice at the City University of New York, told me. She also noted that the recession has amplified deep racial disparities, with a large share of Black and Latino workers losing jobs and many leaving the labor force entirely.

The United States’ relative GDP success might not last much longer, either. The country is facing not just a slowing recovery but also a potential reversal. Eviction moratoriums and student-loan-payment deferrals end on December 31. The Federal Reserve is in a public spat with the Treasury Department, which is trying to end and reclaim the financing for some of the Fed’s special-support programs. The financial benefits from the $1,200 in helicopter money and the additional $600 in unemployment checks are fading too. Credit-card and debit-card usage is decreasing. Restaurant reservations are down. Measures of consumer mobility, like surveys of miles driven and flights taken, are dropping. Layoffs are increasing, and unemployment-insurance claims are stuck above 1 million a week.

Derek Thompson: The workforce is about to change dramatically

The situation is made yet more dangerous by the intensification of the pandemic. “We’re in a scary exponential phase of the virus,” Daco told me. “That means higher hospitalizations, more deaths, more restrictions on activity, more fear, and therefore less consumer spending, less business investment, and a slowdown in economic activity.” Any advantages the U.S. had are dwindling. “We’re looking at a double-dip recession and deep scarring” if Congress does nothing, says Diane Swonk, the chief economist at Grant Thornton, an accounting and advisory firm.

The U.S. is still winning the global recovery, at least in GDP terms. But Congress seems uninterested in repeating its springtime success. Republicans are negotiating for an insufficient stimulus, with Democrats holding out for a bigger one that might never materialize. And not even the widespread deployment of a vaccine in 2021 will make workers whole again."

Oct 01 2021,Why October 19 could be a catastrophic day for the US economy,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/01/economy/debt-ceiling-next-steps/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

The United States could be just weeks away from defaulting on its debt for the first time ever.

The $28.4 trillion debt limit was reinstated August 1. Since then, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has been keeping the nation’s finances afloat by using emergency accounting maneuvers. Known as “extraordinary measures,” these steps allow the government to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt ceiling.

But Yellen warned lawmakers this week that if Congress fails to raise, or suspend, the debt ceiling, the federal government will exhaust those extraordinary measures by October 18.

“At that point, we expect Treasury would be left with very limited resources that would be depleted quickly,” Yellen wrote in a letter to Congress. “It is uncertain whether we would continue to meet all the nation’s commitments after that date.”

That’s an accelerated timing from previously, when Yellen said this would happen at some point in October.

This so-called X-date should be viewed as a best guess by Treasury, not a set-in-stone deadline based on exact science. In other words, America could hit the debt ceiling days before, or days after, October 18.

There are many, many moving pieces here. Yellen herself warned the X-date “can unpredictably shift forward or backward.”

And given the stakes — Jamie Dimon has warned a default would cause a “cascading catastrophe of unbelievable proportions and damage America for 100 years” — it would be risky for Congress to get too close to the X-date, let alone beyond it.

Is there any leeway? Maybe

Of course, Treasury secretaries have a long history of giving themselves wiggle room when announcing an X-date — just in case Congress blows through that date. That’s what happened in 2011: Washington didn’t default then, but the delay did cost America its perfect credit rating from S&P and rattle financial markets.

It’s the same idea as telling someone who is chronically late that dinner is two hours earlier than scheduled – just to make sure they’re on time.

There is some debate over just how much wiggle room Yellen is giving Congress this time.

Yellen was asked at a hearing on Thursday “what happens on October 19” and her response indicates there could be a bit of leeway, but not much.

“We’re simply in an impossible situation in which it will be impossible for Treasury on that day, or a few days thereafter…We’ll have very limited resources,” Yellen said. “It will be run down quickly. We won’t be able to pay all of the government’s bills.”

However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a report Tuesday that suggests there may be additional time beyond October 18 for lawmakers to avoid a catastrophic default.

The CBO projects that if the debt limit remains unchanged, Treasury’s ability to borrow using extraordinary measures will be exhausted and it will “most likely run out of cash near the end of October or the beginning of November.” That’s unchanged from CBO’s prior estimate in July.

CBO warns that after that happens, the federal government would be “unable to pay its obligations fully, and it would delay making payments for some activities, default on its debt obligations, or both.”

However, others think there is much less time.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told CNN on Wednesday that Yellen is “likely being somewhat conservative,” but not overly so.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it is a day or two later than the 18th,” Zandi said. “I’m estimating the 20th.”

That implies a bit of wiggle room, but not much, certainly not as much as in 2011. Zandi said Thursday he’s not changing his estimate — despite the more optimistic take by the CBO.

Very hard to predict

The problem is that nailing down a precise X-date is unusually difficult today because there are even more moving pieces than during prior debt ceiling clashes.

Beyond the usual outlays for items like Social Security, Medicare and defense contracts, the Treasury is making big payments for disaster relief and Covid programs.

At the same time, tax revenue has been more volatile due to the impact of the pandemic.

“Usually, these things aren’t very hard to predict. But right now, they are,” said Thomas Simons, senior money market economist at Jefferies. “The variant in daily cash flows is so high relative to historical precedent.”

Yellen noted the government’s daily gross cash flow averaged nearly $50 billion per day over the past year and has even exceeded $300 billion.

‘Scarily close to running out of cash’

Like Yellen, some on Wall Street are moving up the timing of when the government could default.

As recently as September 10, Jefferies projected that Treasury could avoid default until November 10-15, based on projections for cash balances and updated data on extraordinary measures.

“Since then, things have changed,” Simons wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

In particular, Simons noted that Treasury’s cash position “has dwindled faster than we expected it would throughout September.”

That’s never a good sign heading into a debt ceiling impasse.

Simons said Treasury’s cash balances are starting to get “very low” on October 18. “We are more or less in agreement with Yellen,” Simons wrote in a report titled “Yellen flags October 18…and we think she means it this time.”

Asked on Thursday about the CBO report, Simons conceded there is a great deal of uncertainty and said the CBO forecast gives him a bit more hope — but not much.

“I still think that during the middle of October, Treasury is going to get scarily close to running out of cash,” Simons told CNN. “I am still extremely concerned about what is going to happen in the middle of next month.”"

Jan 06 2023,"Labor Market Defies Fed as Unemployment Falls to 3.5% and Economy Adds 223,000 Jobs",Breitbart News,right,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2023/01/06/labor-market-tightens-as-u-s-added-223000-jobs-in-december-unemployment-fell-to-3-5/,"The U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate plunged to 3.5 percent, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists had expected the economy to add 200,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to remain unchanged at 3.7 percent. The range of forecasts by economists surveyed by Econoday was between a gain on payrolls of 150,000 to 230,000. On unemployment, the range of forecasts was 3.7 percent to 3.8 percent.

The Labor Department’s Job Opening and Labor Turnover Survey, knowns as Jolts, showed that there were 10.5 million job openings at the end of November and October, around 1.7 vacancies for every unemployed person. Federal Reserve officials frequently cite the vacancy ratio as evidence that the labor market is so tight that it risks fueling inflation.

Fed officials have said that softening demand for labor is the key to bringing inflation down to their two percent target. They fear that high demand for labor is fueling wage increases that, in turn, drive prices of goods and services up.

Despite the strong gains in employment, average hourly earnings rose by less than expected. The Department of Labor said average hourly earnings rose 9 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $32.82. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have increased by 4.6 percent. Economists had expected a 0.4 percent gain for the month and a five percent gain compared with a year ago. The prior month’s wage gain was revised down to 0.4 percent month-to-month from 0.6 percent and 4.8 percent annually from 5.1 percent."
Jan 06 2023,"US job growth cools slightly in December as economy adds 223,000 new positions",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-job-growth-cools-slightly-december-economy-adds-new-positions,"U.S. hiring cooled in December to the lowest pace in two years, but the labor market remained resilient in the face of higher interest rates, scorching-hot inflation and mounting recession fears.

Employers added 223,000 jobs in December, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, topping the 200,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. Still, it marks a slight deceleration from the downwardly revised gain of 256,000 in November and is the worst month for job creation since December 2020. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.5%, a five-decade low.

""No doubt the labor market has been able to withstand prolonged rate hikes better than many expected,"" said Mike Loewengart, head of model portfolio construction at Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office. ""Remember though that monetary policy acts on a lag, so it’s likely an if and not a when for a slowdown in hiring. The Fed minutes made it clear that rates will remain high for all of 2023, so investors should prepare for a bumpy ride.""

Wage growth also cooled in December, with average hourly earnings rising just 0.3% from a month earlier and 4.6% from the previous year. That is likely a reassuring sign for the Federal Reserve as it tries to wrestle stubbornly high inflation under control with the most aggressive rate-hike campaign since the 1980s. Policymakers see wages as a pivotal indicator of inflationary pressures in the economy.

US FACES INCREASED STAGFLATION THREAT IN 2023 AFTER WAVE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING

Stocks rose following the better-than-expected report as the wage data boosted investor hopes that the Fed will soon pause its rate hikes.

Job gains were broad-based in December, with leisure and hospitality leading the way in hiring, adding 67,000 new workers. That was followed by health care (54,700), construction (28,000) and social assistance (19,700).

However, some sectors saw payrolls shrink last month: Employment services shed 39,700 workers, and advertising and related services lost 4,200.

While monthly jobs data is always important, the Fed has been closely watching the report for signs the labor market is starting to slow down from its frenzied pace as policymakers try to wrestle inflation, which is still about three times higher than its pre-pandemic average, back to 2%.

""The December jobs report was stronger than expected, with solid job growth and the unemployment rate falling back to a half-century low,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""The Fed will see this jobs report as a green light for further rate hikes in early 2023.""

Fed officials already approved seven straight increases in 2022, including four back-to-back 75-basis-point hikes, raising the federal funds rate to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007. Policymakers have said they intend to leave rates elevated for ""some time"" to avoid a potential inflation resurgence.

DEMOCRATS SLAM 'DANGEROUS' FED RATE HIKES, WARNING OF WIDESPREAD JOB LOSSES

Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

There have already been a series of notable layoffs over the past few months: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft and Twitter are among the companies either implementing hiring freezes or letting workers go. That could soon bleed into the broader labor market; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear that policymakers anticipate job growth will slow and unemployment could climb as they raise interest rates higher, but he has argued that an alternative where prices soar unchecked is worse.

Aug 24 2020,Why Trump’s Approval Ratings on the Economy Remain Durable,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/us/politics/trump-economy.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage,"It is an enduring political question amid a pandemic recession, double-digit unemployment and a recovery that appears to be slowing: Why does President Trump continue to get higher marks on economic issues in polls than his predecessors Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush enjoyed when they stood for re-election?

Mr. Trump’s relative strength on the economy, and whether Joseph R. Biden Jr. can cut into it over the next 10 weeks, are among the crucial dynamics in battleground states in the Midwest and the Sun Belt that are expected to decide the election. Many of these states have struggled this summer with rising coronavirus infection and death rates as well as job losses and vanishing wages and savings — hard times that, history suggests, will pose a threat to an incumbent president seeking re-election.

Yet polling data and interviews with voters and political analysts suggest that a confluence of factors is raising Mr. Trump’s standing on the economy issue, which remains a centerpiece of his pitch for a second term and is expected to be a major theme of the Republican National Convention this week.

The president has built an enduring brand with conservative voters, in particular, who continue to see him as a successful businessman and tough negotiator. Many of those voters praise his economic stewardship before the pandemic hit, and they do not blame him for the damage it has caused. In interviews, some of those voters cited record stock market gains — although only about half of Americans own any stock at all — as evidence of a rebound under the president."
Apr 05 2022,The U.S. Economy Is Booming. So Why Are Economists Worrying About a Recession?,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/business/economy/recession-economy.html,"Employers are adding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, and would hire even more people if they could find them. Consumers are spending, businesses are investing, and wages are rising at their fastest pace in decades.

So naturally, economists are warning of a possible recession.

Rapid inflation, soaring oil prices and global instability have led forecasters to sharply lower their estimates of economic growth this year, and to raise their probabilities of an outright contraction. Investors share that concern: The bond market last week flashed a warning signal that has often — though not always — foreshadowed a downturn.

Such predictions may seem confusing when the economy, by many measures, is booming. The United States has regained more than 90 percent of the jobs lost in the early weeks of the pandemic, and employers are continuing to hire at a breakneck pace, adding 431,000 jobs in March alone. The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent, barely above the prepandemic level, which was itself a half-century low.

But to the doomsayers, the recovery’s remarkable strength carries the seeds of its own destruction. Demand — for cars, for homes, for restaurant meals and for the workers to provide them — has outstripped supply, leading to the fastest inflation in 40 years. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve argue they can cool off the economy and bring down inflation without driving up unemployment and causing a recession. But many economists are skeptical that the Fed can engineer such a “soft landing,” especially in a moment of such extreme global uncertainty."
Aug 05 2022,"US economy adds 528,000 jobs in July, blowing past expectations",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-economy-adds-528000-jobs-july-blowing-past-expectations,"U.S. job growth unexpectedly accelerated in July, defying fears of a slowdown in hiring even as the labor market confronts the twin threats of scorching-hot inflation and rising interest rates.

Employers added 528,000 jobs in July, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, blowing past the 250,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, edged down to 3.5%, the lowest level since the COVID-19 pandemic began more than two years ago.

The U.S. has now replaced all the jobs that were lost during the pandemic.

Job gains were broad-based in July, with leisure and hospitality leading the way in hiring, adding 96,000 new workers. That was followed by professional businesses services (89,000), health care (70,000) and government (57,000). Construction contributed 32,000 new jobs while manufacturing added 30,000.

HOW DEMOCRATS' BEEFED-UP IRS COULD HURT LOW-INCOME AMERICANS

The uptick in hiring comes amid a growing consensus that the economy is losing momentum as the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates at the fastest pace in decades to wrestle inflation under control. The Commerce Department reported last week that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the nation, shrank 0.6% in the three-month period from April to June. That followed a decline of 1.6% in the first three months of the year.

With back-to-back quarterly declines in GDP, the economy meets the technical criteria for a recession.

While many economists have argued the strong jobs market has so far prevented the U.S. from sliding into a downturn, job growth momentum is expected to cool markedly in coming months as companies cut staff in order to accommodate for lower demand.

Jobless claims have started to steadily tick higher in recent weeks and a plethora of companies, including Alphabet's Google, Walmart, Apple, Meta, Robinhood and Microsoft, have announced hiring freezes or layoffs in recent weeks.

""A powerful increase in July employment—at 528,000, the largest since last December—underscored bedrock support from the labor market, putting the economy on a more gradual trajectory for a recession,"" said Gary Schlossberg, a global strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.

DEMOCRATS' MINIMUM CORPORATE TAX WOULD HIT THESE INDUSTRIES THE HARDEST

The incredibly tight labor market is in part fueling record-high inflation, as millions of workers are seeing the largest pay gains in years – the result of companies competing with one another for a limited number of employees. Earnings rose 5.2% in July from the previous year, much higher than the pre-pandemic average of 3%. On a monthly basis, wages rose 0.5%, coming in hotter than economists expected.

The surprisingly strong July jobs report, coupled with hotter-than-expected wage growth, could pave the way to a third consecutive 75-basis point increase – triple the usual size – at the Fed's next policy-setting meeting in September. Traders are already pricing in a 64% chance of another super-sized increase in the fall.

That could create even more burdens for businesses because hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

The jump in payroll growth ""is not quite what the Fed was hoping to see, particularly the acceleration of average hourly earnings to a 0.5% month-over-month growth pace,"" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. ""All else equal, this should take away any excuse from the Fed to begin slowing down its tightening pace, as there are still few concrete signs of inflation returning to normal.""

Oct 27 2017,Economy posts impressive growth despite hurricanes,CNN (Online News),left,http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/27/news/economy/us-economy-gdp-third-quarter/index.html,"Even hurricanes weren't enough to stop impressive growth in the economy.

The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate from July through September, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Economists were expecting 2.5% at best, partly because of the damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.

Growth in the third quarter ""demonstrates that the hurricane ended up having little lasting impact on the economy,"" says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a research firm.

In fact, the United States enjoyed back-to-back quarters of 3% growth for the first time in three years. Growth from April through June was 3.1%.

President Trump has promised to get it to 3% for an entire year. Economic growth has hung around 2% for years, partly because of slow wage growth and weak spending by businesses.

Related: The job market is strong. Here's the asterisk.

The economy has grown for eight straight years, one of the longest stretches in history. Unemployment is down to 4.2%, its lowest since 2001. The United States has added jobs in 83 of the past 84 months.

""It's still the slowest recovery by a long way,"" says Dan North, chief economist at Euler Hermes North America, an insurance firm. ""But we don't see anything to suggest that we would get a recession in the next year.""

North and other economists expected a bigger toll from the hurricanes. Ports, schools and businesses were temporarily closed, and some employees couldn't get to work even if their businesses stayed open.

Hurricane recovery efforts are expected to provide a boost to economic growth toward the end of the year.

Nearly all corners of the U.S. economy contributed to growth in the third quarter. Exports, imports and business spending on long-term projects were all up. Consumer spending, which makes up the majority of economic activity, rose a healthy 3.3%.

North expects the U.S. economy to stay on track unless an unexpected shock happens, ""like an incident with North Korea."""
Mar 21 2022,"Could permanent daylight saving time help ""jump-start"" the economy?",CBS News (Online),left,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/daylight-saving-time-permanent-economy/,"Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are getting behind a bill that would impact every resident in the U.S.: A permanent switch to daylight saving time beginning in November 2023. Aside from avoiding the nuisance — and sleep deprivation — of changing clocks twice a year, the effort could give the economy a boost, lawmakers say.

The Sunshine Protection Act should boost consumer spending and shift energy consumption by giving Americans an extra hour of sunlight at the end of the workday, the lawmakers said in a release about the bill. Passage of the bill could ""jump-start"" the economy and effectively act as a ""stimulus package all on its own,"" wrote Sam Lyman, policy director of the Orrin G. Hatch Foundation, in an op-ed in The Hill.

But the economic benefits of year-round DST may be murkier than its supporters suggest, according to PNC economist Kurt Rankin, who looked into studies about time shifts and their impact on the economy. First off, there's not much available research on the issue, at least when compared with other aspects of the economy such as wages or inflation. And the existing research is limited in scope, raising questions about what the national economic impact would be.

""From an economist perspective, I think the benefits will be minimal,"" Rankin told CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's not something that is going to cure the woes that are facing the U.S. economy over the next year or two — the inflation concerns, rising interest rates, the supply chain shortages.""

One finding often cited as evidence of the economic benefits of the switch comes from the JP Morgan Chase Institute, which in 2016 found that consumer spending dropped 3.5% after the end of daylight saving time in November. That suggests some consumers pare their spending when there's one less hour of daylight at the end of the day for them to shop or do errands.

But the Chase Institute study focused on spending in Los Angeles, a relatively limited scope. And the researchers noted that other policy changes, such as a sales tax holiday, could provide a larger boost to consumer spending.

A boost for restaurants?

Some business groups say they are studying the issue. The National Retail Federation in an email said it has ""historically supported daylight saving time, but that position does not reflect the current debate over creating permanent daylight saving time, which was passed by the Senate this week.""

It added, ""We are examining the implications of this change and consulting with our members.""

That being said, Rankin believed the switch to permanent DST could benefit one sector of the economy: Hospitality businesses like restaurants and hotels. More daylight toward the end of the day could boost demand for those services, which would help those businesses as well as gig economy workers like DoorDash drivers.

""That is the sector that is still having the most difficulty bouncing back from the pandemic, so giving some security to workers in that sector will be helpful,"" he said.

Rankin added that he himself likes the idea of a permanent switch, even if he doesn't see much of an economic case for the bill. ""I'm in favor of getting rid of changing the clocks because it throws off your schedule,"" he said days after clocks were spun forward one hour on March 13. ""I've been eating dinner an hour and a half late the last week, as I try to adjust.""

Energy savings argument is ""questionable""

The research findings on energy savings — one of the primary reasons supporters suggest making daylight saving time permanent — is mixed. A 2008 Department of Energy study found that there was a savings of 0.5% in electricity per day in the four weeks after the nation extended daylight saving time in 2005.

Do people cheering on this permanent move to Daylight Saving Time not wake up before 7am ever? — Anna Kramer (@akiltykramer) March 16, 2022

Yale University researchers in a 2011 paper found that daylight saving time actually increased energy consumption in Indiana because higher heating and cooling costs outpaced lower demand for electrical lighting. The researchers wrote, ""We find that the long-standing rationale for DST is questionable.""

But that paper is based on energy consumption in one state — once again, a small section of the U.S. — and might not be applicable more broadly.

Unanimous approval in Senate

The bill, which was approved unanimously by the Senate on Tuesday, must now be approved by the House and signed by the president to become law.

At a House Energy Subcommittee on Consumer Protection hearing on March 9, experts urged lawmakers to make the change, citing issues such as safety and an increase in traffic accidents when commuters are traveling during darkness.

""Simply put, darkness kills. And darkness in the evening is far deadlier than darkness in the morning,"" University of Washington professor Steve Calandrillo said. https://t.co/VnTO2w8LJA — CBS News (@CBSNews) March 15, 2022

""Simply put, darkness kills. And darkness in the evening is far deadlier than darkness in the morning,"" University of Washington professor Steve P. Calandrillo told the committee.

Americans themselves are divided on the issue, according to polls. About 3 in 10 people said they would like to have daylight saving time all year round, while an equal number said they'd prefer to keep the current system of falling back an hour in November and springing forward an hour in March, an AP-NORC poll found in 2019. The remaining 4 in 10 people said they wanted to switch to standard time all year.

In the end, the rationale for switching to permanent daylight savings time may come down to personal preference, not economics. As JPMorgan Chase put it: Americans ""may simply enjoy having the additional daylight."""

What’s happening

The coronavirus pandemic is, first and foremost, a health crisis, but it has also had a profound economic impact. The unemployment rate in the U.S. was 3.5 percent in February. By April, amid a nationwide shutdown to stem the spread of the virus, it had risen to 14.7 percent, the highest rate since the Great Depression. Before the outbreak, the U.S. economy had been enjoying the longest period of growth in history.

The current recession is different from other recent downturns, like the 2008 financial collapse, which saw a more gradual decline caused by instability within the economy itself. The virus, however, caused the economy to collapse almost overnight. Some economic indicators rebounded strongly as lockdowns were lifted in parts of the country, raising hopes of a V-shaped recovery in which things return to normal as rapidly as they had declined. President Trump called the economy “a rocket ship” after the release of promising unemployment numbers in early June.

Despite those gains, there are signs that the recovery is stalling as the number of COVID-19 cases spike in several parts of the country. It’s too soon to know the full economic impact of major outbreaks that have hit states like Arizona, Florida and California. But some economists have expressed concern that the economy may be on the brink of a true collapse.

Why there’s debate

Though the recent resurgence in the virus may make a V-shaped recovery unlikely, there are still reasons for optimism. Though key economic indicators like unemployment and consumer spending suggest a dire scenario, the actual impact of the downturn on Americans may be less extreme than those numbers may indicate.

A $2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress in March — which included $1,200 direct payments, boosted unemployment payments by $600 a week and hundreds of billions of dollars in loans for businesses — has been credited with preventing the worst-case scenario for the economy over the past few months. Bans on evictions at the federal and state level, along with mortgage relief, have helped struggling families remain in their homes. The stock market has regained most of the losses it suffered at the onset of the pandemic.

These hopeful signs may be hiding the true state of an economy on the brink of another major crash that sends the country into a depression, some economists fear. One of the major reasons for concern is the end of many measures that have kept the nation afloat. Enhanced unemployment is set to expire at the end of July, and the loans may not be enough for businesses to keep their doors open. Eviction moratoriums are also due to end soon. State budgets have cratered because of lost tax revenue.

It’s unclear whether Congress would be willing to spend more money to keep these programs running and bail out states. A worst-case scenario envisioned by economists could see federal assistance drying up at the same time businesses begin to shut down en mass, state government jobs disappear and millions of Americans lose their homes. The combined result of all these crises hitting at once could even spark another financial collapse like the one that caused the Great Recession, experts fear.

What’s next

Democrats in the House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion stimulus bill in May that would, among other things, extend enhanced unemployment and provide another round of stimulus checks. The Republicans in the Senate and the Trump administration appear to be eyeing a smaller package that totals less than $1 trillion. A final stimulus bill is expected by the end of the month, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said.

Perspectives

The economy is on the brink of collapse

“The U.S. economy right now is like a jumbo jet that’s in a steady glide after both its engines flamed out. … It will likely crash into the side of a mountain.” — Tom Gara, BuzzFeed

The current crisis is so unique, all forecasts are essentially guesses

“There are lots of economists, analysts and experts pontificating on the future of the U.S. economy. Don’t believe any of them. No one really knows.” — Gene Marks, The Guardian

Congress can prevent a worst-case scenario if it’s willing to spend enough

“If Washington won’t provide more support to working-class families now, there won’t be enough consumer spending to keep struggling Main Street businesses alive much longer. And if those businesses fail, other dominoes will fall.” — Rex Nutting, Marketwatch

A housing crisis may be coming soon

“Like every other aspect of the lockdown crisis, the coming avalanche of housing-related debt has been entirely predictable. With real estate prices grotesquely inflated and wages that were already stagnant either falling or non-existent, something like this was bound to happen sooner or later.” — Matthew Walther, The Week

The fate of the economy is directly tied to the state of the pandemic

“Financial aid, while vitally important for reducing the economic pain caused by Covid-19, will not hasten the end of the pandemic. The only way to end our financial crisis and restore the economy is to address the pandemic itself.” — Steven Berry and Zach Cooper, Politico

Short-term stimulus has hidden truly dire state of the economy

“America’s economic crisis is worse than it looks. For that reason, it’s about to get worse than it is.” — Eric Levitz, New York

Another financial collapse is possible

“Imagine if, in addition to all the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, you woke up one morning to find that the financial sector had collapsed. You may think that such a crisis is unlikely, with memories of the 2008 crash still so fresh. But banks learned few lessons from that calamity, and new laws intended to keep them from taking on too much risk have failed to do so. As a result, we could be on the precipice of another crash.” — Frank Partnoy, The Atlantic

Keeping businesses alive through the current virus surge is necessary to prevent disaster

“The thing that stands between the present severe, sharp recession, and a second Great Depression, is doing everything possible to ensure that when the virus is tamed (and it is a when, not an if), employers will still be around to pay their workers.” — Daniel Alpert, Business Insider

Reopening prematurely created the illusion of a recovery

“President Donald Trump pushed relentlessly to reopen, on the mistaken belief that it would fire up the economy, and devoted Republican governors quickly obliged. Reopening creates a flicker of economic activity, a fleeting illusion of recovery, followed by an explosion of disease and death, which demands further shutdowns.” — Frida Ghitis, CNN

Mass inequality made the U.S. economy more vulnerable

“No matter how you distribute income or organize industry, a deadly, highly transmissible virus is going to be bad for business. But the gross inequities of the modern U.S. economy have deepened the COVID-19 recession.” — Eric Levitz, New York

The chances of a swift recovery are gone

“If there were still hopes of a ‘V-shaped’ comeback from the novel coronavirus shutdown, this past week should have put an end to them. The pandemic shock, which economists once assumed would be only a temporary business interruption, appears instead to be settling into a traditional, self-perpetuating recession.” — David J. Lynch, Washington Post

Yet economists are divided over whether the plan is likely to revitalize the economy or merely bestow a windfall on the wealthiest investors.

Even before President Trump vowed as a candidate to sharpen America’s competitive edge, Republicans led by the House speaker, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, were arguing that large tax cuts would unleash a hurricane of economic activity.

Jul 25 2022,Lincoln Project Calls Biden’s Job on the Economy ‘Enormously Successful.’ Americans Disagree.,Washington Free Beacon,right,https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/lincoln-project-calls-bidens-job-on-the-economy-enormously-successful-americans-disagree/,"Anti-Republican super PAC the Lincoln Project congratulated President Joe Biden for creating ""one of the strongest economies in American history"" even as the nation approaches its second consecutive quarter of negative growth in gross domestic product.

Biden has had an ""enormously successful first 18 months in office,"" the Lincoln Project claimed on Monday in a rosy assessment of the president's performance that's at odds with the majority of Americans who blame Biden for record inflation.

""President Biden is a decent human being who exhibits the qualities we should cherish in a President: he’s a strong leader with clear moral standards and empathizes with Americans for the challenges they face every day,"" Lincoln Project cofounder Reed Galen said. ""President Biden shows what American greatness looks like.""

The Lincoln Project cited job growth, wage increases, and historically low unemployment as proof of Biden’s success. But nearly a million-and-a-half Americans could lose their jobs next year, according to a report last month from the Federal Reserve. Around two-thirds of Americans say Biden is either ""responsible"" or ""very responsible"" for inflation, polling shows.

Formed in 2019 to oppose former president Donald Trump, the Lincoln Project is known for spending millions of dollars to oppose Republicans such as Gov. Glenn Youngkin (Va.) while achieving little electoral success. The anti-Republican organization gained notoriety last year after it was revealed that founding member John Weaver sent suggestive messages to dozens of young men and at least one 14-year-old child.

The White House last week redefined the term ""recession,"" which is commonly understood as two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP, ahead of a Thursday GDP report that will likely reveal the economy shrunk for the second quarter in a row. The White House said a recession is determined through ""a holistic look at the data,"" leading critics to accuse the Biden administration of covering its tracks so it won’t have to call the economic crisis a recession."

Biden took aim at House Republican leaders who have suggested they might use the debt ceiling as ""leverage"" to achieve their goals on entitlements in a budget showdown under a Republican majority. The president singled out Social Security and Medicare.

""If you're worried about the economy, you need to know this,"" Biden said. ""The Republican leadership in Congress has made it clear. They will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for the first time in our history, putting the United States in default, unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security and Medicare.""

The president added: ""Let me be really clear. I will not yield.""

The economy:President Biden says 'slight recession' is possible — but not guaranteed in 2023

Biden's remarks came as he touted a $1.4 trillion decrease in the federal budget deficit this year as pandemic spending has slowed. The debt limit, the subject of several partisan fights in recent years, sets the limit the federal government can borrow to carry out spending authorized by Congress.

Biden told reporters he opposes eliminating the debit limit, calling it ""irresponsible."" His position puts him at odds with his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, who has expressed support for abolishing the debt ceiling.

Economists for months have predicted an economic slowdown, and Biden has acknowledged a ""slight recession"" is possible. Inflation hovering near a 40-year high and a souring economy have crystalized as the top issues for midterm voters, according to multiple polls, with Republican candidates receiving higher marks on the economy than Democrats.

It has put Democrats at a major midterm disadvantage, particularly as economic fears top concerns about abortion rights, which Democrats have campaigned aggressively on restoring.

Republicans have strong odds to regain control of the House and are in position to perhaps take the Senate. Although recent polling has shown Republicans gaining traction, Biden predicted ""we're going to see one more shift back to our side in the closing days.""

Biden cited ""good news on the economy,"" pointing to low unemployment and gas prices that are once again easing. However, inflation remains above 8%, proving harder to shake than the administration predicted, and the stock market remains volatile.

In contrast, Biden said Republicans want to extend former President Donald Trump's tax cuts for corporations and ""send jobs overseas"" so companies can pay workers lower wages.

""The election is not a referendum. It's a choice,"" Biden said. ""And Republicans criticize my economic record, but look at what I've inherited and what I've done, and look at what they're offering.""

Aug 05 2021,Biden seeks to boost fuel economy to thwart Trump rollback,Associated Press Fact Check,left,https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-environment-and-nature-economy-88fe6ca8e333f3d00f6d2e98c6652cea,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Declaring the U.S. must “move fast” to win the world’s carmaking future, President Joe Biden on Thursday announced a commitment from the auto industry to produce electric vehicles for as much as half of U.S. sales by the end of the decade.

Biden also wants automakers to raise gas mileage and cut tailpipe pollution between now and model year 2026. That would mark a significant step toward meeting his pledge to cut emissions and battle climate change as he pushes a history-making shift in the U.S. from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles.

He urged that the components needed to make that sweeping change — from batteries to semiconductors — be made in the United States, too, aiming for both industry and union support for the environmental effort, with the promise of new jobs and billions in federal electric vehicle investments.

Pointing to electric vehicles parked on the White House South Lawn, the president declared them a “vision of the future that is now beginning to happen.”

“The question is whether we lead or fall behind in the race for the future,” he said, “Folks, the rest of the world is moving ahead. We have to catch up.”

In obvious good spirits, the president hopped into a plug-in hybrid Jeep Wrangler Rubicon that can run solely on batteries and took a quick spin around the driveway after the ceremony.

Earlier Thursday, the administration announced there would be new mileage and anti-pollution standards from the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department, part of Biden’s goal to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030. It said the auto industry had agreed to a target that 40% to 50% of new vehicle sales be electric by 2030.

Both the regulatory standards and the automakers’ voluntary target were included in an executive order that Biden signed as a gathering of auto industry leaders and lawmakers applauded.

The standards, which must go through the regulatory process, would reverse fuel economy and anti-pollution rollbacks done under President Donald Trump. At that time, the mileage increases were reduced to 1.5% annually through model year 2026.

The new standards would cut greenhouse gas emissions and raise fuel economy by 10% over the Trump rules in car model year 2023. They would get 5% stronger in each model year through 2026, according to an EPA statement. That’s about a 25% increase over four years.

The EPA said that by 2026, the proposed standards would be the toughest greenhouse emissions rules in U.S. history.

Still, it remains to be seen how quickly consumers will be willing to embrace higher-mileage, lower-emission vehicles over less fuel-efficient SUVs, currently the industry’s top sellers. The 2030 EV targets ultimately are nonbinding, and the industry stresses that billions of dollars in electric-vehicle investments in legislation pending in Congress will be vital to meeting those goals.

Only 2.2% of new vehicle sales were fully electric vehicles through June, according to Edmunds.com estimates. That’s up from 1.4% at the same time last year.

Biden has long declared himself “a car guy,” his blue collar political persona intertwined with support for union workers and his role, as vice president, in steadying the auto industry after the economic collapse in 2008. He told General Motors CEO Mary Barra that he wanted to reserve a certain test drive.

“I have a commitment from Mary: When they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it,” Biden said. “Right, Mary? You think I’m kidding. I’m not kidding.”

Dave Cooke, senor vehicles analyst for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the new rules are close to matching the final year of standards enacted when Barack Obama was president that were rolled back by Trump.

But Cooke said he is concerned that the regulations extend the number of years automakers get double credit toward complying with the standards for every electric vehicle they sell. That allows more emissions from internal combustion vehicles, he said.

Last week, The Associated Press and other news organizations reported that the Biden administration was discussing weaker mileage requirements with automakers, but they since have been strengthened. The change came after environmental groups complained publicly that they were too weak.

Transportation is the single biggest U.S. contributor to climate change.

The deal with automakers defines electric vehicles as plug-in hybrids, fully electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.

Environmental groups welcomed the movement but also said the administration should move faster.

“Given how climate change has already turned our weather so violent, it’s clear that we need to dramatically accelerate progress,” said Simon Mui of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Scientists say human-caused global warming is increasing temperatures, raising sea levels and worsening wildfires, droughts, floods and storms globally.

Several automakers already have announced electric vehicle sales goals similar to those in the deal with the government. Last week Ford’s CEO said his company expects 40% of its global sales to be fully electric by 2030. General Motors has said it aspires to sell only electric passenger vehicles by 2035. Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, also pledged over 40% electrified vehicles by 2030.

The Trump rollback of the Obama-era standards would require the fleet of new vehicles to get a projected 29 mpg in “real world” driving by 2026. Cooke said under the Biden EPA proposal, the mileage should be similar to the 37 mpg that the Obama rules were to achieve.

General Motors, Stellantis and Ford said in a joint statement that their recent electric-vehicle commitments show they want to lead the U.S. in the transition from combustion vehicles.

They said such a “dramatic shift” from the U.S. market today can only happen with policies that include incentives for electric vehicle purchases, adequate government funding for charging stations and money to expand electric vehicle manufacturing and the parts supply chain.

The United Auto Workers union, which has voiced concerns about being too hasty with an EV transition because of the potential impact on industry jobs, did not commit to endorsing the 40% to 50% EV target. But UAW said it stands behind the president to ”support his ambition not just to grow electric vehicles but also our capacity to produce them domestically with good wages and benefits.”

Biden on Thursday repeatedly extolled the virtues of American union workers and said that the challenges of climate change could present an opportunity for “good paying union jobs.”

Under a shift from internal combustion to electric power, jobs that now involve making pistons, fuel injectors and mufflers will be supplanted by the assembly of lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and heavy-duty wiring harnesses.

Many of those components are now built overseas, including in China. Biden has made the development of a U.S. electric vehicle supply chain a key part of his plan to create more auto industry jobs.

In a bipartisan infrastructure bill awaiting Senate passage, there is $7.5 billion for grants to build charging stations, about half of what Biden originally proposed. He wanted $15 billion for 500,000 stations, plus money for tax credits and rebates to entice people into buying electric vehicles.

Colleges are producing many “graduates who’ve absorbed a worldview that trains them for “metropolitan elite” job types that turn out to be far scarcer than the graduates competing for them,” writes Mary Harrington, a young writer at Unherd.com. She continues:

The result is a frustrated would-be middle class, treading water in what the writer Venkatesh Rao has called ‘premium mediocre’ lifestyles, a rented simulacrum of a genuinely prosperous existence designed to signal preparedness for the day when, by luck or application, they make it into the dwindling numbers of the real bourgeoisie. These graduate left-behinds are then stuck in a holding pattern, in precarious housing and employment, as opportunities to take the big steps into adult life — traditionally home ownership, coupledom and kids – recede ever further into the distance. A recent Pew report showed 30% of millennials living with a spouse and child, a fall of 10% on Generation X and a whopping 40% drop on the 1968 generation. That’s America, but ONS data shows the age of first child climbing relentlessly in Britain too — while the birth rate is falling in all cohorts save the over-40s.

They are failing because the investor class is pushing them and their college peers out of good jobs to make room for an imported workforce of cheap and compliant visa workers.

This means Antifa people are now going through the same outsourcing pain and poverty that was imposed on the American working class by the elite’s imposition of mass migration and free trade deals with Mexico and China.

Antifas college graduates are being hit hard by the little-mentioned population of roughly 1.3 million visa workers.

The visa workers are imported into the U.S. for a variety of tasks. Many are imported for on-the-job training so they can export their jobs to India, where they can be paid at India’s pay levels. But many also are put into the jobs at the Fortune 500 companies that would otherwise carry many young Antifa people up into middle class prosperity.

CEOs, vice-presidents, hiring managers, and investors want to hire many visa workers because they are compliant and helpless.

They are compliant because they were already powerless in their own Indian or Chinese culture. But they are also impotent because they know they can be easily thrown out of the United States and back to India or China, with a signature from any of their managers and executives.

Their powerlessness means they cannot argue with bosses, unlike American professionals. They cannot quit for different employers, as is the norm Among American graduates. They cannot quit to invent a rival product that grabs market share from their former employers, as millions of American graduates hope to do.

Congress created this powerless and growing workforce at the request of Silicon Valley’s tech companies and the Fortune 500.

So far, President Donald Trump has done nothing to shrink this massive loss of middle-class jobs, salaries, and careers.

But the young progressives and Antifa schemers have been trained to not see how their futures are being drained. Instead of learning economics and history, they were programmed in schools and colleges to focus on identity groups, on race, and on sexism — and to never follow the money.

The flow of money is rarely mentioned on TV, in Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post, or in the pro-diversity New York Times. So Antifa’s economic frustration becomes political frustration as they chase their identity-politics delusions. NBC reported in 2017:

Daniel is a sophomore studying political science at a private Bay Area university. The 19-year-old asked to have his last name withheld so he could speak freely about his experience with the Antifa movement. He said he became involved two years ago, after becoming disillusioned with what he calls a corrupted American dream. “These false promises we’ve been told throughout our lives that we just have to follow the American dream of working hard and things will be all right. We’ll get a middle class existence with house, lawn and the picket fence,” Daniel said. “This promise, this future has never materialized, and we kind of realized that the system’s rigged against us and we need to do something about it.”

Twitter commenters echo the same theme of frustrated and angry college graduates:

A great insight that explained a lot of what I see in Toronto. Tons of graduates with Master's degrees and PhDs acting all social justicey and marching around decrying the system when the real problem is their degrees in criminology or gender studies don't get them jobs. — Greg Tolan 🏴🇷🇸 (@Greg_Tolan) June 5, 2020

The Antifa graduates collect in the inner cities as they try to climb the career ladders towards the comfortable life promised by their teachers, professors, peers, and parents. This makes it is easy for them to scheme and riot, says the anti-establishment author, Michael Lind, the author of “The New Class War: Saving Democracy from the Managerial Elite.”

In an article titled “Hub City Riot Ninjas: A young overclass gets dressed up to join the burning,” Lind says:

For the most part, the members of groups like Antifa, the latest incarnation of the violent left, have always been the pampered children of the white overclass. Twenty-somethings who are poor and working class lack the money to buy fancy black ninja outfits and the leisure to spend time plotting in advance of demonstrations. This is nothing new; as a veteran ’60s leftist told me, “Your Mom and Dad had to have a lot of money for you to take part in the Summer of Love.”

Their impact is large, in part, because they live alongside each other in the urban centers where their spending power has pushed poor minorities and workers out to distant, ungentrified districts. Lind writes:

The children of the white urban elite—some of them downwardly mobile for life, some of them just going through the underpaid intern phase of professional careers—have colonized rowhouses where workers once lived and have converted former factories and warehouses into settings for la vie bohème. …

Many of today’s big city riot ninjas will look back in the future with pride on their nights of prancing around in black leotards and spraypainting “BLM” and “Fuck Trump” on downtown buildings. A decade from now, the most successful will have well-paying jobs, many of them in the politically progressive sectors like the universities and NGOs. The unlucky ones may still be working at Starbucks—perhaps at the very stores whose plate glass windows they once spray-painted or smashed.

Californian Joel Kotkin says the middle-class is shrinking, and political power is flowing to the business elite and their allied class of cheerleaders in the media and universities:

The new class structure resembles that of Medieval times. At the apex of the new order are two classes—a reborn clerical elite, the clerisy, which dominates the upper part of the professional ranks, universities, media and culture, and a new aristocracy led by tech oligarchs with unprecedented wealth and growing control of information … Below these two classes lies … the yeomanry, which is made up largely of [middle-class] small businesspeople, minor property owners, skilled workers and private-sector oriented professionals. Ascendant for much of modern history, this [yeomanry] class is in decline while those below them, the new Serfs, grow in numbers—a vast, expanding property-less population.

In this vision, Antifa consists of people who want to get into the “clerisy.” But many of them will fail and fall down into the serf class, where they tend bars, deliver food, do piecework journalism.

But these descriptions also mean that Antifa’s graduates and Trump’s working-class MAGA are potential allies.

The underemployed Antifa college graduates are close cousins to the millions of working-class Americans who rallied to Donald Trump’s 2016 message of national solidarity, and “Buy American, Hire American.” As Harrington writes in Unherd.com:

Both radical Left and Right are, the authors suggest, “different segments of the same pool of losers of globalization”. The left-behind bottom rungs of the new graduate precariat mix cosmopolitan style identity politics with a simmering anger at a system that feels rigged against them, and a demand for economic redistribution …. Meanwhile, adherents of the alt-right face similarly left-behind economic prospects, just without the graduate worldview. So the main mode is the same anger at a rigged system, just overlaid with the mirror-image of the cosmopolitan worldview: nativist identity politics.

Trump’s conventional, non-racial demand for national solidarity — Make America Great! — was the unspoken assumption of all presidential campaigns since the Great Depression in 1929. But now this call for national solidarity is smeared as “racist,” “xenophobic,” and “nativist” by the clerisy as they trumpet the Tech Elite’s demand for global business rules and a global labor market.

The clerisy has done its work well: Antifa’s college graduates have been trained to love the imposed diversity and identity politics that make them helpless to stop the outsourcing of their jobs and futures.

As Harrington writes:

From the point of view of effecting political change, then, the tragedy of the [Antifa and MAGA groups] is that they should waste their energy quarrelling among themselves. [They] represent different subsets of an ever-swelling precariat, watching in real time as the last of the twentieth century social contract goes up in smoke. Right now they largely see the enemy as one another. Should that change, though, we could see our faltering political settlement shaken to its core.

The poll shows that 49 percent of likely voters said they planned to vote for a Republican to represent them in Congress on Nov. 8, compared with 45 percent who planned to vote for a Democrat. The result represents an improvement for Republicans since September, when Democrats held a one-point edge among likely voters in the last Times/Siena poll. (The October poll’s unrounded margin is closer to three points, not the four points that the rounded figures imply.)

With inflation unrelenting and the stock market steadily on the decline, the share of likely voters who said economic concerns were the most important issues facing America has leaped since July, to 44 percent from 36 percent — far higher than any other issue. And voters most concerned with the economy favored Republicans overwhelmingly, by more than a two-to-one margin."

Jun 29 2021,Seven Reasons to Be Extremely Optimistic About the Economy Right Now,Slate,left,https://slate.com/business/2021/06/economy-optimism-inflation-wages-hiring-jobs.html,"The U.S. economy is in the middle of an awkward transition. Like a groggy bear roused from hibernation, the country is no longer dormant due to the pandemic but isn’t quite back in full form either. Millions remain unemployed, businesses are having trouble hiring, workers are still avoiding the office, and shortages of everything from lumber to computer chips have helped push up consumer prices. Economists are barking at one another about whether inflation could get out of control and Republican governors are booting their residents off of unemployment benefits to make them look for work. Some have wondered if the Biden administration spent too much money, too soon in its relief effort, setting us up for a hard landing down the line.

Advertisement

But if you look past the near-term wobbliness and pay close attention to the data that have been trickling in lately, there are ample reasons to be optimistic about where the economy is headed. It’s reasonable to think that by this year’s holidays, the long-predicted Biden boom will really be roaring, and the economic pain of the coronavirus crisis will finally be behind us. Here are seven reasons why.

﻿Reason 1: Much of the Country Is Getting COVID Under Control

You can’t talk about the economy without talking about the pandemic, and there’s mixed news on that front.

Let’s get the bad out of the way first. Vaccination rates have seemingly started to plateau and are extremely uneven across the country, ranging from 85 percent for adults in Vermont to 46 percent in Mississippi. Experts warn that the more transmissible delta variant could cause severe regional outbreaks in parts of the country where relatively few adults have gotten their shots—which is to say, much of Republican America. The nation’s seven-day average case count has already started to edge up, and is rising in most states.

Advertisement

So what’s to celebrate? Even with the virus’s recent uptick, the country is still averaging close to its lowest number of daily cases since March 2020. Cases are down or flat in 21 states and the District of Columbia, while deaths and hospitalizations are both still trending down nationally. Three states—Massachusetts, Maryland, and Vermont—are now seeing fewer than one new infection per 100,000 residents each day, putting them on track to contain the virus and halt community spread, and several others are getting close to that threshold. And because vaccination rates are much higher among the elderly, who are generally most at risk from COVID, future outbreaks should be far less deadly than in the past (which is good, because it frankly seems unlikely any states are ever going back into a lockdown). America’s prognosis isn’t improving across the board. But in much of the country, especially heavily vaccinated blue states, the pandemic is finally coming under control even as normal life resumes.

Reason 2: The Worst of Inflation Might Already Be Behind Us

For months now, inflation has been the most talked about economic boogeyman in America. Consumer prices are rising fairly quickly at the moment, and there’s been a raging argument about whether they are poised to spiral out of control (as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has loudly warned) or are merely experiencing a temporary, post-pandemic bump as industries work through product shortages caused by snags in their supply chains (which is more or less Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s position).

But while the debate about it might burn on for a while, it’s possible that inflation is already starting to cool off, as Paul Krugman recently argued at the New York Times. Much of its recent spike was driven by surging prices in just a handful of industries such as used cars that appear to have peaked. The cost of crucial commodities such as lumber has come back to earth. And on a month-to-month basis, inflation rose more slowly in May than April.

Investors also seem to be relaxing a bit, as market measures of anticipated inflation have generally fallen since May. (One notable exception is the Cleveland Fed’s expectations tracker, though it still remains near all-time lows). That’s dealt a crucial blow to the argument hawks like Summers have, which hinges on the idea that business owners could start to expect higher inflation in the future and hike their own prices accordingly, setting off a vicious, self-fulfilling cycle. Instead, the markets haven’t lost sleep over the monster that’s supposedly waiting in their closet.

Reason 3: Consumer Spending Is Up—and Should Stay Up

The United States is still down about 7.6 million jobs, but you’d never guess it from the amount of shopping people are doing these days. Despite a small dip from April, consumer spending was higher last month than in February 2020, and had nearly caught up to its pre-pandemic trend. Americans are snapping up cars, washing machines, and couches like mad.

Advertisement

The big question is whether we can keep it up. Many Americans have been relying on government aid to support themselves through the pandemic, and it’s unclear what will happen as families exhaust the money left over from their stimulus checks and federal unemployment programs expire. Will households be able to keep spending like they are now, or will they suddenly cut back? We don’t know for sure.

Advertisement

But there are good reasons to be upbeat about the answer. For starters, households saved record amounts of money while they were stuck at home in 2020, which suggests they still have pent-up spending power. Second, Americans have mostly recovered their collective earning power. Total wages and salaries quietly reached a new peak in May, and are trailing less than 1 percent behind their pre-plague trend. Pay has bounced back faster than employment, because the country’s missing jobs are largely concentrated in lower-wage service industries like hospitality.

We should still be concerned about what will happen to families who are relying on jobless benefits to get by when that aide disappears. But from a 10,000-foot perspective, the combination of savings and rising aggregate pay bodes well for consumer spending and the macroeconomy going forward.

Reason 4: There Are a Ton of Job Openings

There are more positions available than ever in America, and business owners couldn’t be saltier about it. They’re allegedly desperate to hire but claim it’s impossible to find workers because people are choosing to stay home on unemployment benefits rather than answer a help-wanted ad.

Advertisement

Advertisement

Is there any truth to that? Maybe? Probably at least a little? I mean, nobody really knows. Again, Republican-led states have already started booting residents off benefits, but it’s not clear that’s making those people hunt for work any faster (the New York Times and Wall Street Journal news sections, which both do great econ coverage, just ran dueling articles making completely opposite arguments about the situation, which should give you a sense of what a Rorschach test it is).

But here’s the thing: When you set aside the cacophony of complaints from America’s fast-food franchisees and think about the long-term, you kind of have to bask in the surplus of job openings. That’s a great problem to have. First, the competition from employers is giving workers an edge and helping push up wages in some industries. Second, it means that when the boosted federal unemployment benefits officially expire in September, people will probably be able to find employment. It should be easier and safer for people to return to work by then too, since schools will be reopening, and more states with high vaccination rates will likely have contained the virus. Hiring is a little slow right now, but regardless of why, it very well could speed up by autumn.

Reason 5: Real Wages Are Rising for Hospitality Workers

After a million stories about how small-business owners are ready to sacrifice their first born if that’s what it takes to fill a job opening, you might think wages would be surging across the board. That’s kind of the case—hourly pay among all workers did rise quickly in April and May. The problem is that those gains are currently being outstripped by inflation.

But it’s a different story in the leisure and hospitality business. There﻿, wage growth has shot up by about 5 percent since January, well above the pace of the consumer price index. America’s waiters, cooks, bartenders, and hotel maids are getting a much-needed pay bump.

Reason 6: Restaurants and Bars Are Recovering

The coronavirus recession was, for the most part, a services-sector recession—restaurants, hotels, airlines, gyms, movie theaters … basically any space where people spend time in rooms full of lots of other people had to shut down and lay off workers. Meanwhile, sales of durable goods exploded as half of America decided to build a new deck or equip a home gym.

Advertisement

That dynamic hasn’t entirely faded yet. As of May, households were still spending more than normal on goods (up 19 percent since the pandemic started) than on services (down about 1 percent since the plague began).

And while some parts of the services sector are recovering, others are still stuck in the pits. Spending at restaurants has rebounded. But spending at hotels, sports, live entertainment, and movie theaters is all still down massively.

It's interesting to look at spending in some of the most pandemic-affected categories. Restaurants (including fast food, delivery, etc) have bounced back, but everything else is still way down. Movies, live entertainment have barely even begun to recover. pic.twitter.com/h5bkGKhlx9 — Ben Casselman (@bencasselman) June 25, 2021

Advertisement

Here’s the glass-half-full way to interpret that graph: First, the dining industry is economically important on its own. But also, if you think about the crowds at restaurants and bars as a leading indicator of people’s willingness to go out and be merry in a crowd, then the number of people packing dining rooms and bars right now is a pretty positive omen for services more broadly. If Americans will jam into a crowded dive to get a Miller Light right now (and they clearly are), then they’ll eventually flock to concerts too as time goes on and states continue lifting capacity restrictions.

Reason 7: Business Productivity Is Booming

You might be wondering how it is that restaurant sales have recovered even though they’re employing so many fewer workers than in the Before Times. The answer likely lies partly in the QR codes you’ve been scanning every time you want to pull up a menu, instead of waiting for a server. The pandemic forced businesses to make do with fewer employees, leading many to invest heavily in new software to automate parts of their business. The result, as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip recently observed, is that we seem to be “in a productivity boom.” By the end of the first quarter of 2021, output per hour was up 4.1 percent compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase in a decade.

Part of the reason productivity jumped so much during 2020 was simply that businesses laid off so many workers in the service sector, where productivity tends to be lower. The startling thing, as Bloomberg Opinion’s Noah Smith has explained, is that productivity growth actually sped up at the beginning of 2021, just as many of those employees returned to work—the opposite of what you’d expect to happen. Investment in software also accelerated from January to March. That suggests a more fundamental shift is taking place: The crisis may have finally made some businesses move into the 21st century.

Productivity growth is a crucial ingredient to a healthy, expanding economy. It’s how we learn to do more with less labor, freeing people to do other, more valuable jobs. It also allows businesses to raise wages without having to raise prices, since their employees generate more revenue. But despite the last decade’s worth of advances in tech, productivity was extremely sluggish in the years after the Great Recession. That’s what makes this recent burst so exciting; it’s not just the silver lining of a terrible year, but even, potentially, the end to a long period of relative stagnation. But will our productivity growth spurt continue? Some economists, like MIT techno-optimists Erik Brynjolfsson and Georgios Petropoulos, think it might. And if they’re right, we could be in for the sort of economic run the U.S. hasn’t seen in a long, long time."

That's a problem for Biden

President Biden's first year in the White House has ushered in record job gains, unprecedented wage gains for low-income workers and GDP growth not seen in decades.

But polls show Americans remain deeply cynical about how the president is handling the economy — and that's a problem for Biden and Democratic lawmakers heading into November's midterm elections.

The president and his advisers routinely tout statistics that show how the economy is surging by most traditional economic metrics, seemingly mystified about why the American public isn't giving Democrats more credit for this boom.

Last week, as the president delivered remarks on the January jobs report, he highlighted that in his first year in office, the economy created 6.6 million jobs.

""If you can't remember another year when so many people went to work in this country, there's a reason: It never happened,"" Biden said, telling reporters to look at economic statistics dating back 40 years to President Ronald Reagan. ""History has been made here,"" he said.

But there's piece of economic data reaching levels not seen in 40 years: inflation. And that's an issue that Biden and his White House have struggled to address.

On Thursday, new data showed consumer prices are up 7.5% from where they were a year ago. Inflation is at its highest point since 1982 as the cost for food, electricity and shelter soar.

Biden didn't focus on inflation during his Virginia trip — despite the new data

Shortly after the inflation data was released, Biden traveled to the Virginia district of Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger. She was first elected in 2018 in a former Republican stronghold by a narrow margin, and Republicans are working hard to flip the district in November.

Democrats like Spanberger in vulnerable districts have urged the White House to spend less time on its proposal for massive spending on the social safety net and more time on inflation and other economic issues.

While Biden briefly acknowledged that food and gas prices are up, he kept his focus on his plan, known as Build Back Better — arguing that it would lower costs for things like prescription drugs and childcare.

""You want to lower the cost of living for people — lower them in these areas,"" Biden said about his plan.

The plan has passed the House of Representatives, but seems all but dead in the Senate, where Democratic Senator Joe Manchin has said he opposes new government spending, given inflation.

Inflation is surging, and that's hitting voters where it hurts

Despite the many positive economic data points seen this year, economists and analysts say that people experience inflation on a visceral level — and that gives it outsized influence.

""Inflation is something people feel in a different way than they do other economic indicators,"" said Jack Lew, who was Treasury secretary during the Obama administration. ""The price of gas is reflected every time you get a tank of gas.""

Larry Summers, director of the National Economic Council under President Barack Obama, has been sounding the alarm on inflation for months.

""More unemployment is the difference between a job and not a job for 2 or 3% of the population. More inflation is higher prices for 100% of the population,"" Summers said.

Inflation makes people unhappy in ways that are disproportionate to the actual concerns that economists have about inflation, he said.

""People tend to think that ... higher prices are something that's being stolen from them,"" Summers said.

In other words, people feel ripped off by inflation.

There's not that much Biden can do about inflation

Inflation is complicated. Whether it goes up or down is largely in the hands of the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for interest rates.

Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School in New York, said context is key. ""We just experienced the deepest decline on record. And likewise, the quickest recovery on record,"" Hamilton explained.

""A lot of that had to do with an intervention from the government that allowed us to withstand that pandemic. So there's going to be inflation.""

Some economists point to last year's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 aid package known as the American Rescue Plan as one of the reasons behind the inflation seen today, but the alternative could have been more dangerous. They fear that without the COVID-19 relief money, the economy would have spiraled into a recession.

Hamilton argues that the inflation debate has been driven by ""strategic political gaslighting"" from Republicans that is ""exploiting anxiety around things like inflation."" He agrees with the Biden administration's assessment that the current spike in inflation is temporary.

It's hard for Biden to take credit for the economy, given rising prices

Wages have risen for low-income workers, but many feel like the raises they've received have been wiped out by rising prices.

""There's an old notion that you cannot tell people how they feel and that they feel better than they do,"" said Lew, the former Treasury secretary.

The Biden team has to balance taking credit for accomplishments like the COVID-19 relief bill with the reality that COVID-19 and inflation are still very much on the minds of people every day, he said.

Lew recalled the Obama White House facing a similar messaging challenge during the recovery from the 2007-2009 Great Recession: how to tout the president's accomplishments while acknowledging people still needed more help.

COVID-19 fatigue is also feeding into how voters feel about the economy

On top of inflation woes, many voters are frustrated and exhausted by the coronavirus pandemic and see the economy through that lens. Analysts and pollsters say voters remain anxious about economic instability resulting from some future new, unexpected coronavirus variant.

There is evidence that people's views of the economy are often based on expectations of change, rather than the current reality, economists said. So after a fleeting summer of optimism, as the pandemic has dragged on, people have become more pessimistic about their economic future.

""Until the time when the pandemic is done, you know people are going to be upset about the economy,"" said Austan Goolsbee, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.

""It doesn't matter if you read in the paper that the unemployment rate is way down and we added more jobs than we've ever added in a year. It doesn't, as long as we are in a worse spot than we wanted to be,"" he said.

Goolsbee sees the president's approval rating on the economy as essentially a barometer for how people feel about the pandemic. And ultimately, until COVID-19 isn't constantly hanging over their lives, he's not convinced that even a lower inflation rate would have the power to fundamentally alter how people feel about the economy.

Biden has changed how he talks about inflation, but needs to repeat it more often, pollster says

Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says voters in polls and focus groups have been anxious about the economy for months.

""The instability is really unnerving the public,"" she said. Voters are worried about economic volatility and the rising cost of living.

""It hits them every day, it hits them every purchase and it really makes them feel depressed about the economy,"" Lake said. ""They're convinced that wages are not keeping up with the rising cost because you get a paycheck twice a month — you buy something that's more expensive every day.""

Initially, the president and his team used the term ""transitory"" to insist that price increases were not a permanent thing.

But over time, Biden pivoted and began acknowledging more of the pain that people were feeling at the gas pump and the grocery store.

""I think he's doing a lot of that in his current messaging, but we've got to repeat, repeat, repeat,"" Lake said.

The president's approval ratings are a big factor for the midterm elections

Emory University political science professor Alan Abramowitz has looked at the results of every midterm election dating back to World War II and says a president's approval rating is a far better predictor of what will transpire in the midterms than any economic indicator.

""No matter how good or bad the economy is, if people perceive it as bad, that's going to probably hurt the president and hurt the president's party in the midterm election,"" he said.

Since inflation seems to be dragging the president's numbers down, analysts say Biden needs to make it clear he's concerned about the problem — whether or not he has the ability to actually fix it.

""Bill Clinton once said when there's a problem, people don't necessarily expect you to solve it overnight, but they have to catch you trying,"" said Bill Galston, former domestic policy adviser in the Clinton White House and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

""So, if I were Biden's scheduler, I would have him out a couple of days a week dramatizing his commitment to the fight against inflation."""
Mar 31 2020,It’s time for a massive wartime mobilization to save the economy,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/31/21191561/coronavirus-depression-recession-unemployment,"A dangerous myth is taking hold in the United States that the country must decide between saving the economy at the expense of risking many additional Covid-19 deaths and a depression leading to double-digit unemployment.

Trump says that the cure for the virus can’t be more costly than the virus itself. Others, like former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, caution that the US must stick with stringent public health measures, but simply can’t fix the economy “until we contain the virus.”

But this is a false choice. The virus’s hit to the economy is real. But beyond the direct hit from the pandemic, the US is experiencing an economy-wide collapse in demand, as job losses lead to income losses, which lead to reduced spending and further job losses. There is a climate of concern, and people who haven’t lost jobs and incomes worry that they may do so soon and restrain their spending. There is a pinch on state and local budgets that is causing cutbacks on front-line labor as there’s more, not less, work to do.

And despite frantic moves from the Federal Reserve last week and a big stimulus bill from Congress, the steps taken thus far are too small and too timid — like a series of mattresses to cushion the fall when the US needs a trampoline to bounce everyone back to full employment. That’s not a job that can afford to wait until after the epidemiological crisis is solved any more than the Allies waited until after defeating Hitler to cure the Great Depression. The US needs to beat the virus in part through a massive, deliberate mobilization that puts people back to work.

America needs a strategy for recovery, not just rescue

Businesses across the country have been forced to either shut down or dramatically curtail their activities because of the virus.

That inevitably leads to job losses and a declining stock market. But if you broaden your set of economic indicators — including currencies (where the dollar is getting stronger), commodities (where everything from oil to corn to metal has gotten cheaper), bonds (where government interest rates have fallen), and inflation (where expectations are of slower price increases) — you see a second story, a crisis of falling demand.

And though the measures taken by Congress and the Fed last week led to a clear improvement in the indicators, they weren’t nearly enough to address the crisis.

The US needs to take the analogy of wartime mobilization that’s been used by many leaders much more seriously and deliver trillions more in tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate demand. Much of that spending should be aimed at mobilizing workers and industry to provide the goods and services the US needs to continue coping with a virus that, even if successfully contained, is not going to vanish soon.

To cope with the twin crises of economics and public health, the US will need substantial investment in the production of personal protective equipment for health care workers, but may also need production of masks and gloves for the public. It will need a huge infusion of funds to state and local governments so they can continue to provide — even expand — needed services. It will need medical research in spades, and we’ll need income support for households and businesses as they struggle to adapt to a new world of doing things in less efficient, more socially distant ways. And to support it all, the US needs a creative and flexible Federal Reserve willing to adopt a wartime mentality to finance.

Economic policy can’t fix everything, but it can fix a lot

A few years ago, Christina Romer, who served as the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama, and her husband David co-wrote my favorite paper about macroeconomics.

It’s called “The Most Dangerous Idea in Federal Reserve History: Monetary Policy Doesn’t Matter.” In the paper, the Romers review three tragic episodes in American economic history — the early phases of the Great Depression, the Great Inflation of the 1970s, and the extended Great Recession that began in 2008 and left America with labor market weakness that lingered up until the moment the coronavirus hit.

They show that in each of these episodes, policymakers convinced themselves that because of special unique attributes of the situation, there was nothing more that they could do on the demand side of the economy.

In 1930, for example, as the Great Depression gathered, George Norris of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve spoke against the idea of extra stimulus. In his view, the real problem was the extraordinary stock market bubble of the 1920s. “The consequences of such an economic debauch,” he argued to other Fed officials, “are inevitable. We are now suffering them. Can they be corrected or removed by cheap money? We do not believe that they can.”

In the 1970s, the problem was inflation rather than mass unemployment. And William Miller, then chair of the Federal Reserve, insisted that it wasn’t his problem to solve, telling Congress that “an effective program to reduce the rate of inflation had to extend beyond monetary policy” and instead focus on deregulatory and anti-union policy “designed to enhance competition and to correct structural problems.”

And in the wake of the Great Recession, distinguished economists started coming up with fanciful explanations for why labor force growth was persistently slow, even at one point deciding that advances in video game quality rather than a weak job market were to blame.

But in the first two instances, once policymakers — President Franklin Roosevelt in the case of the Great Depression, Fed Chair Paul Volcker in the case of inflation — actually accepted responsibility for solving the problem, they took action by abandoning the gold standard in the former case and with painful but relatively brief spikes in interest rates in the latter.

The Great Recession never had such a decisive turning point, but exactly as the Romers predicted, over time growing demand just kept pushing the job numbers up steadily throughout both the Obama and Trump presidencies.

So I was alarmed to see something Christina Romer told my colleague Ezra Klein:

“I feel like we need a new term for the kind of unemployment we’re going to have,” says Christina Romer, the Berkeley economist who led President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers during the financial crisis. “It’s not cyclical unemployment. It’s quarantine unemployment. Businesses aren’t allowed to operate. People aren’t allowed to be out of their home. The idea that if you just give people money it’ll somehow prevent the unemployment rate from skyrocketing makes no sense. No amount of demand stimulus will get people to go to restaurants if they’re closed.”

What Romer is saying is that the US needs humanitarian relief to help people who can’t work, rather than expecting stimulus to create jobs.

But that’s a huge overstatement. She teaches at UC Berkeley in California, which is under some of the strictest lockdown orders in the country. Yet restaurants in Berkeley are not closed — many of them are offering food for pickup or delivery.

The novelists Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon announced on Twitter a plan to buy 25 meals a week from local restaurants to give to nearby hospital workers — a nice gesture for the community. And one thing that makes it a nice gesture, of course, is that lots of people are constrained in the number of restaurant meals they can consume by their income.

Do you run an East Bay restaurant? Once a week for as long as this lasts @michaelchabon and I will buy 25 meals from you and deliver them to the Highland Hospital ER staff. Cash for you, food for them! Win win! Email me at ayeletw@gmail.com. Spread the word. — Ayelet Waldman (@ayeletw) March 21, 2020

It’s also true that there are plenty of affluent people who eat out frequently who are going to be cutting back for non-financial reasons during this crisis. But it’s a big mistake to think that everyone is in that boat, or that the US has to simply give up on the idea of keeping people engaged in meaningful work.

Signs of demand shortfall are everywhere

Even in the midst of the current crisis, some companies are hiring. Instacart says it’s looking to add 300,000 staff as demand for grocery delivery picks up. Amazon says it’s going to hire 100,000 new people, and Domino’s Pizza expects to add 10,000 more workers.

A crisis for some is an opportunity for others. And in an appropriately stimulated economy, workers laid off from some sectors would gain new jobs in others. But something I’ve noticed in my Washington, DC, neighborhood is that even though supermarkets and hardware stores are still open, they are curtailing hours rather than expanding them.

Prudent people are trying to shop at the least crowded possible times in order to minimize human contact — typically at odd hours. The Whole Foods in my neighborhood is normally open from 7 am to 10 pm. The store has established special hours for people ages 60 and older, from 6 am to 7 am, and it is closing early at 9 pm. In a healthier economic environment, the store would be opening early and closing late — adding shifts to cover those times and adding workers to do extra cleaning and disinfecting.

This might lead to price increases for some retail goods, partially offsetting retailers’ reduced costs for commodities and the fuel to get things shipped. Nobody likes to see high prices. But that’s what you’d expect to see from an appropriately stimulated economy — overall stable or slightly rising inflation as total spending levels stay steady even though the virus is disrupting exactly what people spend money on.

Instead, aggregate spending is collapsing. Recode’s Peter Kafka reports that even as news consumption is soaring, the advertising market is shrinking. BuzzFeed News announced across-the-board salary cuts. This isn’t the virus forcing media companies to shut down or making it impossible to buy laptops. It’s the secondary and tertiary demand impacts that are creating a generalized economic crisis.

How to fix the problem: Spend, mobilize, recalibrate

Congress has declared victory and gone home, but it’s important for leaders in both parties to stay engaged. They need to keep monitoring the situation and continue passing new stimulative measures until there are clear indications that things have gone far enough on the demand side.

That’s going to mean primarily pushing a lot more money out the door.

Secondarily, the federal government needs to mobilize the country to address the virus — working with private industry, but also plenty of pushing cash out to state and local governments to do things.

Last but by no means least, the Federal Reserve— the American government’s premier demand-management agency — needs to commit to allowing a small spurt of inflation if that’s what it takes to ride out this crisis, and to extending maximum support to whatever the nation’s elected officials decide to spend money on.

Fed Chair Jay Powell’s announcements last week pointed in that direction, but everyone would benefit from a clear and consistent statement from the central bank that it supports fully and swiftly returning to full employment, even if it means a temporarily elevated pace of price increases. If people look back on the year 2020 and see that the big problem was 4 percent inflation, rather than mass unemployment or the widespread collapse of hospital systems, that’s a victory.

Push out more money

At the very beginning of the crisis, President Trump was said to be interested in a major payroll tax cut.

Eventually he got talked out of that by Democrats who argued that generous unemployment insurance benefits and flat cash transfers to households should be higher priorities. That was the right judgment, but with demand still not fully stabilized, it would make sense to go back and look at the payroll tax issue.

The kind of companies that are still enjoying healthy sales — from giants like Target to the little hardware store across the street from my house — would be more likely to expand staff and rehire some newly unemployed workers if employer-side payroll taxes fell. Employers whose businesses have been hurt by the crisis but who aren’t forced into closure by it will, similarly, have an easier time avoiding layoffs if they get a tax break.

Meanwhile, the millions of Americans who haven’t lost their jobs but are dealing with unusually difficult working conditions, complicated child care situations, and other problems could use a boost from a worker-side payroll tax cut.

Depending on the market reaction to that, it could also make sense to do more rounds of cutting universal checks. Even while maintaining fairly severe social distancing, reasonable people might want to splurge on home exercise equipment, new toys and activities for kids, better equipment for your home office, or remote consultations with medical doctors or psychotherapists.

Deliver the goods and services people need

The political controversy du jour is Trump’s reluctance to invoke the Defense Production Act (DPA) and secure critically needed ventilators and personal protective equipment for front-line health care workers. He should do all that. But the government at all levels should also acknowledge that our wartime production needs are broader than the most critical supplies. The acute shortage of N95 respirators facing medical personnel treating Covid-19 patients obviously needs to be fixed first. But instead of managing the shortage by telling the public surgical masks aren’t useful, the US ought to make more masks and widen the circle of people who get them.

The gap between our current situation — where front-line health personnel can’t get the basic equipment they need — and a realm where everyone is amply provisioned with masks and gloves for routine use is huge. Filling that gap will be hard. But it’s the opposite of the problem of having too many workers with nothing left for them to do. The US needs to be looking at all appropriate tools to get newly unemployed people into manufacturing masks and gloves. That probably means some mix of DPA edicts, direct subsidies for production, and guarantees that the government will purchase any “excess” supplies if the crisis ends up ending sooner than expected.

But beyond medical equipment, we are looking at a reasonably extended period of time in which people should be consuming more soap, hand sanitizer, disinfecting sprays and wipes, and lotion. Especially once the US is able to move beyond the most severe lockdown measures, we’re going to need lots of household cleaning supplies. And that means we’ll need more personnel and industrial capacity to make them.

Congress should also directly infuse state and local governments with the money they need to run things properly. Mass transit agencies are being crushed by falling ridership and have started curtailing service. Distancing best practice, however, is that transit agencies should run ample service even as commuter loads fall so that trains and buses can stay as uncrowded as possible, even while vehicles are disinfected frequently. This isn’t financially viable for local governments, but the federal government can make it viable, and in doing so support public health and employment at the same time.

More broadly, the one saving grace of the coronavirus pandemic is that the pathogen is fairly easy to kill with soap and other normal cleaning supplies. While surface spread is not thought to be the main vector of the coronavirus, high-touch surfaces in playgrounds, parks, and other public spaces could and perhaps should be routinely disinfected as part of a transitional strategy to getting things partially opened up again. The barrier to doing that is simply cost.

But that’s just another way of saying the virus hasn’t eliminated our need for labor. There is plenty for workers to do instead of being unemployed, as long as people refuse to accept mass unemployment as inevitable. Rather than it being necessary to completely fix the health situation before the US can heal the economy, mobilizing idled workers should be part of how to get the health situation under control.

Wartime central banking

But to undergird it all, Americans need a cooperative central bank.

The question of Federal Reserve action is intimately linked to the inevitable question of whether the country can really afford to engage in stimulus on this level. And the answer is yes.

Since the 1951 Fed/Treasury Accord, the Fed has operated independently of the rest of the American government. But as Jessica Romero of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond recounts in his history of the accord, “during World War II and its aftermath the Federal Reserve did not enjoy such independence.” Instead, “at the request of the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve formally committed to maintaining a low interest-rate peg of 3/8 percent on short-term Treasury bills. The Fed also implicitly capped the rate on long-term Treasury bonds at 2.5 percent.”

The point of this was to make sure it was affordable for the government to borrow the money it would need to fight and win the war. Current interest rates are less than half of where they were set as an emergency wartime finance measure, and the Fed has announced that it’s willing to engage in unlimited purchases of government bonds “to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and the economy.”

What’s further needed from the Fed is a clearer statement of the goals of its activity. In the past generation, the central bank’s overwhelming focus has been on ensuring that inflation stays near but below a target of 2 percent.

To support an adequate recovery, the Fed should state clearly that its goal is to help fiscal authorities fully eliminate any shortfall in demand. That means as long as the virus is with us, we should be willing to see inflation rise above 2 percent levels, as you would expect to see in an economy suffering from a supply-side problem.

A lot of commercial transactions, even when they restart, will have to be conducted in slightly cumbersome ways with more emphasis on delivery, uncrowded spaces, and lots of disinfecting. That will mean a higher cost structure, higher prices, and lower economic output — real economic problems that stimulative policy can’t fix and that will ameliorate only as testing, treatment, and vaccination will improve. But it won’t have to mean mass unemployment or a chilling choice between overwhelmed hospitals and a depression.

A depression is a choice

The corners of the economic policy world I follow are spending a lot of time playing armchair epidemiologist and debating various theories about how deadly Covid-19 really is and how useful lockdown-type policies really are in combating it.

These are important questions, and in these uncertain times, I am also interested in them. Trump has become personally enthusiastic about the prospects of using hydroxychloroquine, perhaps in combination with azithromycin, as a pharmaceutical treatment for Covid-19. (The research so far on the effectiveness of such treatment is preliminary and mixed.)

I hope some of that pans out, too, and it’s not unreasonable to try to maintain some optimism on the epidemiological side.

But this also has an air of grasping at straws about it. Both the human mind and the political system rebel at the idea that the current bleak economic picture Americans are seeing is our only alternative to a world with increasing sickness from a new virus.

We need to be clear-eyed, however: That false choice only exists because we aren’t thinking big enough about economic policy. Both the virus itself and the public health countermeasures that have been put into place to combat it are costly to the national economy. But the financial market indicators we can see are a clear indication that these costs are being exacerbated by a second wave of problems — demand-side problems — that are actually larger in scale than the problems on the supply side.

And unlike on the epidemiological side, the solutions to a demand crisis are actually very clear.

We are already poised to begin significant fiscal stimulus, and that has helped. But to get to where we need to be, we need to do even more — put more cash into state and local government coffers, cut taxes on individuals and businesses, put money directly into the hands of the American people, and finance increased production of medical and household cleaning supplies.

A program like that won’t eliminate the economic costs of coronavirus. Huge amounts of labor will be “wasted” on cleaning and re-cleaning surfaces, and manufacturing supplies that are swiftly used up and thrown away rather than building wealth. But it will avoid mass unemployment, cascading waves of bankruptcies, and the other miseries associated with a depression. And since the economic problems will be genuinely virus-related, they will go away whenever the medical situation improves — whether that’s because of improved testing, improved treatments, new findings that it’s not as deadly as we feared, or whatever else.

The problem with the demand shock is that it is currently bigger in economic terms than the supply-side impacts of the virus itself. And — because it’s caused by policy failure rather than RNA strands replicating in our cells — there’s no guarantee it goes away, even if there is a totally effective vaccine a year from now.

It’s time for economic policymakers to let the doctors, epidemiologists, and other public health officials do their jobs, and to start taking responsibility for doing their own work instead. The virus is a fact we have to deal with. The ongoing collapse in aggregate demand is a policy choice we can avoid.

Dec 23 2016,"If Donald Trump supercharges economy, who will benefit?",Christian Science Monitor,center,http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/1223/If-Donald-Trump-supercharges-economy-who-will-benefit,"Donald Trump’s economic plan could be boiled down to one word: growth. He reckons that the economy can grow faster – up to 4 percent a year – and put millions more Americans back to work, primarily by adopting a Reagan-style formula of sweeping tax cuts and lighter regulations.

It is an ambitious goal. The economy has averaged only 2.1 percent annual growth since 2009, and the central challenge, economists say, is not policy so much as the fact that more mature economies grow more slowly.

Yet even if Trump were to fuel a faster expansion than President Obama, there are questions about what that would feel like for American households.

By Mr. Trump’s reckoning, a thriving economy lifts all workers – and that has been true in the past, most recently during the 1990s. But many economists counter that the Reagan-era economic mantra Trump is adopting has been a primary driver of income inequality – putting more money in the pockets of the rich and upper-middle class and keeping a lid on middle-income earnings.

Today’s economy shows the continuing effects of those Reagan-era shifts, and other global trends such as automation and outsourcing, these economists add. Some households are moving up the income ladder, but since 2000 more are sliding down. And the likelihood that today’s youth will earn more than their parents – a staple of the American dream – appears to be declining.

“Because of structural changes in this economy, both from globalization and technological change, if you get 4 percent [economic] growth today, then the benefits of that growth would not be shared as equally as in past decades. That’s the core point you want to begin with,” says James Pethokoukis, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington.

Trump's job No. 1: A roaring economy

From the start of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump has appealed to the working class through bold promises on job creation and by touting potential gains from renegotiating trade pacts. Since the election, his transition team has emphasized tax cuts, regulatory reforms, and changes to energy policy to stimulate the economy and accelerate the pace of job creation.

There has been less emphasis on tackling the disparities that have funneled the greatest gains to the top because Trump’s team believes that the best answer to wage stagnation is a roaring economy.

“Faster growth in itself will achieve the growth in incomes in the lower income groups that need it,” says Diana Furchtgott-Roth, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a member of Trump’s transition team.

That scenario played out in the late 1990s, when a sustained boom under President Clinton translated into higher wages and longer hours and more overtime for nearly all workers. It was also a period when wage gains were seen year by year, across the board, from bank tellers to truck drivers, before a tech-stock crash led to a recession in 2001.

For conservatives, it’s a potent message: economic growth can help the needy in ways that big government can’t. “The difference between poverty and non-poverty in America is work, and having people at work,” says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office under President George W Bush.

The '90s exception

Yet the Clinton-era boom was the exception, not the rule, says Lane Kenworthy, a political scientist at the University of Arizona who studies economic inequality. “It was the only period [since the late 1970s] that we saw sustained wage increases up and down the distribution ladder,” he says.

By contrast, a smaller share of the economic gains of the mid-to-late 1980s, when annual growth averaged 4.6 percent, went to middle-class households.

The 2000s, meanwhile, offer a mixed picture. According to one analysis, they were largely a wash, in part because of the collapse of the housing market hurt most income brackets.

But a 2016 study by the International Monetary Fund found that 2000 marked a turning point for the middle class in the United States. Before that year, more middle-class families rose up the ladder than fell down. From 2000 to 2014, however, nearly all the shift was downward.

Seven years of expansion under Mr. Obama could now be starting to have an effect. Average household incomes jumped 5.2 percent in 2015 to the highest level since 2007. That suggests that Trump will be taking the reins of an economy that’s near to full employment and could deliver more gains to working families.

How to fix income inequality

But figuring out how inequality might affect economic growth is tricky.

The IMF study argues that the polarization of incomes – fewer households in the middle, and more clustered at the top and bottom – hurts economic growth, since the rich are less likely to spend their earnings. Consumer spending is the main engine of growth in developed economies.

Prominent left-leaning economists like Joseph Stiglitz argue that middle-class stagnation and soaring wealth at the top are a brake on the economy that require broader government intervention – a higher minimum wage, paid parental leave, worker protection – and more progressive taxation.

Conservatives say solutions to inequality lie in welfare reforms, workforce skills training, promoting marriage and stable families, and greater choice in K-12 education. Allowing more oil and gas drilling, as Trump proposes, would help the poor, who spend proportionately more on fuel and heating, says Ms. Furchtgott-Roth. But trying to tackle inequality by raising taxes on the wealthy risks upsetting the apple cart.

“Economic growth hasn’t risen as much as many of us would like. But some of the [liberal] solutions to income inequality would result in lower economic growth,” says Furchtgott-Roth, a former chief economist in the Department of Labor.

A fairer economy

To many Americans, what matters most is whether they have an equal shot at improving their lot – even if the rich get richer. But that no longer appears to be happening as much as it did for previous generations, according to new research into how likely children are to earn more than their parents.

The study led by Stanford economist Raj Chetty found that nearly all households saw intergenerational gains in the postwar period. But the prospects for those born after 1940 steadily declined. Only half of children born in 1980 are making more today than their parents.

The slower growth of the US economy is important since it means the total pie is smaller. But the rise in income inequality – the share of the pie each family receives – is a much greater drag, the authors say.

This suggests that even if Trump could raise growth significantly, the gains would accrue to fewer households. Marginal tax cuts would only exacerbate the inequities.

Under Obama, high earners have been taxed more, while tax credits for the poor and middle class have expanded, along with new subsidies for health insurance. The after-tax income of the top 1 percent, which peaked at 17 percent of total income in 2007, fell to 12 percent in 2013. In 1979, before the Reagan-era tax cuts, it was 7 percent.

Conservatives have pushed back against some of Professor Chetty’s findings, arguing that he may be underestimating income gains. An alternative measure of social mobility – how likely a child born into a poor household is to become rich in their lifetime – hasn’t fallen as sharply, notes Mr. Pethokoukis. But it seems increasingly clear that the American dream of upward mobility has receded for many, and that growth alone is not the solution, he says.

“We need that tide to rise, but it might not lift all boats.”"
Apr 15 2020,Resentment grows as governors pile on rules for reopening economy,Washington Times,right,https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/15/andrew-cuomo-gavin-newsom-democratic-governors-pil/,"The federal government has issued constantly evolving criteria for Americans to return to work safely during the coronavirus crisis, while various governors this week began adding their own layers of rules for reopening states for business — a process increasingly leading to partisan disputes in state capitals.

The guidance has ranged from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying on March 7 that “contact tracing” — finding every sick person and figuring out who they’ve interacted with — was recommended but “not practical or achievable in all situations,” to Tuesday, when California Gov. Gavin Newsom said contact tracing will be a key benchmark for reopening his state’s businesses and schools.

In the Northeast, seven governors led by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo are crafting their own rules for determining how and when it’s safe to reopen. All but one of them are Democrats, and some of them are talking about keeping stay-at-home restrictions in place well into June.

Face masks are another example. The CDC changed its guidance on April 3 to recommend that people wear masks in public to slow the spread of the virus, especially when social distancing isn’t possible.

President Trump said he won’t wear one, because he feels fine. But on Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo issued an executive order making it mandatory for New York residents to wear masks in public or face a possible civil fine.

Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, on Wednesday also ordered the wearing of masks in stores and on public transportation, effective Saturday.

Presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden criticized Mr. Trump for not wearing a mask.

“I wish he would stop talking and let the scientists speak. I don’t walk out of this house without a mask on,” the former vice president said.

The stakes for the economy continued to grow Wednesday. The Commerce Department reported that March retail sales fell 8.7%, the most since the government began keeping track in 1992. Auto sales fell 25.6%, while clothing purchases were down 50.5%.

New York regional manufacturing activity hit a record low, plunging a whopping 78.2%.

Major U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America increased the amount of funds set aside for bad loans by nearly $20 billion in the first quarter, earnings reports showed this week, as banks prepared for a spike in loan defaults by households and businesses.

A $350 billion emergency federal fund to help small businesses keep paying their employees was to run out of money Wednesday, just 12 days after the money became available. Congressional Democrats were continuing to block an extra $250 billion for the fund, seeking to add hundreds of billions of dollars for their own priorities.

Mr. Trump, who held conference calls with industry leaders on Wednesday, said he’ll announce new guidelines on Thursday for states to reopen.

“We’ll be talking about various states and it’s very exciting,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s been a horrible time to see such death and destruction.”

Pennsylvania state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a Republican from Chambersburg, expressed a frustration heard in many parts of the country as he recorded a video of himself on Wednesday walking through empty corridors of the state capitol in Harrisburg.

“We need common sense back,” Mr. Mastriano told his constituents on Facebook. “And we need that power back in your hands, and not in the hands of some bureaucrats in Harrisburg.”

Republican state legislators are battling with Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat who has joined forces with Mr. Cuomo and the other Northeastern governors to craft their own rules independently of the federal government. The state GOP is pushing a proposal that would allow Pennsylvania’s county commissioners to decide when to reopen their 67 counties, following guidelines from the CDC and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

“The bottom line is we need to get back to work,” Mr. Mastriano said. “It’s a crisis exacerbated by terrible decisions from our governor. He’d rather work with state leaders across the border that he agrees with ideologically, than he would his own Senate or House elected by the people.”

Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday that any ramping back up of businesses in the state will require a significant increase in COVID-19 testing capabilities and contact tracing. He said it can’t be done without more federal assistance, and that a phased reopening of the state must be done in concert with additional testing and contact tracing.

The District of Columbia on Wednesday extended its stay-at-home order until May 15. It had been due to expire on April 24. Mayor Muriel Bowser said she could extend restrictions on businesses and schools even longer.

Another factor that could affect states’ decisions is that there are two or three strains of the virus, according to studies. The stronger type A strain from Europe hit the East Coast, while a weaker version is on the West Coast.

The debate over what’s prudent and practical is taking place in other states such as Michigan, where a conservative-led “gridlock rally” at the state capitol on Wednesday demonstrated opposition to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s extended stay-at-home order.

“Citizens are frankly tired of being treated like babies,” said Marian Sheridan, Michigan Conservative Coalition co-founder, in a statement. “As adults, we now know what needs to be done to stay safe.”

Most demonstrators stayed in their vehicles to follow social-distancing guidelines, but many others could be seen congregating on the grounds of the capitol while not wearing masks.

In North Carolina, a group called “ReopenNC” has created a Facebook page that has attracted more than 35,000 members in the past week. They’re demanding that officials reopen the state by April 29.

“We are losing our small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy,” the group said. “The shutdown is not warranted, nor sustainable for our area. The vulnerable can be isolated or protected in other ways, without sacrificing our entire state economy.”

In Raleigh Tuesday, about 100 people organized by the group protested Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s stay-at-home order. One woman was arrested for violating it. On Wednesday, the North Carolina Institute for Constitutional Law offered its “assistance” to Mr. Cooper and local governments in “rescinding or revising orders unconstitutionally restricting the rights of the people to free speech and to assembly.”

“We understand the seriousness of the situation, not just in terms of COVID-19 itself but also in terms of how government is violating the Constitution during the crisis,” said Jeanette Doran, the institute’s president and general counsel.

The first known case of the virus in the U.S. arrived in Washington state from China in mid-January. Since March, federal guidelines on ensuring workplace safety have evolved.

On March 21, the CDC issued new guidance on cleaning and disinfecting to prevent workplace exposures in non-health-care settings.

On April 8, in a first step toward reopening the country, the CDC issued new guidelines to make it easier for essential workers who have been exposed to COVID-19 to get back to work. CDC Director Robert Redfield said essential employees such as health care and food supply workers, who had been within 6 feet of a confirmed or suspected case of the virus, could return to work if they had no symptoms.

The guidance advised exposed workers to take their temperatures before going to work, wear a face mask at all times, practice social distancing “as work duties permit,” and avoid sharing headsets.

Employers were asked to take employees’ temperature and assess their symptoms before they resumed work duties; send them home immediately if they became sick during the day; “increase the air exchange in the building,” and “increase the cleaning of commonly touched surfaces.”

On April 10, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the federal government was discussing issuing immunity cards to identify workers who were exposed and who could potentially return to work.

Dr. Fauci said on Wednesday that many states are unlikely to change their social distancing and coronavirus mitigation strategies in the coming weeks, as Mr. Trump prepares a path for reopening certain regions of the U.S. economy.

“There is going to be a great deal of variability,” Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Today” show. “It would probably be a rolling entry into it with some states actually doing nothing different because they’re still in a really difficult situation, and you would not want to relax any of the physical separation guidelines and others that would be doing really much better. So it’s not going to be a one-size-fits-all.”

Dr. Redfield said Wednesday that determining who is immune to the coronavirus is crucial because the virus is likely to return next year.

“This is going to be the critical question we will answer between now and next year, when it’s very likely that we’re going to have another wrestling match with this virus as it comes back,” Dr. Redfield said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” He said ramping up antibody testing is key to try to determine how many asymptomatic people spread the virus, notably in health-care settings.

Mar 02 2022,"Vulnerable Democrat Tom Malinowski Says the Economy is ‘Incredibly Strong,’ ‘Booming’",Breitbart Fact Check,right,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2022/02/25/fact-check-vulnerable-democrat-tom-malinowski-says-the-economy-is-incredibly-strong-booming/,"CLAIM: Vulnerable Democrat Rep. Tom Malinowski (NJ), during a recent town hall, was caught on camera saying the “economy is incredibly strong” and that it is “booming.” He also noted that “it is doing far better than anybody thought.”

VERDICT: Mostly False.

The economy is not doing “incredibly strong,” as the congressman says it is. In February, it was reported that consumer prices are up 7.5 percent, jumping the most in nearly four decades as the new year started. As a result, inflation is zapping the savings accounts of American family’s basic needs and added pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike the interest rates in March. Breitbart News’s John Carney wrote:

Although many economists and anti-Trump journalists claimed President Donald Trump’s tariffs would raise prices, consumer prices remained low throughout his administration. Trump’s tariffs turned out not to be taxes on consumers. Instead, they were absorbed by Chinese producers and exporters and the profit margins of most large U.S. companies. Inflation only began to accelerate last March after years of coming in below the Fed’s two percent target. The Fed had decided to keep interest rates low although the economy was recovering at a faster than expected rate. What’s more, the Biden administration pushed through billions of dollars of deficit spending in the American Rescue Plan. These combined to fuel demand for goods and services faster than supplies could expand, pushing up prices. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell, following the advice of many of the economists on the central bank’s staff, initially claimed that inflation was due to transitory factors. Fed officials forecast that inflation would fall in the latter half of 2021, predicting that supply chains would swiftly unsnarl and a rebalancing of consumer demand from goods to services would relieve pricing pressure. The Biden administration, under the tutelage of former Fed chair and now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, largely followed suit and continued to press for even more spending.

Additionally, data from the Commerce Department recently showed that the price of “big-ticket consumer goods” such as durable goods, made to last three or more years, rose over the past twelve months by 11.6 percent, which is the most significant annual increase since 1975. Furthermore, Nondurable goods prices rose by 7.2 percent, and Services prices rose by 4.6 percent.

“The inflation in the price of durable goods has been even more jarring to consumers because it follows a quarter of a century in which prices consistently fell year after year,” Carney also wrote.

In fact, the congressman supported the Democrats’ $1.2 trillion, 2,702-page so-called bipartisan infrastructure bill last year, which Biden signed into law and has been fueling inflation. He also supported the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act (BBB), which studies found would have caused more harm to the economy. It stalled in the Senate after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said he could not vote for it.

The Wall Street Journal recently published a piece acknowledging that the rise in prices and the supply chains crisis caused by the Democrats will also impact their behemoth spending bill since the costs of services are rising. The Biden-backed bill may not be able to afford the cost of roads, bridges, railways, fiber optic lines that were supposed to be fully funded from the bill:

Elevated costs for materials and labor are already pushing contractors to charge more for construction projects, government data show, increases that economists and industry officials say could reduce the number of infrastructure projects the new federal money can finance. State and local officials facing higher prices may give priority to easier, less ambitious projects, and some worry that a rush of government spending could exacerbate inflation in the industry. The cost of construction projects for government rose 13% in January compared with a year earlier, according to supplier price information released by the Labor Department last week. The producer-price index also showed input prices for construction of highways and streets was up 20% from a year earlier, with steel mill products and plastic construction products up 113% and 35%, respectively, over a year. The price of gasoline and diesel fuel are each up more than 50%. Those cost increases well outpace consumer inflation, which advanced 7.5% in the past year, the fastest rate in four decades. Some in the industry hope technological advancements, as well as new employment opportunities generated by the federal infrastructure spending, could mitigate the labor shortage. But Ken Simonson, the chief economist for the Associated General Contractors of America, said greater flexibility and rising wages at other jobs may limit the draw of new workers into the construction jobs, where workers need to be on site.

“Tom Malinowski must be living in an alternate universe,” said Congressional Leadership Fund Press Secretary Cally Perkins. “If Malinowski thinks the economy is ‘booming,’ then clearly he’s so out of touch with the working class that he has no business representing them in Congress.”

There are some parts of the economy that have shown resilience despite inflation. Consumer spending was stronger than expected in January. Unemployment is very low, although still above the level of the prepandemic Trump era. The travel and leisure sectors are reviving. The economy grew 5.7 percent last year and is expected to grow another four percent this year.

Jul 17 2022,"Fox News Poll: Voters say the economy is bad, and they expect it will get worse",Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-say-economy-bad-expect-get-worse,"Almost all voters are worried about inflation, large numbers continue to rate the economy negatively -- and a majority expects things will be worse next year.

The latest Fox News survey also finds both Democrats and Republicans are equally motivated to vote, and that if the midterm election were today, 41% of voters would back the Democratic candidate in their House district and 44% the Republican.

That 3-point edge is unchanged from June and within the poll’s margin of sampling error. However, this is the seventh straight poll since December where the Republicans have been ahead, ranging from one to seven points.

MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T SUPPORT CLIMATE, TAX PROVISIONS IN SWEEPING DEMOCRATIC BILL

According to Fox News modeling, a 3-point edge translates into a GOP gain of about 23 seats.

""A 20-plus seat gain would be massive for the Republicans in an era where bipartisan gerrymandering has drastically reduced the number of competitive seats,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw. ""It would be tantamount to the 1994 midterms when Newt Gingrich’s Contract with America helped the GOP roll up a 54-seat gain."" Shaw conducts the Fox News survey with Democratic counterpart Chris Anderson.

The generic ballot tends to overstate the Democrats’ chances of winning individual House races because it comes from a survey of registered voters across the country, and not from a series of individual Congressional district surveys. Because more districts have been drawn to be overwhelmingly Democratic than overwhelmingly Republican, the Democrats need a higher generic ballot number to expect to win more actual seats.

In other findings, 15% of all voters are undecided or plan to back a third-party candidate for Congress -- including 60% of independents. While it is uncertain how they will vote in November, today more than 7 in 10 of both these groups disapprove of the job President Biden is doing.

The president’s job rating hit a low this week, with 40% of voters approving and 59% disapproving. That’s net negative by 19 points. His ratings were underwater by 14 points last month and by 8 points in early May. Biden’s best marks were in June 2021, when 56% approved and 43% disapproved.

Four years ago, at this same point in the election cycle, former President Donald Trump’s job rating was underwater by 5 points: 46% approved and 51% disapproved (July 2018).

Biden gets the thumbs-down from record numbers of women, Black voters, moderates, voters under age 30, Democrats, and independents.

And majorities overall disapprove of his issue performance: 73% disapprove on inflation, 68% on the economy, 61% on immigration, 59% on guns, 57% on energy policy, and 55% on handling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Just 17% rate the economy positively, the lowest in nearly 10 years. Eighty-four percent say it is in only fair or poor shape.

And a 52% majority thinks it will be worse next year. This is the first time in intermittent surveys going back to 1998 that over half have felt the economy will be worse a year from now.

Meanwhile, 52% have changed their summer travel plans because of gas prices, 70% have had to cut back on other spending to afford necessities, and 75% say inflation has caused them financial hardship -- up from 67% in December.

Many fault the White House for that. Fifty-five percent say the administration has made the economy worse, and more voters blame Biden (31%) for gas prices than think Russia (20%) or oil companies (14%) are responsible.

""This is a horrendous midterm environment for the Democrats, but the Supreme Court overturning Roe provides an opportunity to mitigate losses by painting Republicans as extremists who are intent on taking away long-standing rights,"" says Anderson. ""It likely won’t be enough to hold the House, but in some districts, especially those with more independents, it could tip races to Democrats.""

As inflation hit its highest rate since 1981 on Wednesday, there’s little wonder why a large majority, 93%, are extremely or very concerned about rising prices. That’s more than say the same about higher crime rates (85%), the future of American democracy (83%), gun laws (78%), and abortion policy (70%). Some 69% are concerned about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while 62% are worried about illegal immigration.

Pandemic concerns are down nearly 20 points since January, with 53% worrying today -- the lowest in a year.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: BUILD BACK BETTER BUDGET FIGHT RETURNS, THIS TIME AMID MORE INFLATION

In the last two months, concern increased on the issues of inflation (+6 points), crime (+6), and guns (+5), while it declined on illegal immigration (-9) and the war (-11). Concern over abortion and the future of American democracy held steady.

Voters are more likely to back the Democratic congressional candidate if they are extremely concerned about gun laws (by 15 points), abortion policy (+19), Ukraine (+14), and coronavirus (+23). They prefer the Republican candidate if they are extremely concerned about inflation (by 15 points), crime (+18), and illegal immigration (+45).

Vote preference splits among those highly worried about the future of democracy: 46% favor the Democrat, 44% the Republican.

The generic Democratic candidate is ahead among Black voters, Hispanic voters, moderates, and suburban women, while the generic Republican is preferred among White voters, men, voters over age 45, and Whites without a college degree.

More voters think the Republican Party has a clear plan for dealing with the country’s problems while more say the Democratic Party cares about people like them.

But the sad takeaway is majorities don’t think either party has a plan to address the nation’s woes -- or cares about their problems.

Over half, 54%, say the Republican Party doesn’t have a clear plan and 62% say the same about the Democratic Party.

Similarly, 53% think the Democratic Party doesn’t care about people like them, while 58% feel that way about the GOP.

Comparable numbers of Democrats (66%) and Republicans (70%) think their party has a plan, but more Republicans (23%) than Democrats (15%) feel their party lacks empathy.

Two-thirds of Democrats and Republicans (67% each) are ""extremely"" motivated to vote in the November election, and party loyalty is about equal as well, as about 9 in 10 Democrats and Republicans favor their party’s candidate.

Voters are uninterested in a 2020 election mulligan.

Only about 3 voters in 10 want Biden to run for president again in 2024, while nearly 4 in 10 want Trump to run again. More Republicans (67%) want Trump to run than Democrats (51%) want Biden in the race. More than double the number of independents want Trump to run (34% vs. 14% for Biden).

Poll-pourri

At the end of last year, voters said the breakdown of moral values and weaker criminal penalties were the top reasons behind rising crime rates across the country. The largest number, 24%, now blames the availability of guns, up from 13% in December. That’s closely followed by breakdown of values (21%), weaker penalties (16%), and more mental health issues (13%).

About the same number of Democrats, Republicans, and independents support establishing term limits for Congress. All in all, 81% of voters favor the idea. Fewer, but still sizable majorities, want a mandatory retirement age for Supreme Court justices (71%) or favor an 18-year term limit for justices (66%).

Thirty-nine percent of voters approve of the job Vice President Kamala Harris is doing, while 58% disapprove -- her worst marks to date.

Oct 16 2022,Democrats Spent $2 Trillion to Save the Economy. They Don’t Want to Talk About It.,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/16/business/democrats-economic-aid-midterms.html,"In the midst of a critical runoff campaign that would determine control of the Senate, the Rev. Raphael Warnock promised Georgia voters that, if elected, he would help President-elect Biden send checks to people digging out of the pandemic recession.

Mr. Warnock won. Democrats delivered payments of up to $1,400 per person.

But this year, as Mr. Warnock is locked in a tight re-election campaign, he barely talks about those checks.

Democratic candidates in competitive Senate races this fall have spent little time on the trail or the airwaves touting the centerpiece provisions of their party’s $1.9 trillion economic rescue package, which party leaders had hoped would help stave off losses in the House and Senate in midterm elections. In part, that is because the rescue plan has become fodder for Republicans to attack Democrats over rapidly rising prices, accusing them of overstimulating the economy with too much cash.

The economic aid, which was intended to help keep families afloat amid the pandemic, included two centerpiece components for households: the direct checks of up to $1,400 for lower- to middle-class individuals and an expanded child tax credit, worth up to $300 per child per month. It was initially seen as Mr. Biden’s signature economic policy achievement, in part because the tax credit dramatically reduced child poverty last year. Polls suggested Americans knew they had received money and why — giving Democrats hope they would be rewarded politically."

Members of the Senate Banking Committee squabbled Tuesday over how quickly the U.S. economy can rebound from the coronavirus shutdown and whether the federal government is doing enough to support struggling families and businesses in the meantime.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell defended the government's multi-trillion-dollar relief efforts to date. Powell stressed additional measures may be necessary to prevent lasting economic damage.

The challenges of reopening parts of the economy were underscored by the hearing's format. It was held virtually, with both witnesses and senators on videoconference, though Mnuchin said he would have been willing to testify in person.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the committee, accused the Trump administration of pushing businesses to reopen prematurely, without adequate safeguards for workers.

""How many workers should give their lives to increase our GDP by half a percent?"" Brown asked.

Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., countered: ""The longer that we continue a shutdown — when weeks turn into months — doesn't that necessarily increase the risk that some businesses will fail, some jobs won't be there to go back to?""

The treasury secretary agreed.

Mnuchin and Powell said the Fed's emergency lending programs for midsize businesses and for state and local governments should be up and running by the end of this month.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., complained that those programs — authorized by Congress with some $450 billion in seed money — do not including binding requirements that loan recipients keep workers on the payroll.

""We're in a situation where 35 million Americans have filed for unemployment,"" Warren said. ""You're in charge of half a trillion dollars. You're boosting your Wall Street buddies and you are leaving Americans behind.""

Mnuchin disputed that characterization and said the terms of the lending programs had been negotiated with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

The treasury secretary also said the government is willing to take some risks in financing the emergency loans.

""We are fully prepared to take losses in certain scenarios,"" Mnuchin said.

Powell reiterated his view that Congress may have to authorize additional relief spending to keep families, businesses and cash-strapped state and local governments afloat until the virus is under control.

""What Congress has done to date has been remarkably timely and forceful,"" the Fed chairman said. ""I do think we need to take a step back and ask, over time, is it enough? And we need to be prepared to act further.""

In addition to the Fed's lending programs, the government has made hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loans to small businesses, which can be forgiven so long as most of the money is used for payroll. Mnuchin said he's eager to work with lawmakers to give borrowers in that program more flexibility."
May 13 2020,Panel finds experts skittish on quick reopening of economy,Roll Call,center,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/05/13/panel-finds-experts-skittish-on-quick-reopening-of-economy/,"Experts appearing before the first hearing of a new COVID-19 panel agreed on several common strategies to use in decisions about reopening the economy, as lawmakers bickered over the format of the hearing itself.

In the inaugural hearing by the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, both parties emphasized the importance of taking steps to ease economic restrictions, albeit in different ways.

Democrats have pushed for a more cautious approach, while some Republican-led states have been quicker to lift restrictions on businesses.

“While we all want to reopen as soon as possible, doing so before the proper safeguards are in place will cause more sickness and death. A premature opening would also cause greater harm to the economy,” said House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., who chaired the hearing.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the select committee’s ranking member, led a chorus of House Republicans who complained that it’s time to reopen the economy as well as in-person congressional activities.

“Unfortunately, the fact that the House is still not back in session runs counter to the message that we can safely reopen. This subcommittee along with the rest of Congress should be back here in D.C. for this briefing,” said Scalise. “A virtual briefing unnecessarily sends the wrong message.”

Lawmakers’ comments

House Democrats and Republicans took different approaches to their limited time for questioning a panel of five experts.

Democrats blamed the Trump administration for delays in widespread testing and protective equipment shortages, and argued that opening businesses too early could set back any progress made through social distancing.

California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, whose sister died from the virus, said progress cannot be made “with people competing against each other in the states” and called for stronger federal leadership.

“The question is where and when is the leadership going to come together,” she said.

Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and other Republicans criticized the select committee’s Democrats for not asking Republicans to invite a witness.

Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, D-N.Y., noted that two of the witnesses were former Food and Drug Administration commissioners under Republican presidents.

But Jordan called it an “unfair hearing” and “unfair process” and lashed out at a witness, Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, for saying one reason the economy was shut down was insufficient testing.

“Every expert on the left, right and center agrees that we had to shut down our economy because the outbreak got too big,” said Jha in response to Jordan. “The outbreak got too big because we didn’t have a testing infrastructure that allowed us to put our arms around the outbreak and so testing was the fundamental failure that forced our country to shut down.”

Experts’ suggestions

Each of the five witnesses outlined specific recommendations to safely open businesses and ease economic restrictions. All agreed on the need to increase testing in order to open up safely. Another common theme was accelerating contact tracing, in which people who had contact with infected people are identified and warned.

“Testing is the cornerstone of controlling any disease outbreak,” said Harvard’s Jha, who emphasized five steps before reopening businesses.

He said it’s necessary to get more visibility into the testing supply chain. He also said the federal government must coordinate supplies between states, offer guidance on testing strategies, provide more incentives for creating better COVID-19 tests, and be transparent about the level of testing necessary.

Mark McClellan, a former FDA commissioner and former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator who is now founding director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, also called for additional financial incentives from the federal government for better testing strategies.

Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said four conditions are necessary to minimize the spread of COVID-19: a reduction in positive cases for 14 days, the capacity to treat all COVID-19 cases with the proper standard of care, the ability to test all symptomatic individuals, and the capacity to isolate cases and trace infected people’s contacts.

Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the government should focus on four major areas: testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine.

Scott Gottlieb, former FDA Commissioner and a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said a phased introduction of reopening businesses is necessary, and agreed contact tracing and testing need to be ramped up.

“We are seeing signs of a slowing epidemic nationally but we’re still going to be reopening against the backdrop of more spread than we anticipated,” said Gottlieb. “People rightly want to know when this will be over and when they can get back to their normal lives. The reality is we may need to define a new normal.”"
Feb 24 2022,Jobless fall to historically low levels as economy brushes off omicron,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/jobless-claims-continue-to-fall-as-economy-recovers-from-pandemic,"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits fell by 17,000 last week to 232,000, an extremely low rate that suggests that employers are increasingly determined to avoid letting workers go.

Weekly jobless claims are seen as a proxy for layoffs and have been watched closely in recent weeks for indications about how COVID-19 affected the labor market. This week’s decline continues a generally downward trend in jobless claim reports since the omicron variant peaked in mid-January and comes after a surprisingly good January jobs report.

The news that layoffs are increasingly rare will buoy President Joe Biden as voters increasingly sour on his management of the economy and will also encourage the Federal Reserve to accelerate its campaign to raise interest rates in hopes of curbing inflation.

“We expect initial claims to continue to grind back toward 200k as the impact of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus fades. Layoffs are expected to be minimal in a tight labor market where employers continue to struggle to attract workers,” said economists for Oxford Economics after the report.

Jobless claims have been in a steady decline over the last year. Around this time in February 2021, new claims were averaging more than 800,000 per week. Even during the worst of the omicron uptick, which saw the most nationwide cases by far, jobless claims only ticked up slightly, showing resiliency in the U.S. recovery.

MORTGAGE RATES DROP IN EARLY SIGN OF HIGHER RATES TAKING TOLL ON MARKET

In recent weeks some cities and states have been lifting mask and vaccination mandates as a sense of normalcy returns. More businesses are also calling employees back into the office after months of remote work.

In other good news, the economy far outpaced expectations in January and added 467,000 jobs, much more than the consensus prediction of 150,000.

While the job side of the economy has been improving, one point of economic malaise is the current inflation situation. Consumer prices grew 7.5% in the year ending in January, the hottest pace in decades.

Mar 27 2020,It was the worst week for the economy in decades. The pain is just beginning.,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/it-was-worst-week-economy-decades-pain-is-just-beginning/,"The record 3.3 million jobless claims reported Thursday mark the beginning of an economic crisis facing American workers and businesses — a slump, experts say, that will only end when the coronavirus pandemic is contained. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The economy has entered a deep recession that has echoes of the Great Depression in the way it has devastated so many businesses and consumers, triggering mass layoffs and threatening to set off a chain reaction of bankruptcies and financial losses for companies large and small.

What sets this downturn apart is how rapidly the virus — and the economic pain — have spread. It remains a wide-open question whether this will become a long-lasting slump or a short-lived flash recession.

Economists say the jobless claims reported Thursday, which reflected workers seeking unemployment insurance last week, is the start of a massive spike in unemployment that could result in over 40 million Americans losing their jobs by mid-April.

Although no official figures exist yet, the unemployment rate has likely jumped to at least 5.5 percent, says economist Martha Gimbel of Schmidt Futures, a level not seen since 2015 and up from 3.5 percent in February.

“The most terrifying part about this is this is likely just the beginning of the layoffs,” Gimbel said.

That carnage is only likely to be partially ameliorated by a $2.2 trillion stimulus bill that the Senate passed late Wednesday evening and the House is aiming to approve Friday.

The bill, which gives most Americans checks worth $1,200 or more and provides billions in low-cost loans to businesses, is likely to provide a lifeline to workers and companies facing devastation, but it won’t stop a severe recession nor be adequate to sustain workers if the coronavirus health crisis lasts more than a month or two.

“We all think of a recession as having an economic underpinning, but this has nothing to do with economics. This is literally about trying to stay away from people,” said Aparna Mathur, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

Much of the nation has made the gut-wrenching choice to stop about half the economy and encourage most workers to stay home in an effort to save as many lives as possible.

LaTonua Bowens lost her job at Olive Garden in Shreveport, La., a week and a half ago. She received the call from her boss as she was coming out of Target empty-handed after an unsuccessful attempt to find toilet paper and sanitizer. Her boss told her to apply for unemployment insurance because no one knows how long it will last.

Stunned, Bowens drove to the Olive Garden parking lot where she commiserated with another laid-off cook, who had also come to the restaurant because she couldn’t believe the job losses either. They sat in their cars with their windows rolled down trying to understand how this boom-to-bust happened.

“It’s making me go into a depression,” Bowens said. “I’m worried if I’m going to still have a job. I’ve been at my job for 10 years.”

Bowens says she drove home and spent hours applying for Louisiana’s unemployment aid because the website was so slow. Newly unemployed workers across the country said in interviews it took hours, or even days, in some cases to apply last week because websites were so slow or down completely.

When she initially applied, Louisiana was still requiring people seeking jobless aid to prove they were actively searching for work, even in the pandemic. The state has now waived that requirement. Bowens and her husband, a repairman, are both out of work, but they have yet to receive any payments. Bowens just wants her old job back.

“I am not the sitting at home type person,” Bowens said. “I am not just a line cook. I do setup. Serving. Bartending. I can be the host or the ‘to go’ specialist. I have learned every job they have.”

The average unemployment benefit check is currently $385 a week, which is less than half the typical weekly paycheck in the United States. The amount is slated to rise an additional $600 a week once President Trump signs the relief bill into law, a substantial increase meant to tide workers over as they are forced to stay home.

But there is concern whether the money will arrive in time. Some states have waived the week-long waiting period before the first payment goes out, but others have not. Bowen’s husband takes nine pills a day for high blood pressure and other conditions. He is rationing them as the couple worries about stretching their finances.

Even in businesses that are considered “essential” and remain open, life has changed dramatically. Scott DeHenau, who runs an industrial packaging company called Pak-Rite in Wixom, Mich., says his firm is open because it does work for the medical and defense industries. But DeHenau almost wishes it was closed.

All employees now have their temperature tested on the way into the warehouse. He’s had lengthy discussions with each worker about whether they should take the health risk of coming to work. They now run two shifts and mandate that employees stand about 10 feet from each other. Between the shifts, they sanitize the whole facility — doorknobs, surfaces, bathrooms, tools.

Despite all this, business is down 40 percent from where it was this time last year. Some customers are canceling at the last minute. Supplies from Asia have dried up, and sometimes deliveries can’t be made from suppliers or to his customers as trucking companies don’t have enough healthy drivers or capacity.

“The covid-19 thing has really thrown a wrench in us sideways. We’re not one of those companies that has a lot of cash reserves,” DeHenau said. “We’re day by day here. It’s a lot of restless nights.”

DeHenau tried to apply for a Small Business Administration loan this week, but the site was so busy he only managed to get a login created before it froze. So far, he’s only had to lay off one of his 30 employees, but everyone is bracing for more if the situation doesn’t improve soon.

Michigan is one of 21 states that has told all nonessential employees to stay home. DeHenau’s business was founded in 1946 by his grandfather, and he doesn’t want to let the legacy down.

“The smaller the firm, the more damage this is going to cause,” said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, an audit firm that specializes in midsized companies. “What we’re hearing from smaller customers is for some of them it is too late.”

Brusuelas is also watching the commercial real estate market closely as a good indicator of whether the downturn is turning into something that will be difficult to bounce back from. The Cheesecake Factory has stopped paying rent on all its properties across the nation, and many business owners say they might do the same because government aid likely won’t arrive in time for April 1 payments. Commercial real estate stocks are down as much as 60 percent this year.

Another warning sign is companies starting to slash pay. Occidental Petroleum is cutting all U.S. worker salaries by 30 percent, and many smaller businesses say they are considering something similar, figuring it is better than layoffs. These pay reductions are another way this crisis is rapidly changing the economy’s trajectory after years of steady gains and likely making it harder for people to bounce right back to their prior spending levels, even if they kept their job.

Next week and the following week’s unemployment claims numbers are also likely to be telling. While 3.3 million new benefit applications last week was a shocking figure, it only represents a fraction of the number of people whose jobs have been cut in this flash recession so far.

Pam Massey, a hairdresser in Gig Harbor, Wash., hasn’t cut anyone’s hair since March 13. Her income has disappeared, but she has not been able to apply for her state’s unemployment benefits because she is technically self-employed. Gig workers, self-employed and people who have only worked for a few months typically aren’t eligible to get jobless aid from the government.

The Senate bill greatly expands who can receive benefits to include self-employed workers like Massey, but she has already lost half a month of income and she has to wait for the House to pass the bill and her state to implement the change.

“I worried about my mortgage. I’m trying to get ready for retirement. This is going to kill it,” Massey said. “But if we don’t stop the virus now, it will continue for God only knows how long. Let’s take the suffering upfront.”

Trump has debated trying to reopen parts of the country by Easter, but economists and health experts fear that could cause more loss of life and even end up prolonging the recession if coronavirus cases spike again.

In his first appearance on morning television Thursday, Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome H. Powell told NBC’s “Today” show that the nation “may well be in a recession” already, but making the country safe has to be the top concern.

“The first order of business is to get the virus under control and then resume economic activity,"" he said."

“If I had to bet, I’d say that this might be one of the worst downturns that we’ve seen in recent history,” Zuckerberg told his staff during a weekly session, the audio of which was obtained by Reuters. Meta reportedly planned to hire roughly 10,000 new engineers throughout the year, but has cut this expectation down to 6,000-7,000, Zuckerberg announced in the audio.

Americans Aren’t Buying Biden’s Tale Of Economic Recovery https://t.co/jOZJmn48A3 — Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) April 28, 2022

The company will be leaving several positions unfilled and will be “turning up the heat” on performance management in an attempt to get rid of staffers unable to meet goals, Reuters continued. “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Zuckerberg continued, the outlet reported.

“Part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might decide that this place isn’t for you, and that self-selection is OK with me,” Zuckerberg told his teams. Chief Product Officer Chris Cox concurred with Zuckerberg’s sentiment, according to Reuters. (RELATED: A Host Of Cartoonish Bond Villains Are Deciding Your Fate From The Swiss Alps)

“I have to underscore that we are in serious times here and the headwinds are fierce. We need to execute flawlessly in an environment of slower growth, where teams should not expect vast influxes of new engineers and budgets,” Cox wrote in a memo, also obtained by Reuters.

Facebook has reportedly lost $500 billion since rebranding to Meta, according to PC Gamer. With more and more financial experts noting the impending recession, Meta has already confirmed hiring pauses, but the new information from Thursday’s meeting is the first time exact figures have been released."
Jan 20 2022,A ‘Biden boom’? Inflation makes economy feel like a bust to many.,Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2022/0120/A-Biden-boom-Inflation-makes-economy-feel-like-a-bust-to-many,"In 2021, the U.S. consumer price index rose 7%, the highest 12-month increase since 1982. Average hourly earnings rose only 4.7%. Thus, a solid pay raise (evidence of a Biden boom) is actually more than a 2% pay cut once adjusted for inflation (a sticker-shock bust).

Fed officials spent most of last year arguing that inflation was “transitory” and the result of the pandemic. They now have dropped the term and are signaling a tougher stance.

Sometimes a strong economy depends on context, and while economic growth is up, so is inflation. That’s causing a shift in perspective from the White House to a lot of other houses.

When untamed, inflation can threaten economic growth by eroding consumer and business confidence – and damaging household spending power. And if Americans expect ​it to be lasting, they will make purchasing decisions that exacerbate inflation and complicate efforts by Federal Reserve policymakers to control it.​

By most measures, from jobs or wages to GDP, the economy did very well in 2021. But surging prices have undercut what the administration and some others have dubbed a “Biden boom.” The issue is important for ​reasons that go well beyond politics.

It’s the kind of record any president would envy. Economic growth in 2021 is forecast to have reached a 38-year high. Jobs are being added at a historic pace. The administration – and some others – are calling it the “Biden boom.”

But the American public is skeptical. After one year in office, President Joe Biden’s approval rating is slipping to lows that Donald Trump experienced for most of his presidency.

A key reason? Inflation is also on a tear and is beginning to undercut the otherwise thriving economy that Mr. Biden inherited. The damage is minimal so far, but the trends are ominous for Democrats. The Federal Reserve is likely to begin throttling back growth just as voters begin to make up their minds about the direction of the economy. When they go to the polls this November to vote for members of Congress, will they perceive a Biden boom or a sticker-shock bust?

Why We Wrote This Sometimes a strong economy depends on context, and while economic growth is up, so is inflation. That’s causing a shift in perspective from the White House to a lot of other houses.

Rising prices are important for ​reasons that go well beyond politics. When untamed, inflation itself can threaten economic growth by eroding consumer and business confidence – and damaging household finances as prices surge faster than incomes. And if Americans expect ​it to be lasting, they will make purchasing decisions that exacerbate inflation and complicate the Fed’s efforts to control it.​

“The Fed is behind the curve,” says Frederic Mishkin, an economist at Columbia Business School and former Fed governor. “They are going to have to tighten more than they otherwise would.”

To counteract inflation, central bankers typically “tighten” monetary conditions – by raising interest rates, for example. However, those actions can cool demand and slow the economy, often resulting in a recession. And if there’s one thing voters like even less than inflation, it’s slow or negative economic growth, research shows.

Nam Y. Huh/AP/File View caption Hide caption A hiring sign is seen outside an employment agency in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, on Dec. 3, 2021. The year was one of the fastest for job creation in U.S. history. Unemployment is low and wages are growing. Yet rising prices have shaken consumers – contributing to a fall in indexes of their economic confidence.

This is what scares Democrats. Heading into midterm elections where their prospects for holding onto the House and Senate already look shaky, they don’t want to get saddled with high inflation or a weak economy. At his first solo press conference in 10 months, Mr. Biden on Wednesday acknowledged that inflation was bad: “People see it at the gas pumps, the grocery stores, and elsewhere.” And he endorsed efforts to fight the surge in prices, pointing out that it was the Fed’s responsibility.

Inflation rises on the worry list

The surge in prices is undeniable. Inflation last month rose at an annual rate of 7%, the highest 12-month increase since 1982, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Even using “core inflation” measures, which strip away sectors where prices can swing widely, the price surge is ratcheting up.

And its effects are beginning to be felt. Average hourly earnings rose by a strong 4.7% for 2021, but that turns out to be more than a 2% pay cut once adjusted for inflation. An index of consumer sentiment is lower now than during a spring 2020 dip as the pandemic began.

The Biden administration pins the blame on the pandemic and says supply chain issues will get worked out over time and inflation will then abate.

“Given that it is a supply-demand mismatch that really is a result of the pandemic, the reason ... forecasters are expecting that inflation will ease is we do expect that this pandemic will moderate,” Cecilia Rouse, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in an online symposium with the Council on Foreign Relations last week.

That argument becomes harder to make the longer high inflation persists. In a Conference Board survey of U.S. CEOs released last week, inflation was the No. 2 external challenge after labor shortages; a year ago, it barely registered on CEOs’ radar at No. 22. Even Federal Reserve policymakers, who spent most of last year agreeing with the administration that inflation was transitory, have dropped the term and are signaling a tougher stance.

Did federal stimulus play a role?

Conservatives point to another major culprit for inflation: federal spending. Many economists applauded the initial $2 trillion pandemic relief act that President Trump signed in early 2020 for containing the economic damage after government-mandated shutdowns. But subsequent Trump spending measures poured another $2.8 trillion into the economy, followed by $2.7 trillion in Biden initiatives, with promises to spend even more. That money has pumped up demand.

“To this day, [Democrats and their supporters] blame the inflation on supply-chain problems and the usual suspects: big business, insufficient antitrust enforcement and greedy profiteers,” write former Senate Banking Committee Chairman Phil Gramm and Mike Solon of US Policy Metrics, an economic and public policy research firm in Washington, in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal. “They never blame government.”

Inflation is not uniformly bad. Like other economic changes, it creates winners as well as losers. Homeowners see the value of their homes go up and the burden of fixed-rate mortgages go down. Renters, by contrast, see only rising rents. A recent Bank of America study found that lower-income and less-educated households save less and are spending a greater percentage of their incomes on high-inflation goods, such as energy, food, and cars and trucks, than higher-income and more-educated households are. The inflation surge has cut the spending of households where no one holds a college degree by 4.6% versus only 3.0% for those with a college degree.

Forecasting when inflation falls is difficult, even without the complications of a pandemic. The latest survey of professional forecasters, released in November, called for the consumer price index to drop back to a 2.5% or lower annual rate of growth in the second half of this year. Now, some forecasters see the Fed imposing three quarter-point increases this year in the federal funds rate, which the central bank typically uses to influence short-term interest rates.

Even with those moves, the federal funds rate would still be below a percentage point, hardly an aggressive tightening, points out Laurence Ball, an economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

If the pandemic ends over the course of this year, it’s still reasonable to expect inflation to slow and the economy to bounce back without drastic action from the Fed, he adds. But “I’m in the group of people that has been somewhat chastened. I wrote things early last year that this [inflation] thing would be gone pretty soon, and that hasn’t been the case.”"

Dec 30 2019,'Big Kahuna' economy positions Trump for victory in 2020,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/big-kahuna-economy-positions-trump-for-victory-in-2020,"A humming economy, rising wages, promises kept, and forecasts that economic growth will continue have Republican pollsters saying President Trump is well-placed for reelection.

“Among presidents running for reelection since 1912, twelve of them in the two years running for reelection did not have a recession. All twelve were reelected,” Public Opinion Strategies’ Glen Bolger said. Based on current numbers, “you could not ask for a better kickoff for a presidential reelection campaign,” said Bill McInturff, also of Public Opinion Strategies. Bolger and McInturff are both GOP pollsters.

Looking at the data, contrary to expectations, impeachment has yet to move the needle, said Bolger. Both national polls and those from battleground states have improved for Trump in recent weeks.

But veteran Republican political operative and President George W. Bush political svengali Karl Rove suggested that Trump’s victory is hardly a lock.

“It could come down to a handful of states, and as in 2016, a relatively small number of votes, and could potentially blow wide open,” Rove told the Washington Examiner. “But, I think that depends on who the Democrats nominate, how extreme are they, and how effective is the president at making the case that they are out of the mainstream.”

Rove said Trump’s campaign is covering its bases. “The best news for him is that his team is not taking it for granted,” Rove said. “They are not resting on the Ray Fair model that says the economy is so good that we are going to win easy. They recognize that these are unusual times, the country is deeply polarized, and the Democrats are energized.”

A key test, Rove said, will be the president’s State of the Union address and the weeks leading into it as he lays out his next act. “His political team has a realistic view. They understand they are in for a real battle. That matters, because the way that you lose as an incumbent is by thinking, ‘I’ve done a good job, and the people are going to reward me.’ Voters do not reward first-term presidents simply for doing a good job,” Rove said.

Republicans and Democrats have touted their work on the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal, but according to Bolger, a more significant indicator is how people feel about foreign trade in general. If the economy remains as strong as it is, even if they dislike the deal, they may regard it more favorably.

“The economy is the Big Kahuna,” Bolger said, but there are other matters voters will consider as well. “Persuadable voters, swing voters are going to weigh the state of the economy, how they feel about the president personally, how they think he’s doing with foreign affairs — in terms of, ‘Is the world generally at peace or are there major problems?’ Many factors could come into play.”

Trump’s base, meanwhile, sees him trying to deliver on promises made during the 2016 campaign.

In 2016, Trump promised to stack federal and district court benches, a priority for evangelical voters, and has appointed — and the Senate confirmed — nearly 200 federal judges.

The president has also rung up a score of other achievements certain to drive his base to the polls, including renegotiating NAFTA, which became the newly passed U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, enacting tax reform, strongly supporting Israel, rebuilding the military, and at least attempting to curtail illegal immigration while starting to build the border wall.

Bolger agrees with Rove that the race could be close and that who Democrats nominate will play a significant role.

According to one source close to the White House, the reason candidate Biden is a “little more formidable for Trump than some of the others” comes down to groups that Trump needs to recapture to win reelection — namely seniors, conservative minorities, and white working-class voters, all constituencies that, according to polling, are interested only in Biden among Democrats.

Arizona is another issue for Trump, according to this source. “They see him as brash, preferring a Mitt Romney-type Republican to a Donald Trump-type Republican.” Arizona’s large Mormon population has used the ballot box to voice objections to anti-immigrant rhetoric in the past."
Jan 19 2022,"How expanded child tax credit aided these moms, changed economy",Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2022/0119/How-expanded-child-tax-credit-aided-these-moms-changed-economy?icid=rss,"Javona Brownlee, a single mother of three in Fairfax, Virginia, says the $850 a month for her made “a big difference.” Now she’s hoping to supplement her cleaning business by finding a part-time job elsewhere, which, until last month, she had been doing with a job at a hotel.

She and other researchers say the credit acted more as a cushion against instability than as a disincentive to work.

“It was reducing child poverty. It was reducing food insufficiency. It was increasing families’ ability to meet their basic needs,” says Megan Curran, policy director at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.

Many social welfare programs target specific forms of assistance for specific groups. The expanded child tax credit last year became a test of a different model: cash assistance for families, with no strings attached.

The idea, however, may live on as a model that could be revived or adapted. In effect, the tax credit was recast as more of a child allowance than a tax refund – so it puts cash even in the hands of the poorest households that owe no federal income tax.

Last year, federal pandemic relief included an expansion of the tax code’s child credit – cutting child poverty by 29.4%, by one estimate. Now legions of families are adapting to life without the monthly deposits or checks, as President Joe Biden has been unsuccessful in getting Congress to renew it.

Over the summer, Danette Mahabeer had a problem familiar to most parents at one point or another: Her daughter, Soheila, was “sprouting,” Ms. Mahabeer says. “Growing out of everything she owned.”

Clothes that fit were suddenly tight. So was money. As for food, Sohelia was ravenous.

For Ms. Mahabeer, a single mother in Nashville, Tennessee, increased costs for food and clothing for a growing child posed real financial challenges. But from June to December, like clockwork, $300 appeared in her bank account. The Biden administration almost certainly hadn’t anticipated Soheila’s penchant for eating Cap’n Crunch multiple times a day – both as breakfast and an afternoon snack – but the checks were earmarked for those exact kinds of child-rearing expenses.

Why We Wrote This Many social welfare programs target specific forms of assistance for specific groups. The expanded child tax credit last year became a test of a different model: cash assistance for families, with no strings attached.

The money came from the expansion to the federal child tax credit – a signature Biden initiative that is now expiring despite what many policy experts see as promising results in easing financial strains on U.S. families.

Since its 1997 inception, the child tax credit has aimed to give America’s families a boost through the tax code. But the expansion last year dramatically enlarged that goal, recasting the program as more of a child allowance than a tax refund – so it puts cash even in the hands of the poorest households that owe no federal income tax.

As part of a pandemic relief bill, the revised credit also boosted the maximum amount of money each family could receive to as much as $3,600 per child, up from $2,000 per child before. And the payments began flowing out in monthly deposits or checks, rather than as an annual lump sum when taxes are filed.

Taken together, the changes were costly but also slashed poverty and pioneered the concept of widespread cash payments to working-age households as a potential centerpiece of federal social welfare policy – letting households choose where the money is most needed.

“It was reducing child poverty. It was reducing food insufficiency. It was increasing families’ ability to meet their basic needs,” says Megan Curran, policy director at Columbia University’s Center on Poverty and Social Policy.

The payments helped reduce child poverty by 29.4%, keeping 3.8 million children from slipping into poverty in November alone, according to the center’s estimates. Those effects will now be running in reverse.

Nick Roll View caption Hide caption Danette Mahabeer poses for a photo in Nashville, Tennessee, on Jan. 14, 2021. Ms. Mahabeer was receiving $300 a month under the expanded child tax credit, which she used for clothing and food for her daughter. Ms. Mahabeer, who runs a photo studio and is a certified life coach, is now turning to side jobs to make up for the expiration of those payments.

The expansion was only good for 2021. A renewal was included in President Joe Biden’s wide-ranging domestic spending bill, known as Build Back Better, which has failed to pass Congress. Payments that were arriving in the middle of every month from June to December have stopped materializing. Jan. 15 came and went like any other day.

Some higher-income families, whose more solid monthly earnings mean they didn’t qualify for the full benefit, probably won’t notice an odd $150 or so missing from their books each month. Those earning up to $150,000 could still qualify for the full credit. But for legions of others, the cash – up to $300 per child under age 6 and up to $250 for other children under 18 – was a lifeline, and family budgets are being redrawn.

“Working myself to the bone”

Javona Brownlee was receiving $850 a month until payments stopped – “a big difference,” says the Fairfax, Virginia, mother of three. The money went toward car payments, groceries, bills, and gas. “And sometimes I would use it for a night out with the kids – maybe a movie theater, a dinner, depending on if I had it to spare,” she says. “I needed it more for important things – bills – than fun.”

Without the money, Ms. Brownlee is already planning on how to cut back. She plans to hold onto her car for as long as she can, and then have it repossessed – voluntarily, she hopes, if she can stretch out her finances until tax time, when she hopes to downgrade to a used car she can buy outright.

She’s hoping to find a new part-time job, after having part-time work at a hotel recently.

“I’m back to working myself to the bone,” on top of caring for her three elementary school-aged children, says Ms. Brownlee, who runs a cleaning business. She’s hoping to supplement her income by finding a part-time job elsewhere, which, until last month, she had been doing with a job at a hotel.

“When we were receiving [the payments] it provided security. I was looking forward to receiving that payment every 15th,” says Ms. Brownlee, who is living in a shelter after her condo developed a mold problem in November. “It wasn’t something that I had to go and pick up an 11-hour shift, or 12 hours. It was something that allowed me to spend time with my kids. ... I’m really, really sad, and I hate to see it go.”

A move toward a child allowance?

There have long been both liberal and conservative arguments for child allowances – sometimes as an alternative to universal child care – including recent legislation from Republican Sen. Mitt Romney.

In a Morning Consult poll in December, 44% of registered voters who got the credit said it had a “major impact” on their finances. Another 41% said the credit had at least a “minor impact” for them.

Still, despite its theoretically bipartisan appeal, the child tax credit expansion failed to win clear majority support from the public over its short lifespan. In the December poll, 47% of respondents supported extending the program, while 42% were opposed. Some critics – like Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, whose opposition to Build Back Better killed its chances of passing – questioned the cost of the program. Mr. Manchin also voiced skepticism around giving out unconditional money, especially without work requirements.

“I have been guilty of that [line of thought], to some extent,” says Sunnie Johnson-Lain, senior director of services at the Cincinnati branch of the Society of St. Vincent DePaul, a nonprofit. Yet Ms. Johnson-Lain points out that the organization saw a drop in requests for services when stimulus checks went out. A similar trend held with monthly child tax credit payments: Typically, half of the households coming to the charity’s food pantry didn’t have children, while half did. Over the period when monthly payments were going out, those numbers shifted to a 55-45, or even 60-40 split at times, which Ms. Johnson-Lain calls “significant.” Research from Columbia found that families spent the money “first and foremost” on food.

Other critics have worried about the economy, with some projections showing the payments could dissuade people from pursuing work – thus dampening, though not completely erasing, the tax credit’s overall effect on fighting poverty. But a number of researchers say effects on labor supply are modest to negligible, with the credit providing a cushion against instability rather than a disincentive to work.

“Once you get to real-world data,” argues Ms. Curran at Columbia, “basically there’s been no evidence that shows any sort of employment effects.”

“Back to the basics”

Maria Kraemer holds down two jobs, one as a home health aide and another working at a company that produces parts for fire safety equipment. Yet inconsistent hours mean the Cincinnati single mother’s aspirations are difficult to reach. Payments from the tax credit, however – to the tune of $250 a month – changed things for her and her son, Charlie.

Ms. Kraemer is caught up on her bills. She set aside money in a savings account for the 11-year-old, a first. The rest of the money typically went to food and his school tuition – and sometimes “extracurriculars,” like a trip to the movies, with popcorn.

“That money helped free up other money that I could [then] use, instead of paying directly for hospital bills or medicine,” Ms. Kraemer says. Neither she nor Charlie has health insurance.

The ending of the program won’t ruin her finances, she says, “but now it’s back to the basics.”

In Nashville, Ms. Mahabeer, who runs a photo studio and is a certified life coach, has turned to side jobs to make up for the $300 monthly payments – nannying, teaching Zumba lessons, driving for Uber and Lyft.

“Spontaneous things to help to cushion those costs, because those costs are still here,” she says. She made things work before the monthly payments. But they gave her a leg up, and showed her new possibilities. “I’ve kind of gotten into that zone where that extra $300 was coming in.”

Now, she’s doing “anything to bring that extra income in on top of what I already make, so that I can still comfortably provide for my child.”"

Jan 02 2020,The big things we learned about the economy in 2019,Jeff Spross,left,https://theweek.com/articles/886676/big-things-learned-about-economy-2019,"Today, of course, is New Years Day. For a lot of folks, it's a day of renewal and recommitment, of looking forward to the coming year and resolving to do things better. With that hope comes hard work: namely, looking over the previous year and reckoning with the mistakes you made and what you can learn from them.

What's true of individuals is also true of governments, leadership, and economic policymakers.

Granted, 2019 was not the most dramatic year of the past decade. Wages, growth, and livelihoods are not doing as well as some headline figures suggest, but they're doing much better now than they were at the start of the 2010s.

Still, in the world of business and economics, some big stuff did happen in 2019, which shed light on assumptions and policies and ways of doing things that need to change. If we want 2020 to be better, here are some lessons everyone should heed:

1. We have no idea where full employment is.

In macroeconomic policymaking, few questions are more central than how hot we can run the economy. This question looms particularly large for the Federal Reserve, which adjusts interest rates to strike the balance between stable prices and maximum employment. To that end, the Fed began hiking interest rates in 2016, despite the fact that inflation was nowhere in sight. The fear was that if the central bank didn't anticipate inflation, it would be too late to control once it took off. Yet unemployment just kept falling, and prices haven't so much as twitched. Meanwhile, other metrics suggest the economy is a lot further from full capacity than policymakers believed.

In January 2019, the Fed cried uncle and began cutting rates again — an almost unprecedented decision, given the state of the economy. It was a tacit admission of the obvious: No one has any idea where full capacity actually lies. All our predictions have been bunk. ""We can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said recently. ""To call it hot, you'd want to see heat.""

2. Lots of rich geniuses aren't all that smart.

Initially regarded as something between an entrepreneurial genius and a new age guru, Adam Neumann was the CEO of WeWork. He convinced Masayoshi Son, a freewheeling Japanese investor, to sink $9 billion into the venture, and WeWork was headed for a $47 billion valuation. But WeWork's basic rent-a-workspace business model, while perfectly reasonable, made no sense as a $47 billion innovation. In 2019, investors caught on, the IPO fell apart, and Neumann was pushed out as CEO.

It was a particularly dramatic example of how a lot of Silicon Valley wonder companies are fads and regulatory arbitrages, run by mediocrities. It also showed how business leaders often warp corporate governance to turn companies into their own personal ATMs — investors had to pay the former CEO $1 billion just to make him go away. The next time someone says we need billionaires because they’re experts at productively directing economic activity, remind them of Neumann.

3. Private businesses aren't good at self-policing.

Closely related to the idea that we need billionaires is another line of thought: that government is inefficient, and the best government is that which governs least. One consequence of this philosophy has been a hollowing out of congressional staff and institutional expertise, leaving government effectively unable to think for itself. Legislating and regulating have increasingly been taken over by lobbyists and private business powers.

One particular example of this was a 2003 decision by Congress to have the Federal Aviation Administration allow employees at aerospace companies to essentially conduct much of the agency's oversight for it. This practice came back to bite everyone in 2019. Pressed for time and profits, Boeing slapped together its new 737 Max with an inadequate design and jury-rigged software. The result was two crashes, which killed 346 people. The plane was grounded in March 2019. As of now, Boeing's CEO is toast, recriminations are flying within the FAA and Congress, and no one has any idea when or if the 737 Max will fly again.

4. The Trump administration's economic policy still isn't working.

The GOP's tax cuts may have passed back in 2017, but it's worth keeping continued tabs on the results, given the enthusiasm with which many policymakers insist that giving rich people ever bigger profits is the best way to grow jobs and wages. In 2019, the tax cuts continued to be a complete dud: no discernible effect on business investment, on wages, or on employment.

The same goes for Trump's trade war. Granted, the president is right to denounce the global trade order as a mess. But his tit-for-tat tariffs have proven to be a feeble and confused strategy, doing as much harm as good for America's economic prospects. The wins in the new North American trade deal look modest at best. Trump's critics may err in blaming everything wrong in the economy on the tariffs. But the best that can be said of Trump's trade war is it has accomplished nothing of significance.

5. The minimum wage, however, is working.

Mainstream economics has long considered the minimum wage to be a job killer. But over the last decade or so, a building literature has challenged that consensus. Experts in the field delivered several big syntheses of this new research in 2019, demonstrating that minimum wage hikes generally have no significant effect on employment. There are multiple reasons for this, ranging from the new spending that enters the economy due to higher wages, higher labor costs forcing businesses to be more productive, and how monopsony power in labor markets can allow businesses to artificially depress worker pay.

This year's studies were particularly noteworthy because they covered previous natural experiments in minimum wage hikes that were as aggressive as the $15-an-hour minimum wages U.S. states and cities are currently passing. The point isn't infinitely elastic, of course: At some high-enough level, minimum wages will become destructive on net. But as with full capacity in the economy, it's time to admit we have no idea where that threshold is."

According to a new Fox News poll, 59 percent of Americans believe the economy has somewhat improved, but believe it still has a long way to go.

The 59 percent of voters who think the economy is hurting includes 22 percent who say the country is still in recession and 37 percent who say it’s in an economic downturn, but not a recession. The 59 percent of voters who think the economy is hurting includes 22 percent who say the country is still in recession and 37 percent who say it’s in an economic downturn, but not a recession.



The silver lining is that’s a significant improvement over the 67 percent who felt the economy was in bad shape a year ago. And it’s light years away from three years ago when 83 percent felt that way (41 percent recession and 42 percent downturn, 2012).



A record high (though still lackluster) 38 percent think the economy is doing okay, up from 30 percent a year ago.



Although the unemployment rate is down, it should be noted there are a record number of people who aren't participating in the labor force."
Apr 12 2021,Powell tells '60 Minutes' that US economy is at an 'inflection point',CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/11/economy/jerome-powell-federal-reserve-60-minutes/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the US economy is at an “inflection point,” and that growth and job creation is poised to accelerate.

Powell made the comments during an interview on CBS News’ “60 Minutes.” In the interview, Powell provided a rosier economic outlook, in contrast to past remarks on the economy’s recovery.

“What we’re seeing now is really an economy that seems to be much at an inflection point,” Powell told “60 minutes” during the interview. “And that’s because of widespread vaccination and strong fiscal support, strong monetary policy support. We feel like we’re at a place where the economy’s about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly. The outlook has brightened substantially.”

But that’s only if there isn’t another wave of Covid-19.

“The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again. It’s going to be smart if people can continue to socially distance and wear masks,” he told “60 Minutes.”

More than 183 million vaccines have been administered in the United States, according to CDC data.

This comes after minutes released from the central bank last week underscored that it would be some time “until substantial further progress” was made on employment and inflation. The Fed slashed interest rates to zero in March 2020 and said it expects to keep interest rates at historically low levels into 2023.

“We did not know how the economy would perform. We did not know the path of the disease,” Powell said in the “60 Minutes” interview. “We had no idea when and how long it would take to do a vaccine.”

When probed if he expected the current economic downturn to mirror anything like the 2008 financial crisis, Powell said that the chances are “very low.” Instead, Powell mentioned “cyber risk” being the main concern, citing examples of large firms losing the ability to track payments its disbursing.

“We spend so much time and energy and money guarding against these things. There are cyber-attacks every day on all major institutions now,” he told “60 Minutes.” “That’s a big part of the threat picture in today’s world.”

Last month, Powell said that any increases in inflation over the summer months would be temporary and not concerning for its monetary policy at this moment. During his interview with “60 Minutes”, Powell reiterated that past economic cycles showed that inflation didn’t increase much as unemployment went down.

“That means that we can afford to wait to see actual inflation appear before we raise interest rates,” he said. Powell added that the Fed wants inflation to move up above 2% “on a sustainable basis” before it decides to raise interest rates.

“We do have the ability to wait to see real inflation, and that’s what we plan on doing,” Powell said in the interview."

Apr 06 2021,California aims to fully reopen its economy June 15,Los Angeles Times,left,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-06/california-aims-to-fully-reopen-the-economy-june-15,"Sawyer Livsey, visiting from San Francisco with his family, bowls at Bowlero Los Angeles bowling alley in Westchester which reopened on Tuesday.

California is aiming to fully reopen its economy June 15, more than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic upended the lives and businesses of millions across the state.

Officials emphasize the move hinges on two factors: a sufficient vaccine supply and stable and low hospitalization numbers.

There also will not be a full return to pre-pandemic life. Notably, California’s mask mandate will remain in place.

But officials expressed confidence that the state, through continued improvement in its coronavirus metrics and the steady rollout of vaccines, is now positioned to begin actively planning for what comes after COVID-19.

“With the expectation of an abundance of doses coming in from the federal government through the end of this month and into May, we can confidently say by June 15 that we can start to open up as business as usual — subject to ongoing mask wearing and ongoing vigilance,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a news conference in San Francisco on Tuesday.

“So this is a big day.”

June 15 is expected to be the end of California’s current reopening roadmap, which sorts counties into one of four color-coded tiers based on three metrics: coronavirus case rates, adjusted based on the number of tests performed; the rate of positive test results; and a health-equity metric intended to ensure that the positive test rate in poorer communities is not significantly higher than the county’s overall figure.

“The entire state will move into this phase as a whole. This will not be county-by-county,” Dr. Mark Ghaly, California’s health and human services secretary, said in a call with reporters.

In a statement, officials said those sectors included in the state’s reopening blueprint will be allowed to “return to usual operations in compliance with Cal/OSHA requirements and with common-sense public health policies in place, such as required masking, testing and with vaccinations encouraged. Large-scale indoor events, such as conventions, will be allowed to occur with testing or vaccination verification requirements.”

Ghaly emphasized that, “if we see any concerning rise in our hospitalizations, we will take the necessary precautions. But right now, we are hopeful in what we’re seeing as we continue to build on the 20 million vaccines already administered.”

Though state officials said they will keep a watchful eye on vaccine supply and hospitalizations — including how many fully vaccinated people end up requiring that level of care — they did not establish any hard benchmarks to determine whether California is ready to progress.

“We don’t have a specific number, per se, on the hospitalizations, but are looking at impacts on hospital capacity and the delivery systems’ ability to continue to deliver routine care,” Ghaly said.

On Monday, 1,989 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized in California — with 493 of them in intensive care. The state hasn’t seen numbers that low since last spring.

Part of the reason June 15 was chosen as the target date, Ghaly said, was that it falls two months after the state will extend vaccine eligibility to anyone 16 and older.

“We wanted to be able to provide at least a couple of weeks, two to three weeks, for individuals interested in getting vaccinated who suddenly become eligible on April 15 to get in line to get their vaccines started,” he said.

The timeline for full vaccination depends on what type of shot is administered. Ghaly noted that the longest time frame is associated with the Moderna vaccine — which has a four-week gap between first and second doses.

Health officials consider someone to be fully vaccinated two weeks after they receive their final dose.

To date, providers throughout California have administered 20.3 million total COVID-19 vaccine doses, and 34.2% of residents have received at least one shot, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Roughly 18.1% of Californians are fully vaccinated.

Nationwide, 32.4% of Americans have received at least one dose, and 18.8% are fully vaccinated, CDC data show.

Along with progress on the vaccine front, officials noted that California has one of the lowest coronavirus case rates in the nation — a welcome development as other areas of the country contend with new spikes of the illness.

According to data from the CDC, California’s latest seven-day new case rate of 45.5 per 100,000 people per day is the fourth-lowest among all states and significantly below the nationwide rate of 133.8.

Climbing case rates have been seen in Michigan with 471 per 100,000 people; New Jersey, 335; New York City, 307.7; the rest of New York state, 248.7 and Pennsylvania, 235.4.

Among larger states, the comparable rates over the same time period were 171.7 in Florida and 62.3 in Texas.

However, Newsom acknowledged that California could have to reapply restrictions if variants of the virus cause cases to significantly increase.

“This is really a race, these vaccines against the variants, against the mutations,” he said.

But with continued masking and safety precautions, the governor said he doesn’t anticipate California will reverse course.

“We’re always going to be led by data, led by reality and the lived experience on the ground,” Newsom said. “But our expectation is, if we’re vigilant, if we don’t spike the ball, if we don’t announce mission accomplished, and continue to do the good work that we’ve done, that by June 15, we’ll be beyond that blueprint and we’ll be back to a sense of normalcy.”

California ‘Double mutant’ coronavirus variant is found in California The existence of a coronavirus variant containing two worrisome mutations, first discovered in India two weeks ago, is confirmed in California.

A successful statewide reopening in June confers a major political upside for the governor, who faces a likely recall election in the fall.

Newsom’s chances of surviving a recall could be higher if Californians have resumed some form of pre-COVID-19 life when they cast their ballots. Mass vaccinations and the return of in-person education are critical to that sense of normality.

Newsom was the first governor in the nation to issue a stay-at-home order in the early days of the pandemic last year, an action widely cast as the right call to protect California’s fragile healthcare system.

The governor hasn’t received the same praise for his handling of reopenings.

Health experts have said Newsom lifted restrictions too quickly and didn’t reinstate them fast enough when case numbers grew, adding to COVID-19 surges in the summer and winter. Ghaly, one of the state’s top health officials, has said he would have slowed the pace of change last summer if he could do it all again.

Rescinding restrictions and launching a sweeping reopening create new risks for Newsom. If the virus surges again or unexpected problems arise, the whiplash of the governor’s constantly changing rules could be fresher in the minds of voters, who may blame him at the polls.

Political experts say the more Californians think of the pandemic in the past tense, the more likely Newsom is to keep his seat.

California Facing recall, Newsom’s political future is tied to California vaccine effort Gov. Gavin Newsom’s political survival hinges on how Californians feel about their lives and their governor in the fall when they will probably cast their ballots. And already, voters are more confident about the future — and Newsom — as vaccinations increase in the state and more people begin to envision a return to normal life.

The announcement of the targeted reopening date came the same day that California hit its goal of administering 4 million COVID-19 vaccine doses in its most vulnerable communities — a milestone not only in the ongoing struggle to more equitably give out the precious shots, but in the push to further reopen the state’s economy, even ahead of June 15.

Upon hitting the target, the state redrafted its reopening roadmap to implement new criteria allowing counties to more quickly relax some of the restrictions on businesses and public spaces.

The tiers outlined in California’s current reopening strategy go from purple, in which coronavirus transmission is considered widespread, and indoor business operations are severely limited; to red, with fewer restrictions; to orange, with even fewer; and finally, yellow, in which most businesses can open indoors with modifications.

Before Tuesday, counties had to record fewer than 4.0 new cases per day per 100,000 people to move into the orange tier. With the 4-million dose target now achieved, the requirement has been loosened to under 6.0.

Under the new criteria, 15 counties — Contra Costa, El Dorado, Humboldt, Imperial, Mendocino, Monterey, Napa, Riverside, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Diego, Siskiyou, Sonoma, Tulare and Ventura — officially moved from the red to orange tier this week.

San Joaquin County escaped the purple tier, leaving only two counties, Inyo and Merced, still subject to the state’s strictest COVID-19 rules.

Even though the state also relaxed the criteria for reaching the most lenient yellow tier — to an adjusted daily new case rate of below 2 per 100,000 people, up from the previous requirement of less than 1 — only two counties, Alpine and Sierra, have made it that far.

All told, 32 of California’s 58 counties, representing roughly 80% of the state’s population, are now in the orange tier; and 22, home to nearly 19% of Californians, are in the red tier.

Moving into the orange tier has significant economic implications — though counties can always opt to maintain stricter rules in place, if they choose.

Counties can allow bars, which no longer are required to serve food, to reopen outdoors with some modifications.

Amusement parks can reopen at up to 25% capacity, and fan attendance is allowed at 33% capacity for outdoor sports and live performances.

Bowling alleys, card rooms and satellite wagering sites also can reopen, each at 25% capacity and with certain modifications.

Capacity restrictions can also be lifted in stores, although social distancing and other safety modifications still apply. Accommodations can also be increased at houses of worship, museums, zoos and aquariums; restaurants and movie theaters; and indoor gyms and yoga studios.

Offices in nonessential industries can reopen, though the state says workers should still be encouraged to work remotely.

The state-set goal of administering first 2 million, then 4 million doses in targeted communities — namely, those in the lowest quartile of a socioeconomic measurement tool called the California Healthy Places Index — is one aspect of a wider effort aimed at ensuring equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

California has for the last month earmarked 40% of its COVID-19 vaccine supply for residents in those disadvantaged areas, an allocation state officials said would not only help address inequities in the inoculation rollout, but make sure the shots are available to those most at risk from the pandemic."

AP-GfK finds growing optimism about the economy and the president. A new NH poll continues to show a competitive GOP field. And CQ Researcher dives deep into the state of political polling. This is HuffPollster for Monday, February 9, 2015.

GROWING APPROVAL FOR ECONOMY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA - Emily Swanson: ""Americans' views of President Barack Obama have improved slightly in the past two months, and opinions are more positive about the direction of the country and the health of the economy, an Associated Press-GfK poll finds... Forty-seven percent of those surveyed approve of how Obama is doing his job, compared with 41 percent in December, and 51 percent approve of his handling of unemployment, compared with 44 percent before. Nearly half say the economy is good now, while 41 percent thought that in December. In December 2013, only one-third called the economy good. Approval of the way Obama is handling the economy improved slightly, 41 percent to 45 percent, over the past two months…But people still feel that their own recovery is lagging, the poll shows, with only 35 percent saying their own family has completely or mostly recovered from economic downturn. Just 27 percent see the job market where they live as being most of the way to recovery, far less than the number that thinks big businesses (55 percent) and the stock market (53 percent) have bounced all the way back. In spite of growing optimism about politics and the economy, 8 in 10 people questioned have little confidence that Obama and Republicans in Congress can work together to solve the country's problems.""

How high is the ceiling on Obama's approval? - David Lauter: ""President Obama's standing with the public likely will continue its recent upward trend following the latest positive economic news, but new data on the country's polarized politics suggests he'll soon bump up against a low ceiling. The labor market data released by the federal government on Friday showed the best three months of job growth since the mid-1990s, an increase in the percentage of Americans who are working and the first signs of wage growth. That's the kind of good news that usually sends presidential approval ratings upward. But political polarization exerts a powerful pull in the other direction: Much like President George W. Bush before him, Obama faces near unanimous disapproval from opposing partisans that is deeply dug in and unlikely to change….In the past half century, the only years that showed more polarization than Obama's sixth year were his -- and Bush's -- fourth and fifth years. All of that suggests that Obama's overall approval rating probably will not rise much above 50% for any sustained period."" [LA Times]

Four signs of an improving U.S. jobs situation - Drew DeSilver, summarizing Bureau of Labor Statistics: ""[1] More people are getting back into the labor market, even if they don’t immediately find jobs. [2] More people who want work are actually looking for it. [3] More people are quitting their jobs. [4] The unemployed are spending less time out of work."" [Pew]

ANOTHER NH POLL SHOWS NO GOP CANDIDATE OVER 20 PERCENT - Michael Bender & Lisa Lerer: ""Jeb Bush has taken a slight lead over other potential Republican presidential candidates in a new Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm New Hampshire poll...Bush now leads with just 16 percent. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is second with 13 percent, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is at 12 percent, and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, coming off a controversy-filled overseas trip, is at 10 percent...The poll also shows former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dominating her potential Democratic rivals. Clinton, who won the state’s presidential primary in 2008, is the first choice of 56 percent of Democratic primary voters.

WHAT TO MAKE OF EARLY POLLS, WALKER 'SURGE'? - Jonathan Bernstein: ""Let’s talk early-stage presidential primary polls. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has had something of a surge over the last week. What should we make of it? Is there any information to be squeezed out of these polls?...the latest polls tell us almost nothing about voters. Most people aren’t paying attention yet, which is why a bit of positive publicity for a candidate can shift polling quite a bit. Voters aren’t reporting firm decisions; they’re just responding to what’s been in the news lately. If these early polls are important, it is only because of the way the people who pay close attention to Republican Party politics react to them. That’s the real thing to watch, going forward.""

CQ RESEARCHER: BROAD OVERVIEW OF POLITICAL POLLING - Chuck McCutcheon: ""Smart phones, social media and the Internet have made it easier than ever for people to make their views known, but the new technology can make it harder for political pollsters to gather and measure public opinions with precision or consistency. They face public suspicions of partisanship, reluctance to provide candid answers and — as cellphone use grows — difficulty reaching respondents by the traditional method of random calls to household landlines…Polling has become entangled in the nation’s prevailing polarized political climate, with both politicians and the public questioning the validity of polls.""

Jun 03 2015,OPINION: Hillary Clinton troubled by declining economy,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/2/donald-lambro-hillary-clinton-troubled-by-declinin/,"OPINION:

Two of Hillary Clinton’s rivals for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination tell us everything we need to know about her party’s terminal political illness.

They include Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described Vermont socialist who says corporations, millionaires and billionaires and the big banks are responsible for all of our economic troubles. Bernie is running a distant second to Hillary in the latest polls.

And former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a far-left Democrat who slapped dozens of draconian taxes on his beleaguered state (including a levy on rainwater), and left it deeply in debt. He says he wants to do to the country what he did to his own state.

Neither of these men have a snowball’s chance of overtaking Mrs. Clinton. A recent Quinnipiac University poll shows the former secretary of state drawing 57 percent support from her fellow Democrats.

Mr. Sanders, whose socialist rhetoric is popular with much of his party’s base, is getting the support of 15 percent of Democrats who want to build a European-style, cradle-to-grave welfare state here at home.

Mr. O’Malley, little-known outside his state, garners just 1 percent, though he’s received gushing press treatment, both for his campaign skills and his far-left liberal record.

Campaign handicapper and ace political analyst Chris Cillizza puts him in third place in the nominating race as a result of his organizational skills in building a better campaign “infrastructure” in the early primary states.

Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley have succeeded politically because they come from heavily liberal Democratic states. Maryland is the second most-Democratic state in the United States, following Massachusetts, and Vermont runs fifth in the top 10 Democratic list.

But even Maryland’s liberal voters were fed up with the mess Mr. O’Malley had left the state in last year, electing Republican Gov. Larry Hogan Jr., who pledged to cut taxes, spending and create jobs.

It doesn’t appear Mrs. Clinton has much to fear from either of them — except for their growing appeal to their party’s legions of hardcore, far-left voters.

So far, Mrs. Clinton has been discussing the issues in broad generalities, providing no specifics about her governing agenda — and getting away with it.

But that could change once Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley began dishing out the kind of fiery, political red meat they are known for delivering with gusto.

Last Saturday in Iowa City, more than 400 voters turned out to hear Bernie bash Wall Street billionaires. Some said they drove eight hours all the way from Oklahoma City just to hear his ultra-leftist message

That’s going to put political pressure on Mrs. Clinton to beef up her message, perhaps on key issues she had avoided so far on the economy — taxes and spending.

Meantime, the controversy over her secret emails is going to resume, now that a judge has ruled that the State Department will have to begin dishing out portions of the 55,000 pages of messages each month that she sent on her privately run computer system.

This means that the secretive emails she wrote outside the government’s computer system about official matters will be a running TV news saga well into her presidential campaign.

Throw in nonstop congressional hearings Republicans are planning to hold on the email controversy, at which she will be asked to testify, and she faces a rocky road to the caucuses and primaries to come.

But the biggest issue for Mrs. Clinton will continue to be the U.S. economy’s persistent weakness and decline under the Obama administration.

Last week, the Commerce Department reported that the economy didn’t just slow down or stop growing in the first quarter of this year, as first reported. It shrank at a negative annual rate of 0.7 percent.

This is the third time this has happened since the 2008 recession ended.

Here’s the way The Wall Street Journal described what had happened:

“Data this week could show the U.S. economy shrank earlier this year, something that usually happens only during recessions. As the advisory firm Capital Economics recently asked, ‘Did the U.S. recovery just die without warning?’ “

The official definition of a recession is two back-to-back quarters when the economy contracts. Economists and President Obama think the economy will resume growing in second quarter, but that assurance is looking a little shaky right now.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is now forecasting that, at best, the economy will grow by just 0.8 percent in April, May and June.

If second-quarter gross domestic product comes in at that dismal rate, it means the Obama economy is in a virtual recession, or to be charitable, at best, it’s barely growing.

And that’s going to result in a lot of damaging political repercussions for the Democrats in the 2015-16 election cycle, and for Mrs. Clinton’s presidential ambitions.

The American people, God bless them, are watching all of this very closely.

So is the Gallup Poll: “U.S. Economic Confidence Index Slides in May,” blared the headline over the polling firm’s latest survey Tuesday.

It was the economic confidence index’s “third straight month in negative territory,” and the “lowest monthly average since November 2014,” the polling firm said.

“Americans’ confidence in the economy continued to slide,” Gallup said. And for good reason: The economy is shrinking. Manufacturing was weak. Gas prices are rising. Consumer spending is flat, as Americans fear the worst.

Mr. Obama has been telling us everything is fine. So have the news media and Hillary, too. Now we have fresh evidence that the U.S. economy is in a steep decline and that they haven’t been telling us the truth.

Dec 23 2014,White House takes credit for improving economy,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/23/white-house-takes-credit-improving-economy/,"The White House took credit Tuesday for an improving economic outlook in the third quarter, while acknowledging that falling gas prices also are helping.

Jason Furman, President Obama’s top economic adviser, hailed the government’s revised numbers showing that third-quarter gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 5 percent, up 1.1 percentage points from the initial estimate in November.

“The steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 already the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s,” Mr. Furman said in a blog post. “Indeed, 2014 was a breakthrough year for the United States.”

While crediting the president’s policies for the recovery, Mr. Furman also noted consumers are reporting that improved employment and wage expectations — along with declining gasoline prices — “as major drivers of improved economic optimism.”

“Consumer spending, business investment, and net exports all remained positive contributors this quarter,” he said.

Gas prices have fallen for 89 consecutive days, the longest on record, according to AAA. The national average price of regular gas has dropped nearly $1 per gallon, taking it to $2.38 a gallon for the first time in five years.

The exuberance was also noted on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average broke through the 18,000 barrier for the first time ever in Tuesday trading.

Nov 07 2014,"BLS Jobs Report Points To the ""Meh"" Economy",Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2014/11/07/bls-jobs-report-points-to-the-meh-economy-n1915597,"Advertisement

The Bureau of Labor Statistics released their report on non-farm payroll jobs today and estimated that the American economy added 214,000 jobs - pointing to an economy that continues to be sluggish. The workforce participation rate is unchanged from a year ago, at 62.8%. The unemployment rate edged slightly downward over the past month, though, and now sits at 5.8%.

.

A lot of key numbers when it comes to the numbers of unemployed remained unchanged. The long-term unemployed, the participation rate, the number of people underemployed, and the number of ""discouraged workers"" - people who have basically given up looking for work - all remained relatively unchanged.

Average hourly earnings remained unchanged, but the length of Americans' workweek is the highest since May 2008.

It's important to look for future revisions as well. This report, for example, revises BLS's estimates for August and September upwards by 31,000 jobs. August, which had been the worst jobs month of the year so far, was revised up from 180,000 to 203,000 jobs added.

Pre-report guidelines pointed to a report that would have come back with over 200,000 jobs, but this falls short of those expectations. Non-government payroll firm ADP estimated 230,000 jobs were added in the month of October, and MarketWatch's survey of economists produced a consensus guess of 243,000 - again, significantly higher than what the BLS actually estimated."
Mar 22 2021,Biden Team Prepares $3 Trillion in New Spending for the Economy,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html,"WASHINGTON — President Biden’s economic advisers are pulling together a sweeping $3 trillion package to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality, beginning with a giant infrastructure plan that may be financed in part through tax increases on corporations and the rich.

After months of internal debate, Mr. Biden’s advisers are expected to present the spending proposal to the president and congressional leaders this week, as well as begin outreach to industry and labor groups. On Monday, Mr. Biden’s national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, discussed his infrastructure plans — and their role in combating climate change — in a meeting with oil and gas industry executives.

Administration officials caution that details remain in flux. But the enormous scope of the proposal highlights the aggressive approach the Biden administration wants to take as it tries to harness the power of the federal government to make the economy more equitable, address climate change, and improve American manufacturing and high-technology industries in an escalating battle with China.

The $1.9 trillion economic aid package that Mr. Biden signed into law this month includes money to help vulnerable people and businesses survive the pandemic downturn. But it does little to advance the longer-term economic agenda that Mr. Biden campaigned on, including transitioning to renewable energy and improving America’s ability to compete in emerging industries, like electric vehicles. Administration officials essentially see those goals — building out the nation’s infrastructure and shifting to a low-carbon future — as inseparable."

Aug 19 2019,"Trump Dismisses Worries of Recession, Says Economy Is Strong",Newsmax (News),right,https://www.newsmax.com/finance/streettalk/us-trump-economy/2019/08/18/id/928967/,"President Donald Trump said Sunday the economy is ""doing very well"" and dismissed concerns of recession, offering an optimistic outlook after last week's steep drop in the financial markets.

""I don't think we're having a recession,"" Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington from his New Jersey golf club. ""We're doing tremendously well. Our consumers are rich. I gave a tremendous tax cut and they're loaded up with money.""

Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic adviser, also played down fears of a looming recession and predicted the economy will perform well in the second half of 2019. In Sunday television interviews, he said that consumers are seeing higher wages and are able to spend and save more.

""No, I don't see a recession,"" Kudlow said. ""We're doing pretty darn well in my judgment. Let's not be afraid of optimism.""

A strong economy is key to Trump's reelection prospects. Consumer confidence has dropped 6.4% since July. The president has spent most of the week at his golf club in New Jersey with much of his tweeting focused on talking up the economy.

Kudlow acknowledged a slowing energy sector, but said low interest rates will help housing, construction and auto sales.

Kudlow also defended the president's use of tariffs on goods coming from China. Before he joined the administration, Kudlow was known for opposing tariffs and promoting free trade during his career as an economic analyst. Kudlow said Trump has taught him and others that the ""China story has to be changed and reformed.""

""We cannot let China pursue these unfair and unreciprocal trading practices,"" Kudlow said.

Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke said the U.S. needed to work with allies to hold China accountable on trade. He said he fears Trump is driving the global economy into a recession.

""This current trade war that the president has entered our country into is not working,"" O'Rourke said. ""It is hammering the hell out of farmers across this country.""

Last month, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark rate — which affects many loans for households and businesses — by a quarter-point to a range of 2% to 2.25%. It's the first rate cut since December 2008 during the depths of the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed that the Fed was worried about the consequences of Trump's trade war and sluggish economies overseas.

""Weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy,"" he said.

Breaking with historical norms, Trump has been highly critical of Powell as he places blame for any economic weakness on the nation's central bank for raising interest rates too much over the past two years.

Peter Navarro, who advises Trump on trade policy, shared that sentiment.

""The Federal Reserve chairman should look in the mirror and say, 'I raised rates too far, too fast, and I cost this economy a full percentage point of growth,'"" Navarro said.

Navarro also said that U.S. consumers are not affected by the administration's trade war with China, though tariffs are taxes paid by U.S. importers, not by China, and are often passed along to U.S. businesses and consumers through higher prices.

Kudlow himself told Fox in May that U.S. consumers and businesses ultimately end up paying the tariffs that the administration imposes on billions of dollars of Chinese goods.

Trump acknowledged at least a potential impact when he paused a planned 10 percent tariff hike for many items coming from China, such as cellphones, laptops, video game consoles, some toys, computer monitors, shoes and clothing.

""We're doing (it) just for Christmas season, just in case some of the tariffs could have an impact,"" the president told reporters in New Jersey.

Navarro would not go even that far, saying Sunday ""there's no evidence whatsoever that Americans consumers are bearing any of this.""

Kudlow was interviewed on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" and ""Fox News Sunday."" O'Rourke spoke on NBC, and Navarro appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union"" and CBS' ""Face the Nation.""

Trump's trade war with China has been a target of criticism by Democrats vying to challenge him in 2020.

""There is clearly no strategy for dealing with the trade war in a way that will actually lead to results for American farmers or American consumers,"" said Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, a Democratic presidential candidate. He said on CNN that it was ""a fool's errand"" to think tariff increases will compel China to change its economic approach."
Jun 11 2014,Five challenges facing the American economy in 2014,American Enterprise Institute,right,http://www.aei.org/article/economics/five-challenges-facing-the-american-economy-in-2014/,"As the U.S. economy continues to sputter, American Enterprise Institute economists identify five areas that could heavily affect an American recovery in 2014: trade, the Federal Reserve, housing, taxes and the Internet.

Trade

The most important priority for the U.S. trade agenda in 2014 will be the successful conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, with 11 trading nations in the Asia Pacific.

The imperatives are both economic and diplomatic: the TPP is a central element of President Obama’s “pivot” to Asia and it forms the central core of a broader Asia regional economic architecture. Failure to conclude this agreement would have large-scale negative consequences for U.S. leadership in the Asia Pacific region, and risk ceding the game to Beijing. – Claude Barfield

Federal Reserve

The Fed faces extraordinary challenges in 2014. Under the new leadership of Janet Yellen, the Fed’s successful management of its pro-stimulus policy is an essential element of economic expansion in 2014. Its aggressive stance aimed at lowering the unemployment rate does not conflict with its two percent inflation target.

If inflation rises, however, the Fed will need to tighten – even if its lower unemployment rate target has not been reached – and the stock market will fall.

If, however, inflation keeps falling, the Fed will need either to buy even more securities and/or commit to a more extended period of zero short term interest rates. Otherwise, persistent disinflation or deflation will boost real interest rates and weaken growth. Either way, the Fed will have a tough 2014. –John H. Makin

Housing

A strong economy relies on a stable housing market, which depends on the preponderance of home loans being low risk. However, the government’s control of housing finance promotes risky lending: nearly one-half of home loans guaranteed recently by government agencies – FHA, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac – had down payments of 5 percent or less. Consequently, even a small drop in home prices would leave these borrowers underwater. The Fed’s policy of keeping interest rates at historically low levels is driving up house prices faster than rents and incomes.

This makes it difficult for first-time home buyers to purchase a home and creates the risk of another housing bubble. The solutions: increase the market’s reliance on private capital, return the FHA to traditional, sustainable lending practices, and allow interest rates to return to market levels. –Edward Pinto and Stephen Oliner

Tax Reform

Over the last 25 years, many countries have lowered their corporate tax rates leaving the United States with the highest rate in the developed world.

This discourages investment here, which holds down productivity and reduces wages. Congress and the President have failed to address this problem. Furthermore, the reforms being considered would barely reduce the tax burden on investment in the United States.

One solution would eliminate the corporate tax and instead tax corporate income fully at the stockholder level. Another approach would allow all investment costs to be immediately deducted rather than written off over years. Either of these reforms would simplify the tax system, encourage investment, and boost wages. –Alan Viard, Aparna Mathur, and Matt Jensen

The Internet

Since being privatized in the mid-1990s, the Internet has operated with minimal government intrusion.

This free-market digital environment is fertile ground for American entrepreneurial spirit. Eight of the top 10 Internet properties – including Facebook, Google and Microsoft – are “Made in the USA,” and U.S. firms dominate markets from smart phones to main frames.

Yet less market-oriented governments would have the United Nations as an international Internet regulator. They have gotten a big boost from the NSA spying revelations, which they say demonstrate the need for international oversight. These forces will try again in April at a U.N. meeting in Buenos Aires. Nothing could be worse for the United States. –Jeffrey Eisenach

Aug 30 2022,Senate GOP candidate Blake Masters suggests diversity at Federal Reserve is harming the economy,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2022-election/senate-gop-candidate-blake-masters-suggests-diversity-federal-reserve-rcna45389,"Blake Masters, the GOP nominee for a Senate seat in Arizona, suggested in a sarcastic tweet this week that the sluggish economy and the high rate of inflation were tied to diversity in the high ranks of the Federal Reserve.

""Finally a compelling explanation for why our economy is doing so well,"" Master, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, wrote Sunday in retweeting an Associated Press article with the headline: ""Fed tackles inflation with its most diverse leadership ever.""

The article noted that more female, Black and gay officials are now weighing in on interest-rate decision-making than ever before in the central bank's more-than-100-year history.

Masters defended his remarks Monday in a video on Twitter.

“I don’t care if every single employee at the Fed is a Black lesbian as long as they’re hired for their competence and not because of what they look like or who they sleep with,” Masters said. “News for Joe Biden: We are done with this affirmative action regime.”

Of affirmative action, Masters said, ""I can't think of a single policy since the end of Jim Crow that's been worse or more divisive for race relations in this country.""

Masters has suffered recent setbacks and come under scrutiny for shifting positions in his effort to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly.

Last week, Masters overhauled the policy page on his campaign website, scrubbing it of language that had taken a tough stance on abortion and rewriting or erasing five of his six positions on the issue.

Meanwhile, the Senate GOP’s top super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, has said it is slashing $8 million in ad spending in Arizona throughout September, as it looks for clear paths to boost Republicans’ chances of taking control of the chamber this fall.

Masters has frequently invoked race and drawn on culture wars in one of the most closely watched Senate races.

In an appearance on the podcast “The Jeff Oravits Show"" in April, Masters said “Black people, frankly,” were responsible for America’s gun violence problem.

In May, he was among a group of conservative candidates who invoked versions of the “great replacement theory” — a conspiracy theory that claims there is a plot to weaken the influence of white Americans — by saying Democrats want to give amnesty to thousands of immigrants to claim them as voters.

Masters has also disparaged Black women, having previously argued that Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman confirmed to the high court, was “a horrible pick” and an “affirmative action candidate.”

In Monday's video, Masters also attacked Vice President Kamala Harris, who he said was “so incompetent she can’t even get a sentence out.”

""There's such a thing as fairness. We're going to end this unfair and incompetent affirmative action regime,"" Masters added.

NBC News has asked Masters' and Kelly's campaign for comment."
Sep 02 2019,"Opinion: In This Economy, Every Day Should Be Labor Day",Guest Writer - Left,left,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikeelk/every-day-should-be-labor-day,"There’s a magical day that comes once each year when every news outlet publishes a story or two about workers and the labor movement. Then we all go to bed, wake up the next morning, and return to a world where unions and workers are hardly noticed at all.

The lack of attention paid to labor issues — the overwhelming majority of news outlets lack a single full-time labor reporter — has disastrous results, particularly for workers in the anti-union South. According to research by University of Northern Iowa media studies professor Chris Martin, there are “just six full-time labor reporters in the top 25 newspapers across the US, none in network or cable news, none at NPR or PBS, and just a few at digital news organizations and magazines on the left.”

The results speak for themselves. Earlier this summer, workers at a Volkswagen factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, voted against unionizing by a margin of just 23 votes. Victory would have led to the first unionized foreign-owned auto plant in the South, and likely would have opened the door for more unions in the country’s most worker-hostile region.

I was there on the ground in Chattanooga in the lead-up to the vote, and watched as Volkswagen and its anti-union allies defined the United Automobile Workers, one of the country’s largest unions, as an outside force that destroyed Detroit. In the press and in paid TV ads, they warned that the union was only interested in taking money from workers and could destroy the region’s auto factories.

The message worked. After the narrow defeat in the union vote, many local labor activists blamed the media’s failure to cover local unions already in the area as a key reason why many workers voted against them.

“We’ve got over 5,000 union members in Chattanooga, and the media didn’t make it seem like unions were already in Chattanooga,” said LaKecha Strickland, a local bus driver and member of the Chattanooga Area Labor Council. “The public is not aware of the unions because the media doesn’t cover them, so when unions try to organize in Chattanooga, they are seen as outsiders.”

But recent years have shown that when workers in the South do get positive coverage, they are able to win. Just look at the teachers strikes in states like Kentucky, West Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia — or the widespread public support for laid-off coal miners demonstrating in Kentucky.

The teachers strikes “had a lot of community support and that was portrayed in the media,” said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. “I think what happened with the UAW was that they ran a great campaign, but the outside ambient noise was deafening.”

North Carolina, where 20,000 teachers went on strike in May 2018, currently is tied with South Carolina for the lowest unionization rate in the country — with just 2.7% of all workers belonging to unions there. But the state’s labor movement is now growing, with unions gaining 3,000 new members in 2018. It has gained members in each of the last three years.

Union leaders in North Carolina say that if only the media would cover their progress, they could make even more progress.

“When the media doesn’t cover important struggles, especially victories that we are having in the South, it discourages rather than inspires workers who want to organize,” said North Carolina AFL-CIO President MaryBe McMillan. And on the other side, many warn that the failure to cover workers leads to even further distrust in the media, at a time when the right is pushing a constant anti-media message.

“Why would people attend to a media that doesn’t value them as audience members?” said Martin, author of the new book No Longer Newsworthy: How the Mainstream Media Abandoned the Working Class. “They aren’t talking to you so why would you believe them?”

Instead, Martin said many workers turn away from mainstream media to alternative sources.

“There is a conservative media that really tries to appeal to at least part of the working class, the white working class, for more cultural rather than economic reasons, but that really divides the working class racially,” he said. “But it also just hurts the morale of the working class in general, because they are not seeing themselves, and what a good idea it would be to belong to a labor union portrayed on any regular basis in the media.”

Public sentiment toward unions is at its highest level in 50 years, according to a recent Gallup opinion poll that showed 64% voicing approval. The question is: Will workers fighting for their rights keep getting attention once Labor Day is past us? Or will right-wing propagandists, who seek to divide workers on issues of race and gender, be the winners of a media industry that overlooks the working class?"

This was a far weaker jobs report than expected. Economists had forecast 545,000 positions added to payrolls and an unemployment rate of 4.5 percent, according to Econoday.

The unemployment rates for adult men and adult women declined to 4.0 percent. The white unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent and the black unemployment rate fell to 6.7 percent. The Hispanic unemployment rate declined to 5.2 percent. There was little change in the unemployment rates for Asians, at 3.8 percent, or teenagers, at 11.2 percent.

The labor force participation rate inched up to 61.8 percent in November but remains 1.5 percentage points lower than in February 2020. The employment-population ratio rose by 0.4 percentage point to 59.2 percent in November. This measure is up from its low of 51.3 percent in April 2020 but remains below the figure of 61.1 percent in February 2020.

Surprisingly, employment in retail trade declined by 20,000 in November. General merchandise stores shed 20,000 jobs, clothing stores shrank employment by 18,000, and sporting goods, hobby, book, and music store employment declined by 9,000. That raises questions about the strength of retail going into the holiday season.

Average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 8 cents to $31.03. Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have

increased by 4.8 percent, less than the rate of inflation. Average hourly earnings of private-sector production and nonsupervisory employees rose by 12 cents to $26.40. The average workweek for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls increased by 0.1 hour to 34.8 hours in November. In manufacturing, the average workweek edged up by 0.1 hour to 40.4 hours, and overtime was unchanged at 3.2 hours. The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory employees on private nonfarm payrolls was unchanged at 34.1 hours.

The figures for September and October were revised up.

Seasonal adjustments were large in November. Before adjustments, the economy added 778,000 jobs. The retail sector added 331,000 jobs in November but with seasonal adjustments, this gets counted as a loss of 20,000 because Labor Department economists expected even more retail hiring in the holiday shopping season."

When voters grade the President on the economy, he averages a C-.

Voters continue to be pessimistic over the future of the economy. A 58-percent majority thinks the worst is yet to come. Not only is that up from 52 percent a year ago, but it is also the highest level recorded since April 2009. At that time, 66 percent said the worst is yet to come.



When asked to grade Obama for the job he’s done on improving the economy, nine percent give him an “A,” while 22 percent give him a “B” and 22 percent a “C.” A sizable minority thinks he deserves a grade of “D” (14 percent) or “F” (24 percent). Another nine percent give an “incomplete.”



That makes the president’s grade-point average 1.78, which is a C-minus. That’s about the same as Obama received in 2012.

These numbers come after two months of dismal job reports and just after the administration announced another one year delay of the Obamacare business mandate."

This is way below the number that private forecaster ADP estimated were added in December - 238,000 - and could be a sign that estimates have become very variable in the recovery.

Despite the discouraging top-line number, the unemployment rate dropped three tenths of a percentage point, to 6.7%. The broader U-6 unemployment statistic, which takes into account underemployment, was steady at 13.1%. November's jobs report was revised upwards by 38,000 people as well.

The number of people employed part-time for economic reasons - also known as involuntarily employed part-time - was unchanged in December.

The reason for the dip in unemployment is obvious: 347,000 Americans left the labor force. There could be a number of factors that play into this, including retirements, but a large number of discouraged people left the labor force. The labor force participation rate is now at 62.8% - the lowest since 1978."
Jul 05 2019,"US economy adds 224,000 jobs in June",CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/05/economy/june-jobs-report/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

The US economy added 224,000 jobs in June, a strong comeback for the labor market after a disappointing May.

The unemployment rate rose to 3.7%, the highest level since March 2019 but still historically low.

The number substantially beat the expectations of analysts, who had forecast a drag on jobs because of business uncertainty around high trade tensions as well as a lackluster housing market.

Adding to the positive story, 335,000 people entered the labor force in June — substantially more than usual — which may have been what pushed the unemployment rate up slightly. It’s a remarkable feat for an economy that has been soaking up workers for 106 straight months, and an indication that people are still finding reasons to go back to work.

The number looks more like the robust 2018 monthly job gain average than the lower average so far in 2019, forestalling concerns about a sharp slowdown even as indicators of business sentiment have turned negative.

However, there are still signs that the labor market won’t go back to last year’s blistering pace. Daniel Zhao, senior economist with the job search and review site Glassdoor, says employers’ hiring needs aren’t growing as fast as they had been.

“The number of job openings is very healthy, pretty close to historic highs, but the rate at which it’s growing is slowing dramatically,” Zhao said. “When that year-over-year growth rate in job openings turns negative, that will be a major signal that the labor is slowing down.”

The largest employment gains came in health care and professional and business services, although manufacturing turned in a robust 17,000 jobs after four months of little change — a surprise turnaround for an industry that has been flagging with higher raw material costs due to tariffs and the downturn of world trade.

Retail employment showed little change again in June, though transportation and warehousing — which can be a sign of consumption migrating from physical stores to shopping online — added 24,000 jobs.

The one still-disappointing number: Average hourly earnings, which rose 3.1% from a year earlier, slightly lower than forecast. While still beating inflation, wages should be growing faster this late in the business cycle, as employers compete to attract workers.

In some sectors, they are: Year over year wage growth for retail workers and those in leisure and hospitality, for example, has neared 5% over the past few months. But that doesn’t hold true more broadly.

Jason Guggisberg, vice president at the large staffing firm Adecco, says he’s advised companies to hike pay more in order to attract more qualified workers — but they’ve been reluctant to do so, citing uncertainty about how much longer the recovery will last.

“That wage conversation has been going on for years now,” Guggisberg says. “They’ve been dragging their feet, waiting to see what happens. The answer’s always, ‘it’s not in the budget.’”

Despite the positive news for the economy, markets opened down on Friday upon the realization that the Federal Reserve would find little justification in the June jobs report to cut interest rates substantially at its next meeting."
Nov 22 2021,Biden reappoints Jerome Powell as Fed chairman at a critical time for the economy,NPR (Online News),left,https://www.npr.org/2021/11/22/1052741845/biden-reappoints-jerome-powell-as-federal-reserve,"Biden reappoints Jerome Powell as Fed chairman at a critical time for the economy

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images

President Biden has chosen to keep Jerome Powell in place for a second term as Federal Reserve chairman — a move that signals continuity with the central bank's policies at a time when the economy faces critical challenges, including surging inflation

Biden nominated current Fed governor Lael Brainard to serve as vice chair. Brainard had been seen as a leading contender to replace Powell.

Under Powell and Brainard the Fed has kept interest rates near zero despite the current high prices for all kinds of goods, as it focuses on returning the economy to full employment and as policymakers argue that inflation will prove temporary.

""Powell and Brainard share the Administration's focus on ensuring that economic growth broadly benefits all workers,"" the White House said in a statement.

Biden's pick to stick with Powell will likely reassure financial markets, despite opposition from some progressive members of the president's own party.

Powell, a Republican, was originally appointed to the Fed's governing board by former President Barack Obama and was elevated to the chairman's post by then-President Donald Trump.

As chairman, Powell has steered the central bank's aggressive response to the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, slashing interest rates to near zero and quickly launching a series of emergency lending programs.

Powell also oversaw a new Fed policy that directs the central bank to be patient in raising interest rates in hopes of fostering more widespread job growth.

That policy was adopted in 2020 after years in which inflation fell short of the Fed's 2% target, but it's now being tested as prices have surged, pushing inflation to a 31-year high.

The Labor Department says prices in October were 6.2% higher than a year ago, the sharpest increase since 1990.

Powell and his colleagues believe today's price hikes are largely the result of temporary factors tied to the pandemic, which should ease on their own as the health outlook improves. It's a view that's been challenged by some economists and prominent Democrats such as former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.

The central bank has to weigh the risk of tolerating higher inflation against the cost of choking off job growth with higher interest rates at a time when millions of people are still out of work.

""It's extremely important that we get that right,"" Powell said recently at a conference sponsored by the South African Reserve Bank. ""I am confident that we will do so over the course of the next year or so. I think in the meantime, it's going to be extremely challenging, certainly in the short term.""

Powell has faced opposition from progressives

Progressive critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have accused Powell of watering down bank regulations adopted in the aftermath of the financial crisis. At a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing, Warren described Powell as ""a dangerous man.""

That criticism failed to get much traction, though. The co-sponsors of the Dodd-Frank law behind those bank regulations, former Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., and former Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., have defended Powell and said he deserves a second term.

Powell has also had to navigate an ethics controversy after reports this fall that two former presidents of regional Federal Reserve banks actively traded stocks and other securities last year, at a time when the central bank was heavily involved in financial markets.

Former Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and former Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren retired last month after the trades came to light. Both men have denied any wrongdoing, but Kaplan acknowledged that the controversy could be a distraction for the central bank. Rosen said he was stepping down for health reasons.

The Fed's inspector general is reviewing the two men's trades, which appear to be in compliance with the central bank's rules at the time. The Fed has since adopted stricter rules that limit the trading of individual stocks and bonds and require disclosure of any trades within 30 days.

""We have to have the complete trust of the American people that we're working in their interest all the time,"" Powell said in describing the new rules.

In nominating Powell for a second term, Biden is observing a tradition that Fed chairs typically don't change, even when the party in control of the White House does. That's one way to safeguard the central bank's political independence. Trump broke with that tradition when he replaced then-Fed Chair Janet Yellen, a Democrat who is now Treasury secretary, with Powell four years ago.

Powell's nomination is subject to confirmation in the Senate, where he is expected to get broad, bipartisan support."

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The nation's gross domestic product expanded at a meager 0.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter -- well below the forecasts for 1.2 percent growth. The slowdown reflected weaker exports, a decline in business investment and cuts in state and local government spending, among other things. The recovery was propped up by strong consumer spending, driven in part by health-care spending after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.

The Commerce Department, which releases the data, emphasized that the numbers are preliminary. The government will revise the data twice more as additional information is collected. Economists had already trimmed their expectations for growth during the quarter in the face of this year’s brutally cold winter. Many believe the slowdown is only temporary and that the recovery will enjoy a bounceback through the spring.

""This is not a weak economy,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""This is an economy that had two bad months because of the weather and got back to normal in March.""

The major U.S. stock indexes opened in the red Wednesday. By late morning, the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down slightly, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 was slightly above flat. The blue-chip Down Jones Industrial Average was up 0.12 percent.

Ashworth predicts that growth in the second quarter will pick up to an annual rate of 3.5 percent before settling down to 3 percent for the year. Private data released Wednesday morning by human resources firm ADP showed the country added 220,000 jobs in April --better than analysts had anticipated. The government's official tally of job creation is slated for release Friday.

""The job market is gaining strength,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, which calculates the ADP report. ""After a tough winter, employers are expanding payrolls across nearly all industries and company sizes.""

But there are concerns that the dismal report could signal more fundamental weakness in the economy. In particular, the real estate market has softened as rising prices and higher mortgage rates have made homes less affordable. New home sales were below expectations in March, while pending home sales plunged that month.

But data released Tuesday suggested the increase in home prices may be moderating. According to the S&P/Case-Shiller index, prices were up 13 percent for the 12 months ending in February in 20 major cities, a slower pace than in January. That could be good news for buyers.

""Home sales will pick up in the near term as the labor market continues to improve, consumer confidence increases, and lenders gradually ease their standards for mortgages,"" PNC Financial Services Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman said in a note to clients. ""This will more than offset the drag on affordability from higher mortgage rates.""

The Federal Reserve is slated to weigh in on the economy Wednesday afternoon in an official statement following its two-day policy meeting in Washington. The nation’s central bank had characterized growth during the first quarter as ""slowing,"" in part due to the weather. It also noted the housing market had cooled off, though Fed Chair Janet Yellen later said the sector has turned a corner.

The Fed's assessment of the strength of the recovery will be a critical factor in how quickly it removes support for the economy. Since the beginning of the year, the Fed has been steadily reducing the amount of money it is pumping into the recovery and is expected to announce another cut of $10 billion on Wednesday. That program will likely end altogether in the fourth quarter, but the weak GDP reading has the potential to complicate those plans.

The Fed is also debating when it should raise its benchmark short-term interest rate, which has been at zero since 2008. Increasing the rate would be a sign that the central bank is confident that the economy can stand on its own. The Fed said it would consider the health of the labor market and inflation expectations in determining the right moment to make a change."

The U.S. economy held steady with ""modest to moderate"" growth between early July and late August, as Americans bought more cars and auto factories ramped up hiring.

The Federal Reserve's so-called Beige Book, comprising reports from 12 geographic districts around the country, showed that manufacturing activity ""expanded modestly"" and that several districts reported that ""demand for inputs related to autos, housing, and infrastructure were strong.""

""Chicago highlighted the auto industry as a main source of strength for that District's overall manufacturing sector, and contacts there expect demand for heavy and medium trucks to ratchet up further and to support growth in overall manufacturing for the remainder of the year.""

The Associated Press says: ""Recent economic data has been mixed, but not weak enough to suggest any upset to a sluggish recent recovery, which is slowly bringing down unemployment.""

The Beige Book report also pointed to activity in the real estate market, saying ""rising home prices and mortgage interest rates may have spurred a pickup in recent market activity, as many 'fence sitters' were prompted to commit to purchases."" It also noted an uptick in tourism and a modest improvement in the nonfinancial services sector.

Hiring, it said, held steady or increased somewhat in most regions, with St. Louis in particular reporting increases in employment in manufacturing."
Jul 22 2013,Obama Plans to Unveil His Agenda for Economy,New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/us/politics/obama-plans-to-unveil-his-agenda-for-economy.html,"WASHINGTON — With major battles looming in the fall over the federal budget and the debt ceiling, President Obama is trying to regain the initiative, embarking on a campaign-style tour of the Midwest this week to lay out his agenda for reinvigorating the nation’s economy, administration officials said Sunday.

Mr. Obama’s offensive will begin on Wednesday in Galesburg, Ill., with what his aides are saying will be a major address on economic policy at Knox College. Officials declined to provide details of the president’s message, but said he would set his terms for what they expect will be another bruising battle with a Republican-controlled House over the nation’s fiscal policies.

White House officials liken Wednesday’s speech to one he gave in 2011 in Osawatomie, Kan., where he articulated the theme of economic inequality in American society that became a leitmotif of his re-election campaign, and to one at Georgetown University soon after taking office in 2009, when he talked about how the American economy would recover from the Great Recession.

September will be the fifth anniversary of the financial crisis that underscored that recession, and White House officials said Mr. Obama wanted to take stock of the economy’s recovery and chart a path forward."

Jan 21 2021,Joe Biden’s vision for the economy unifies Obama’s vision with Trump’s,Quartz,center,https://qz.com/1960579/bidens-economic-plan-puts-his-unity-theme-into-practice/,"Newly elected president Joe Biden’s inaugural address couldn’t have been clearer about his highest priority: to restore unity.

It is both a lofty and necessary goal. Unity is Biden’s only path to swiftly address the country’s spiraling health and economic crises in the wake of a president who derived his legitimacy from sowing division and distrust. “We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance and humility, and if we’re willing to stand in the other person’s shoes,” Biden said during his address.

Trump, by contrast, used his 2017 inaugural address to undermine the American public’s faith in the benefits of cooperation domestically and abroad. Four years later, the pandemic’s global nature and its economic repercussions have made clear that the isolationism of the Trump era did little to protect the American worker.

At the same time, the pandemic has underscored how the US’s lax approach to global market forces, which was largely maintained through the Obama years, also left American workers vulnerable. Biden’s task, then, is to convince Americans that there is a viable middle path to shared prosperity, one that unifies notions of global openness and cooperation with stronger worker protections.

Biden’s cabinet nominations suggest he’s off to a good start. Janet Yellen, the president’s pick for Treasury secretary, a venerable labor economist, has earned the respect of Democrats and Republicans alike for her shrewd, unbiased approach. She will assume the daunting task of rescuing the American economy with perspective gleaned from its highest possible vantage points: as chair of the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers, chair of the Federal Reserve, and, if confirmed, as Treasury secretary. As such, she is well-versed in the importance of the central bank and Treasury working in tandem to coax a recovery.

She also understands better than most how to navigate the risk of inflation—both economically and politically. As a monetary policymaker, not only did she prove to be one of the Fed’s most accurate forecasters, but also managed to gain the backing of hawks and doves in hiking interest rates. On fiscal policy, she has argued both sides of the coin—advising against stimulus spending when deemed unnecessary shortly before Obama’s term ended, and now for it in response to the pandemic.

Gary Gensler, Biden’s nominee to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), similarly bridges diverse points of view. He made his name in Washington as a fierce regulator of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, where he wrote rules to rein in the bloated derivatives market, largely blamed for the financial crisis. But he is also a creature of Wall Street who made partner at Goldman Sachs at age 30 and stuck with it for 18 years. Democrats are looking to Gensler to ramp up investor protections and company disclosures on the environment, diversity, and worker pay. Wall Street, by contrast, may be comforted by Gensler’s financial acumen and caution about market disruptions.

Biden has been equally thoughtful in his pick for the top trade-policy job. Trade lawyer Katherine Tai was central to bridging the divide between Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration on the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA), which Trump signed last year to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). “The president-elect’s vision is to implement a worker-centered trade policy,” Tai said in her first speech since her nomination. The USMCA, a possible model for Biden’s trade policy, focuses on domestic manufacturing jobs, and tougher environmental and worker protections.

Tai, a fluent Mandarin speaker who has litigated US trade disputes with China at the WTO, would likely favor working on China with US allies through the WTO, in contrast to Trump’s unilateral approach of, for example, slapping tariffs on Chinese goods. And yet, Tai is wary of the threat posed by China, an economy she has characterized as “directed by central planners, who are not subject to the pressures of political pluralism, democratic elections, popular opinion.”

If the greatest risk to the economic recovery is political gridlock, these nominations suggest that Biden’s commitment to unity isn’t political bluster. Republicans and Democrats have spent months failing to agree on an economic rescue package to supplement the one that took effect in the spring, despite massive small business failures and rising jobless claims. Financial markets are already celebrating the prospect of a unified front to finally figure it out. Congress should feel good enough about Biden’s intentions to do the same."
Apr 15 2019,4 ways Trump's tax cuts changed the American economy,CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/economy/trump-tax-cuts-impact-economy/index.html,"Monday is the first Tax Day under the new rules of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but Americans have been adapting to the law since it passed in late 2017.

Some of its effects are already visible, and some of them will take months, or even years, to understand. After all, economists are still publishing studies about the effect of the last comprehensive tax overhaul back in 1986, signed by Ronald Reagan.

Here’s what we can — and can’t — say about how President Donald Trump’s tax cuts have impacted the economy so far.

1. Corporate taxes fell off a cliff, fueling deeper deficits

One of the central features of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was a drop in the corporate income tax rate, from 35% to 21%.

Even though plenty of companies never paid that full rate because of various exemptions, the decrease still took a big bite out of corporate tax collections. They plunged from a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of $264 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $149 billion the next, when the new rules went into effect, and they haven’t bounced back.

We were the highest taxed place on earth. Now we are not.” Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers

Corporate income taxes make up only a small slice of the federal government’s overall tax revenue, and have declined as a share of the economy from their post-World War II height in 1951. However, corporate tax revenue still tends to increase when the economy is doing well. This is the first time corporate taxes have taken such a hit when the economy is not in recession.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecasts that corporate income tax revenues will gradually rise in the coming years, as will personal income taxes — but not enough for the tax cuts to “pay for themselves,” as their Republican backers claimed they would. According to the CBO, the tax overhaul is set to add $1.85 trillion to the national debt over an 11-year period, even accounting for positive macroeconomic effects.

Congress has yet to take up spending cuts to big-ticket items like Medicare and Social Security that the White House had proposed to curb deficits. Still, mounting debt makes conversations around future expenditures more difficult. Lawmakers have choked on passing a large infrastructure package, for example, because there’s no plan to pay for it.

“In some ways, our economy is held back by the public investments that we are not making,” said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy for the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. “Even if we think that spending on infrastructure would be a good thing, politically we can’t do this spending because we have to address this deficit.”

2. A short-term economic boost is fading

Most economists forecast that the tax cuts, along with a boost to military spending, would goose the economy initially. The CBO estimates that about 0.3 percentage points of the 2.9% growth in gross domestic product in 2018 can be attributed to the tax cuts.

Part of that came from an increase in business investment in research and development, new factories and equipment, possibly encouraged by a provision that allowed businesses to immediately expense capital expenditures, rather than expense them gradually over several years. Business investment grew 8.4% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter or 2018. That’s a good sign because better factories, equipment and tools are supposed to boost productivity, which in some cases allows workers to make more money.

Wages did start to grow a bit faster at the end of 2018, at least by some measures, especially for workers on the lower end of the income spectrum. But that was also a consequence of a tight labor market created by nearly a decade of continuous job growth, as well as minimum wage hikes in many states.

The White House’s Council of Economic Advisers used the growth surge in 2018 to trumpet the tax cuts as a success. The new lower corporate rate and temporary tax holiday on the repatriation of cash earned overseas, they argue, created a surge of investable capital — though companies returned a large chunk of it to investors in the form of share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions.

At the same time, they say the effects will take years to play out.

“We were the highest taxed place on earth. Now we are not,” said CEA Chair Kevin Hassett on CNN last week. “The adjustment to having all the industry come home is not something that happens overnight, it spreads out over three to five years.”

At the moment, though, trends are moving in the wrong direction. Business’ plans for capital expenditures have been declining for about a year now, according to an index maintained by Morgan Stanley. And aside from those who work for the White House, most economists — including those who work at the Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund — expect US economic growth to decline to about 2.1% to 2.3% in 2019.

Why? One possibility is that the boost in business investment may have had more to do with a rise in oil prices, which now drives a significant amount of domestic activity because of the US’ vast shale reserves, according to an analyst at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business.

The hurdle to investment in recent years has more to do with weak demand for goods rather than a shortage of capital, according to Kyle Pomerleau, chief economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.

“If you look at the US economy, it’s not lack of cash that’s keeping companies from investing,” Pomerleau said. “The whole issue is whether that cash can be deployed in a productive manner. Are there investments out there that result in a high enough after-tax return to be worthwhile?”

As evidence that there aren’t, most multinational companies haven’t fundamentally changed the complex tax structures that allow them to book profits overseas, according to an analysis by Council on Foreign Relations senior fellow Brad Setser.

You have two tax policies working against one another.” Kyle Pomerleau, Chief Economist at the Tax Foundation

Meanwhile, the White House has engaged in a trade war that makes raw materials like lumber and steel more expensive in the US, raising the cost of domestic production.

“You have two tax policies working against one another,” Pomerleau says.

3. Rich people gained more than poor people

About 66% of taxpayers saw their federal tax bill decline by more than $100 in 2018, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation reported in March. And according to the tax preparation giant H&R Block, total liabilities are down by nearly 25%. But the magnitude of those reductions varies a lot according to how much money you make, and has had the overall effect of widening income inequality in America.

Here’s one way of looking at it: As a result of both the business and personal income tax cuts, households making between $500,000 and $1 million will see their after-tax income rise by an average of 5.2%. Households making less than $50,000 (the median income is $61,372 in the US) see only a 0.6% increase.

In part, that’s because of a provision that allows taxpayers that earn money through “pass-through” businesses to take a deduction equal to 20% of that income. Pass-through businesses include everything from architecture firms to part-time landlords incorporated as partnerships and limited liability companies.

“The people who are benefiting the most, and the people who are benefiting the most through pass-throughs, are really rich people,” said Jason Oh, a tax law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles.

Lower-income people, meanwhile, pay very little in taxes already and thus didn’t benefit as much. They may even be hurt by the pass-through deduction. According to Nancy Abramowitz, head of the federal tax legal clinic at American University, employers have used it as a reason to encourage low-wage workers to become independent contractors, which also comes with the loss of many rights and benefits.

The tax act’s unequal distribution of benefits is now prompting calls for further changes to even the scales.

Capitalizing on polling showing that most people believe the tax system is unfairly skewed towards the wealthy, 46 Senate Democrats have backed a bill that would effectively boost subsidies for children and earned income. It attracted no Republican co-sponsors and had no price tag attached. But several announced Presidential candidates have similar plans, so if the Senate and the White House flip in 2020, it stands a good chance of becoming law.

4. Most other impacts: Either too soon to tell or too hard to see

The 2017 tax overhaul either pleased or dismayed a host of special interests, but it’s still difficult to know whether their respective hopes or fears came true.

Take the mortgage interest deduction, which was capped at $750,000 in total amount borrowed and also weakened by the doubling of the standard deduction. Realtors worried that would put people off from buying homes — especially the most expensive ones.

So far, signals are mixed. New home sales increased in 2018 over the previous year, according to the National Association of Home Builders, even though construction permits leveled off. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that some of that was likely due to several provisions in the tax overhaul, including the limitation on the mortgage interest deduction.

The homeownership rate, however, has continued to rebound from a low in 2016. And the housing market is subject to so many other factors — from mortgage interest rates to the price of concrete — that it’s hard to isolate the impact of a tweaked tax provision.

The same is true of the capped state and local tax deduction, which disproportionately hurt states with high tax burdens like New Jersey and California. So far, according to a report by Moody’s Investor Service, there hasn’t been any noticeable uptick in migration out of those states; many people move from one high-tax state to another.

“Job opportunities and demographic trends influence migration more than tax rates,” the report said.

Finally, nonprofits had fretted that since fewer people would be taking the charitable deduction, their contributions might sag. The Penn-Wharton Budget Model predicted the tax law would decrease charitable giving by $22 billion in 2018. Instead, an annual report from the Lilly Family School of Philanthropy at Indiana University projected above-trend growth in giving for 2019 and 2020, fueled by a healthy stock market and rising incomes.

However, the effect will be uneven. Lower-income filers will no longer benefit from the charitable deduction, which means the causes they favor may lose out.

“Larger institutions that depend on higher-income households may not feel the impact,” said Una Osili, who authored the Indiana University report. “But if you think about the causes that everyday givers support, like community based organizations, they see more of an impact.”

The impact that’s unseen

Most of the true impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is still yet to be felt. But one implication is already operating in the background. Tax cuts can help ease the impact of economic downturns, and now, there’s a lot less room to use them.

“The thing that’s related that I’m more concerned about is, we will eventually face another recession,” says Oh, of UCLA. “And what we’ve done through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is use a bunch of the tools that we need to deal with the next recession, at a time when we don’t have a recession.”"

Mar 28 2013,10 Tax Laws That Hurt the Economy Most,Fiscal Times,right,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/03/28/10-Tax-Laws-That-Hurt-the-Economy-Most.aspx#page1,"If you watch the budget battles in Washington, it might appear the only discussion about taxes is whether they should be increased, cut, or kept where they are. But policy experts are engaged in a tax conversation that may be more important—how to make the tax system simpler and smarter.

Currently, terms to describe the current code are more like “complicated,” “obscure,” and even “unconscionable,” all of which have appeared in reports by tax policy groups looking at how to fix the system. The cost of navigating this maze to taxpayers and businesses hit $163 billion in 2010, more than 1 percent of GDP. It’s gotten so bad that small and mid-sized companies have started passing up tax breaks they’re eligible for because they’re too confusing and costly to take, according to a report last summer in the Wall Street Journal.

RELATED: 13 Tax Breaks You’ve Never Heard Of

Despite the agreement on the need to clean up the tax system, almost every tax law has a constituency that will fight hard to keep it. Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, has spent some $11.5 million lobbying to keep the tax filing process complicated for taxpayers, according to a recent report by ProPublica and NPR.

To measure the effectiveness of each tax law, experts have devised several criteria. The U.S. Government Accountability Office, for example, has three measures: (1) a tax law’s fairness, (2) the extent to which it promotes economic efficiency (that is, provides more economic benefits to society than the private sector would provide on its own), and (3) the degree to which it’s simple, transparent, and easy to administer by the IRS.

Here are ten tax laws that could stand to be revised—or eliminated all together:

1. The AMT boondoggle: Congress passed the AMT in 1982 to ensure that the well-off pay at least some tax each year. But a report earlier this year from the National Taxpayer Advocate, the watchdog arm of the IRS, says that the AMT doesn’t achieve that goal at all--many middle- and upper-middle-class taxpayers pay the AMT, while most wealthy taxpayers don’t. And thousands of millionaires pay no income tax at all. Meanwhile, the AMT makes calculating what you owe the government far more complex than it used to be since taxpayers essentially have to compute their tax liabilities twice—once under the regular tax rules and again under the AMT, says the report. Congress at least permanently indexed the AMT for inflation in passing the fiscal cliff deal on January 3. But that doesn’t make it a better tax—it just limits the number of those in the middle class whom the AMT hits.

2. The pro sports subsidy: Current tax law allows the National Football League, Professional Golfers’ Association, and National Hockey League to operate as nonprofits. You read right—the NFL, which generated $184 million from its teams and held more than $1 billion in assets in 2010, pays no federal income tax. According to Waste Book 2012, an annual report by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, the NFL gets its tax-free status under a provision of the code that allows industry and trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce to qualify. Cost to the taxpayers? At least $91 million a year just for the NFL and NHL, according to the Waste Book.

3. Byzantine tax phase-outs: If our tax returns are needlessly complicated, one reason is the use of phase-outs, says the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. These are tax exemptions and credits that get limited as a taxpayer’s income rises, with the goal of providing more help to people at lower incomes. But they make figuring out what effect an extra dollar of income will have on the taxes you owe almost impossible. The center notes, for example, that the tax code reduces the $1,000-per-child tax credit by 5 percent of adjusted gross income over $75,000 for single parents. The share of expenses allowed for the child care credit falls from 35 percent to 20 percent as adjusted gross increases from $15,000 to $43,000. And single taxpayers with an adjusted gross above $55,000 may not deduct the interest they pay on student loans. For a more progressive tax structure, the National Taxpayer Advocate recommends further adjusting the marginal tax rates—and killing the phase-outs.

4. The high-tech loophole: The Government Accountability Office notes that there’s a legitimate place for governments to subsidize research that benefits society but doesn’t turn a profit. But there’s no reason for companies to get a subsidy for research and development that they would have done anyway, says the GAO. That’s exactly what happens now—companies like Microsoft, Boeing, and Harley Davidson have taken the research and development tax credit and written off the cost of designing profitable new technologies, products, and processes, notes tax watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense.http://doeren.com/blog/tag/research-and-development-tax-credits/

5. The convoluted capital gains tax: The Tax Policy Center notes capital gains income is subject to at least eight different effective tax rates, depending on the taxpayer’s regular tax rate, how long an asset was owned, the type of asset, and whether the taxpayer owes AMT— one of the three IRS worksheets used to calculate the tax runs to 37 lines. It’s gotten even more complex in 2013 with a new 3.8 percent Medicare surtax rate starting on those with an adjusted gross income of $200,000 single or $250,000 married. The center favors cutting the thicket of paperwork by allowing a percentage exclusion of capital gains income for long-term gains (to encourage savings) and applying regular tax rates to the rest.

6. Special treatment for Hollywood: At a time when movie studios Time Warner and News Corp. both recorded 2012 profits of about $1.2 billion, it might seem odd that they need a special favor in the tax code. But they got one anyway—as part of the fiscal cliff deal, Congress and the White House renewed special expensing rules for film and TV production. Under that provision, filmmakers and TV studios have the option of immediately deducting (as opposed to writing off over the normal 15 to 39 years) up to $15 million in program production costs as long as 75 percent of the costs are for services performed in the U.S. That may have started out as an effort to keep film and television production at home, but now it amounts to a tax subsidy to Hollywood worth $225 million a year, according to Taxpayers for Common Sense.

7. Tangled education savings subsidies: At least 11 separate incentives in the code encourage taxpayers to save for higher education, according to the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report. All have different eligibility requirements, definitions of terms, income thresholds, and other features. In Congressional testimony last summer, the GAO noted that in 2008 (the latest year data were available) some taxpayers didn’t take the higher education deductions they were eligible for because of their complexity. The Taxpayer Advocate report recommends consolidating the incentives and harmonizing definitions to make it easier for taxpayers to determine eligibility and calculate benefits.

8. The home price inflation incentive: The mortgage interest deduction allows homeowners to deduct interest on up to $1.1 million in mortgage debt. Though the deduction’s rationale is encouraging homeownership, in a report last fall, the GAO noted that it’s more likely prospective buyers are figuring the deduction into the prices they’re already willing to pay for homes, pushing their costs up artificially, says the agency. Many economists and the Simpson Bowles Commission have proposed at least modifying the interest deduction so that it benefits middle- to lower-income taxpayers, who are those most likely to actually need help buying a home. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, has proposed a number of options, including converting the deduction to a tax credit and lowering the current $1.1 million cap to $500,000.

9. Overlapping retirement savings tax incentives: Sixteen separate incentives are jammed into the code to encourage taxpayers to save for retirement, notes the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report. All have different rules about eligibility, contribution limits, the taxation of contributions and distributions, and so forth. So for example, a single taxpayer earning under $28,750 can get both a tax deduction and a tax credit for an IRA contribution—the regular IRA deduction, plus a tax credit called the Saver’s Credit, worth up to $1,000. But a 2012 survey found that less than 20 percent of people had heard of the Saver’s Credit—little wonder with so many choices to keep track of. The Tax Policy Center recommends combining the existing options into fewer alternatives—that would make workers’ choices easier and cut the cost of administering so many duplicative rules, the center says.

10. Gimmicky tax sunsets: Congress increasingly passes tax subsidies that are time limited to make their long-term costs to the government look artificially lower, says the National Taxpayer Advocate’s report—the number of these sunsetting subsidies grew from about 21 in 1992 to more than a hundred at the end of 2011. But they make it hard for taxpayers and businesses to plan since its often unclear whether Congress will extend them. Dozens were set to expire before the fiscal cliff deal at the end of 2012, like the numerous energy-related incentives and a deduction for school expenses teachers pay out of pocket."
Mar 28 2019,The economy is growing. Democrats want to know who’s benefiting.,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/28/18285689/schumer-gdp-growth-economy-carolyn-maloney,"The United States economy grew by 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter last year, according to updated numbers released by the government on Thursday. Congressional Democrats are renewing their push to figure out if that growth is touching ordinary Americans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM), and Joint Economic Committee Vice Chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) on Thursday sent a letter to Bureau of Economic Analysis Director Brian Moyer asking him to provide a breakdown of economic growth for different income groups. This is the continuation of efforts the lawmakers began last year attempting to highlight income inequality in America.

“Income inequality in the United States has increased dramatically over the last 40 years, with economic gains increasingly concentrated among the most affluent. By contrast, the majority of Americans have seen incomes and wages stagnate, even as the most closely watched measure of our nation’s economic health, Gross Domestic Product, paints a rosier picture,” Schumer and Maloney wrote.

They argued that relying only on top-line GDP growth “fails to provide a fully accurate assessment of our nation’s economic condition, particularly with respect to income growth for workers.”

Schumer and Maloney pointed to language attached to Congress’s 2019 spending bill that “encourages” the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which releases quarterly GDP numbers, to report how growth is distributed along the income scale.

Per legislation put forth by Schumer and Heinrich last year, the Measuring Real Income Growth Act of 2018, and a parallel bill Maloney put forward in the House, the bureau would have to put together distributional measures of economic growth to be released with quarterly and annual GDP reports.

The language in the appropriations bill doesn’t require the bureau to actually do the calculation, so Schumer and Maloney’s letter is basically a forceful suggestion. They’ve asked Moyer to respond by April 11.

The idea here is to see how economic growth is — and isn’t — benefiting everyone

A recent Urban Institute survey found that last year 40 percent of American families struggled to meet at least one of their basic needs, including buying food, paying medical bills, or covering utility bills, rent, or mortgage. But those gaps don’t show up in official measurements like the GDP, which measures growth in the overall economy.

What Democrats are pushing for is for the BEA to produce a new metric, the “income growth indicator,” to be reported quarterly and annually with GDP numbers starting in 2020 that would show who is and isn’t benefiting from economic growth.

There’s some disagreement about how this would actually work: The bureau would have to come up with a way to measure and report inequality, for example. And some experts question whether it’s really necessary. But proponents hope it will draw more attention to income inequality in America and perhaps even get policymakers to act.

“We spend a lot of time here in the United States and other countries trying to measure what economic success looks like,” Heather Boushey, chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth think tank, said of the Schumer-Heinrich proposal last year. “What really matters is what does [GDP growth] look like for people? For families? Is that growth translating?”

Producing such statistics would require some legwork. Right now, the best information the government has comes from reports from the Current Population Survey and Congressional Budget Office and tax return data from the IRS. But that data is reported separately from the numbers we think of as indicating economic health.

The census’s income and poverty report, for example, doesn’t capture the richest Americans, and the CBO’s report doesn’t come out regularly. (The best publicly accessible data combining economic growth and income inequality is from researchers.)

Last year, I put together an explainer on Schumer and Heinrich’s proposal and how it could pan out. Some experts I spoke with were skeptical.

Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard University and director of economist studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, expressed doubts that such a measure was really necessary or would make sense to calculate.

“If the government starts mandating this kind of reporting, it raises a bunch of hard issues, since the ‘right’ measure of inequality is not so obvious. Do we examine inequality across individuals? Or families?” he said. “Seems to make a difference. Do we adjust for government transfers and taxes? Also seems to make a difference.”

Dean Baker, an economist at the progressive-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, also expressed doubts. Current income data from the census and IRS is limited and retrospective, and fielding new surveys would be difficult and, initially, perhaps inaccurate.

“I’m just not sure this is at all helpful,” he said. “It might be better to get an official release on something like the tax data when it becomes available with a year or so lag.”

If the BEA were to start to show how economic growth affects different income groups, it wouldn’t directly solve any problems, but it would likely draw attention to the growing problem of income inequality in America.

It’s true that the US is in the midst of a long economic recovery — but it’s also true that not everyone is experiencing that growth equally. The US economy grew by 2.9 percent in 2018 (still short of President Donald Trump’s 3 percent goal), but that wasn’t spread evenly across all Americans.

In a speech to party cadres containing some of the boldest pro-market rhetoric they have heard in more than a decade, the country’s new prime minister, Li Keqiang, said this month that the central government would reduce the state’s role in economic matters in the hope of unleashing the creative energies of a nation with the world’s second-largest economy after that of the United States.

On Friday, the Chinese government issued a set of policy proposals that seemed to show that Mr. Li and other leaders were serious about reducing government intervention in the marketplace and giving competition among private businesses a bigger role in investment decisions and setting prices. Whether Beijing can restructure an economy that is thoroughly addicted to state credit and government directives is unclear. But analysts see such announcements as the strongest signs yet that top policy makers are serious about revamping the nation’s growth model.

“This is radical stuff, really,” said Stephen Green, an economist at the British bank Standard Chartered and an expert on the Chinese economy. “People have talked about this for a long time, but now we’re getting a clearly spoken reform agenda from the top.”"

Sep 06 2013,Jobs Report: The Obama Economy Continues Sputtering,Townhall,right,http://townhall.com/tipsheet/kevinglass/2013/09/06/august-jobs-report-n1693042,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics came out with the government's estimates of economic performance for August today. The news is, as it has been for a long time, mediocre. BLS estimated 169,000 jobs were added in August and the unemployment rate dipped to 7.3%.

That sounds mediocre, and it is. Economic forecasters were hoping for much better. The overall situation might be worse than those top-line numbers suggest.

BLS revised its estimation of previous months - they now think that the American economy added 74,000 fewer jobs in June and July than they had initially estimated. That's some of the biggest news here. July had been reported at 162,000 jobs added, and BLS revised that down to a positively pathetic 104,000 jobs. Additionally, the labor force participation rate fell again to a level not seen since the '80s. This continues the trend that has been ongoing for a long time:

The Bureau of Labor Statistics keeps statistics on the labor force participation rate, the ratio of the total workforce to total employment-age Americans. Since the economic crisis, the participation rate has dropped from 66.4% to 63.4%.

Overall, the growth of the labor force beat population growth, but not by much. The labor force participation rate is now at 63.2%. Additionally, government employment grew by 17,000 jobs - but that was driven at the state level. Federal government employment was unchanged in August.

On the plus side, the growth in part-time workers slowed. Those who were employed part time for economic reasons fell while those employed part time for noneconomic reasons grew only very slightly. The economy is hopefully tapping the breaks on the growth in part-time work. As noted before, though, the trend downward for the size of the labor force continues to be troubling. There may be workers who were employed part-time who simply gave up attempting to participate in the economy.

The Federal Reserve is scheduled to ""taper"" their current regime of monetary stimulus if they project that the economy continues improving. It's unclear if this jobs report will be sluggish enough to cause Fed chariman Ben Bernanke to re-think the tapering strategy."
Aug 29 2013,Economy Was Stronger Than Thought In Second Quarter,NPR (Online News),left,http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/08/29/216783905/economy-was-stronger-than-thought-in-second-quarter,"Economy Was Stronger Than Thought In Second Quarter

The U.S. economy expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday.

The new estimate was a sharp upward revision from the bureau's initial report on growth in the spring. A month ago, BEA thought gross domestic product had expanded at just a 1.7 percent annual rate from the end of March through June.

Stronger-than-thought growth could mean that the Federal Reserve, which has been watching for the right moment to begin reducing its efforts to give the economy a boost, will decide that the time has come. Investors' concern about what might happen if the Fed does start to scale back its huge bond-buying program are one reason financial markets have been nervous in recent weeks.

Of course, if traders decide that good news about the economy is ... well, good news ... that might give financial markets a boost.

Behind the upward revision in GDP: U.S. firms exported more goods than previously thought.

Bloomberg News analyzes the news and writes that:

""The improvement is consistent with projections that the U.S. has been able to weather the fallout of government budget cuts and higher taxes and is poised to pick up once those restraints fade. Gains in employment and home prices that are shoring up confidence signal households will sustain spending, the biggest part of the economy. "" 'The economy is doing fine,' said Brian Jones, a senior U.S. economist at Societe Generale in New York, who projected a 2.5 percent gain in GDP. 'It is going to weather the sequestration. Growth will accelerate in the second half.' ""

The second-quarter's 2.5 percent pace was the fastest rate since third-quarter 2012's 2.8 percent. Growth accelerated from a scant 0.1 percent pace in fourth-quarter 2012 and a weak 1.1 percent pace in the first quarter of this year. A year earlier, in second-quarter 2012, GDP grew at juts a 1.2 percent annual rate.

On Sept. 26, BEA will issue one more report about GDP growth in the second quarter of this year. In most cases, though, the bureau's ""third estimate"" isn't revised as much as its second (the one released Thursday).

Also Thursday, the Employment and Training Administration said there were 331,000 first-time claims filed for unemployment insurance last week, down 6,000 from the week before."
Apr 26 2019,U.S. Economy Grew at 3.2% Rate in First Quarter,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/business/economy/gdp-economy.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage,"Reports of the economic expansion’s death appear to have been greatly exaggerated.

The United States economy surged unexpectedly in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said Friday, allaying concern that financial-market volatility and a prolonged government shutdown would cause a slump.

That is good news for President Trump, who is counting on a strong economy to improve his chances for re-election. With investors and consumers alike showing renewed optimism, it is now all but certain that the decade-long expansion will become the longest on record later this year.

“The angst has settled, and the economy has come back,” said Ben Herzon , an economist with Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. “I just can’t point to anything now that’s going to push us into recession.”

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the economy, rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. That is faster than most economists expected, and far better than the dour outlook of early this year, when many forecast that the figure could fall below 1 percent."

Dec 27 2023,"Gov. Kelly announces Kansas economy grows 9.7% in fall 2023, fastest in nation",WIBW 13,center,https://wibw.com/2023/12/27/gov-kelly-announces-kansas-economy-grows-97-fall-2023-fastest-nation,"TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Governor Laura Kelly announced Kansas economy grew by 9.7% in the third quarter of 2023, which was the fastest rate in the nation.

Officials with the Office of the Governor said according to data released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), this improves on an already impressive record of economic growth. In the second quarter, Kansas’ economy grew at the second-fastest rate in the nation at 7.4%.

“This data shows that our efforts to support businesses, create a stable economy, and grow our workforce are paying off,” Governor Kelly said. “Now, Kansas is outstripping the entire nation in economic growth and attracting business investment. Last week, I announced Kansas surpassed $18 billion in business investment since I took office in 2019. It’s clear we have the momentum to continue this trajectory of economic success into 2024 and beyond.”

Officials with the Office of the Governor indicated the Kelly Administration’s work to support the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting industries helped drive this economic growth. While those industries decreased nationally and in 33 other states, they were leading contributions to growth in Kansas.

In addition, Kansas also ranked third in the nation for the growth in personal income, with personal income growing at 4.9% over the 3rd quarter of 2023. Farming, which decreased nationally and in 41 other states, was the leading contributor to the increased earnings in Kansas.

Office of the Governor officials said Kansas’ economic growth is measured by the change in its real gross domestic product (GDP), or the market value of goods and services produced in the state. The second quarter of 2023 included April through June while the third quarter included July through September.

Sep 26 2023,Will the economy finally un-weird itself?,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/2023/9/25/23889590/economy-risks-jobs-government-shutdown-uaw-strikes-student-loans-inflation,"Let’s get this out of the way: the economy is not in bad shape at the moment.

The red hot labor market is cooling off a little, but it remains resilient. It’s the type of thing you’d want to see if the “soft landing” scenario we’re aiming for, where the economy slows down without going into negative territory, is going to happen. Inflation has moderated. Consumers are still hanging in there. The country’s GDP growth for the third quarter is expected to come in quite strong. It actually needs to slow a little bit if inflation is going to come down more. Objectively, you can’t look around and declare, “Yes, we are in the midst of a broad-based recession.”

Still, after the last few years, being nervous is well within many Americans’ rights. Plenty of people have been nervous about the economy for what feels like forever, to the point that it might just be time to accept that at least some level of economic anxiety is a permanent state of being. It’s understandable. The possibility of a recession is scary, inflation is a real bummer, and the thing most people do to exist in the economy — work — is not always super fun. For millions of low-income Americans, economic precarity feels like a fact of life.

There are potential headwinds ahead, as there always are — that’s sort of the name of the game. And there are indicators pointing in negative directions, too. A lot of the excess savings people built up in the pandemic have dissipated, and the programs the government put in place to shore up people’s finances and the economy have by and large dried up. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for well over a year in an attempt to slow the economy down and combat inflation, and it’s not clear whether the full effects of that have been felt. (Remember the whole Silicon Valley Bank collapse from the spring? That was in part the result of Fed rate hikes.)

“It’s a hold-your-breath moment, because you’re just waiting,” said Claudia Sahm, the founder of Sahm Consulting and a former economist at the Federal Reserve. “That’s always the case, but now I think it’s even more reinforced. We’ve been in uncharted territory since 2020, and now it’s seeing if we can get out of it. You can make the case in every direction.”

On the economy, the vibes and realities don’t always match — there’s often a negative bias here, too. People’s individual circumstances vary as well. If you’re a striking auto worker, if your student loan payments are about to come back, or if you got swept up in some of the tech layoffs earlier this year, you’re of course going to be extra worried right now.

“We’ve been in uncharted territory since 2020”

At the macro level, really, things do seem pretty solid. But there are some potential uncertainties to keep in mind.

Strikes, student debt, and the shutdown are an economic “triple threat,” in the bad way

In the short term, there are multiple factors that, while small on their own, could add up to a significant drag on the economy when combined. The United Auto Workers strikes, the pending resumption of student debt payments, and the risk of a government shutdown represent a “triple threat on the economy” at the moment, Greg Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told me in a recent interview. “It’s the combination of the headwinds that can hurt you more than any single isolated incident.”

The UAW strikes cost the economy $1.6 billion in their first week, according to an estimate by Michigan consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, with the impact largely being felt in the places where the union’s strikes are taking place. The longer the strikes go on — and the more the UAW escalates to have more workers walk off the job — the worse the scenario will get. Initially, the UAW struck at just three plants in three states, now it’s escalated to 38 plants across 20 states. That’s expanded its geographic reach as well as its disruption.

It’s a similar situation with a potential government shutdown, which could be just days away if Congress doesn’t strike a deal by midnight on September 30. Some of the economic activity lost during shutdowns will be recovered — government workers who have to forgo their paychecks during that time eventually do get paid. Still, there is damage: the 2018-2019 shutdown, which lasted 34 days, led to $3 billion in permanent lost economic growth, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Regardless, a shutdown isn’t an awesome sign for the state of anything. “The government shutdown is about politics and dysfunction,” Sahm said. “It can’t be good for the economy.”

Student loan repayments, put on pause during the pandemic, are set to become due again in October — for real this time. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that will cost American households some $70 billion each year. That is likely to hit consumer spending somewhat — borrowers will be sending $200 or $300 to the government each month instead of injecting it into the economy. It’s not going to do the economy in.

“Sure, it’s going to have an effect, but I think the magnitudes are not big enough to drive us into a recession unless we’re already on the verge of a recession,” said Constantine Yannelis, an associate professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The White House has laid out an “on-ramp” for student loan repayments to get people back to paying over time that may also soften the economic blow.

There are other short-term negative factors in play as well. Oil prices have risen and, in turn, so has the cost of gas. Mortgage rates are spiking. Most, if not all, pandemic relief programs have sunsetted, including food stamps, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance. Congress allowed the expanded child tax credit to expire as well.

“The pandemic relief programs clearly had effects on demand, clearly had effects on improving balance sheets and debt,” Sahm said. “It’s not hard to think about which direction [the end of the programs] goes.”

Child poverty spiked in 2022 after supplemental programs were ended. Millions of people have lost Medicaid.

The labor market is still good! But it’s slowing down, and the Fed’s still doing its thing.

If everything we were talking about up to this point was sort of small-scale, short-term risk, this is the part where we get to the medium stuff. Keeping with the spirit of the rule of threes, let’s put it into three categories that are top of mind: jobs, inflation, and the Fed.

The overarching headline about the US labor market during the pandemic recovery has been that it’s astonishingly resilient. Many workers were able to get hired, to trade out of bad jobs for better ones, and to join the labor force. Inflation did outpace wage growth for a while, but that’s no longer the case, and those at the bottom end of the income spectrum in particular have really been able to make important gains. In recent months, things have started to moderate. People are quitting their jobs at more normal rates, and job openings have fallen. Job gains have slowed as well. As of the August jobs report, the US was adding an average of 150,000 jobs per month over the past three months. By comparison, at the start of the year, the figure was more than double that.

“The very pillar that is reason for optimism is becoming less solid as we move through the year”

This is all headed in the direction of “normal” territory. The question is whether normal sticks. The downward trend could continue into negative territory, meaning the labor market adds fewer and fewer jobs until we eventually see job losses. “What stops that deceleration?” Sahm said.

“We’re seeing an ongoing slowdown in the labor market,” Daco said. “The very pillar that is reason for optimism is becoming less solid as we move through the year.”

It’s also worth noting that a normal jobs market doesn’t mean an optimal one. The Black unemployment rate has typically remained much higher than the white unemployment rate, though this recent tight labor market has led to historically low unemployment rates for Black workers. If anything, the past few years have shown that we don’t have a great sense of just how good the labor market can get.

Inflation increasing again is another concern. It’s moving in the right direction generally, but the ride is likely to be bumpy. While the hope for the labor market is that it stays close to where it is, the hope for inflation, which is in the 3-4 percent range annually, continues to come down, heading more toward that 2 percent rate the Fed aims for in the long term. What’s more, some of the factors that could contribute to increasing inflation — trade disruptions, rising oil prices — are very much out of the Fed’s hands.

“We’re seeing a lot of political instability in China at the moment and an increasing decoupling between China and the US, and more generally, we’ve entered, since the pandemic, a new era of trade protectionism,” Yannelis said.

“While the Fed will say they care about all inflation, they can do nothing about [oil and gas price] inflation,” Sahm said. “That’s global demand, that’s global politics.”

Speaking of the Fed, that’s where another wild card comes in — or, at least, wild-ish. In September, it left interest rates unchanged in a sign that it’s relatively optimistic about where the economy is headed. It’s expected to raise interest rates once more this year and has also indicated it will keep rates higher for longer in 2024. It’s a sign the Fed seems to believe the economy can withstand higher rates for longer. That means borrowing costs will likely stay high, something many consumers, businesses, and investors may not love. Still, the economy is unpredictable, and economic forecasts are just that — forecasts.

It’s still not clear if we’ve seen the full fallout of the actions the Fed’s already taken. “I’m still in the camp that we haven’t seen the effect of all the Fed’s interest rates, and frankly, I’m most concerned with the risks in the financial sector,” Sahm said, pointing to the role higher interest rates played in Silicon Valley Bank’s implosion. That being said, the Fed hiking interest rates so much thus far could have pushed the country into a recession, and it didn’t. “With a recession, typically there’s been a shock. The Fed rapidly raising interest rates by over 5 percentage points, that could have been a shock, but it’s not like we rolled right into a recession,” she said.

Qian Wang, an economist at Vanguard Group, said she sees a potential problem where the Fed gets stuck between a rock and a hard place as different parts of the economy move in different directions. “I think the biggest risk is that the Fed may get into a dilemma and inflation may pick up actually again and economic growth may weaken and slow down, so that literally makes a soft landing impossible,” she said.

To be sure, there are all sorts of scenarios that could play out. Yannelis pointed to “tail-risk nightmare scenarios” in the long term (or, really, whenever) that could obviously do big damage to the economy — artificial intelligence getting out of control, a disastrous 2024 election where people en masse refuse to accept the results, large-scale confrontation between global powers, like Russia and NATO. It’s important to point out here that these are really unlikely scenarios. Also, if there is a global nuclear war, it’s not really going to matter what mortgage rate your local bank is offering.

Maybe it’s just time to embrace economic anxiety acceptance

Now that I’ve spent a lot of this story bumming you out a little, I want to emphasize here that there really are plenty of reasons for optimism about the economy — on jobs, consumer spending, and growth. The soft landing scenario seems very much possible, though most economists and policymakers aren’t rushing to call this a definitive win.

“We do feel that a soft landing is not impossible, of course, but we don’t think that’s our baseline scenario,” Wang said, noting Vanguard’s base case is a recession within the next 18 months. “The market sentiment is getting too high.”

“We have not soft landed, we are still in the landing process”

“Objectively, the economy’s feeling pretty good, but it’s vulnerable, because it’s still dealing with high interest rates. And you throw in these headwinds, and I don’t think we’re home free yet,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “You can’t declare mission accomplished yet. We have not soft landed, we are still in the landing process.”

The US economy has been claimed to be near a recession for months and months now, and one doesn’t appear to have happened yet. There will very likely be a downturn again at some moment, because recessions, historically, have been a fact of economic life. It’s fair to say that right now, the economy looks quite strong and resilient, and there are also risks. Whether those risks will add up to something impactful isn’t something anyone can definitively declare."
Jan 09 2024,US farmers warn Biden’s economy spells ‘destruction’ ahead of 2024 Iowa caucuses,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/us-farmers-warn-bidens-economy-destruction-2024-iowa-caucuses,"With the Republican Iowa caucuses just one week away, Hawkeye State farmers are revealing how the 2024 presidential election will serve as a pivotal moment for the economy and agricultural industry.

""I'm afraid if we keep heading down this path, we've got a lot of destruction ahead,"" fifth-generation farmer Rick DeGroote told FOX Business’ Grady Trimble.

U.S. Department of Agriculture data estimates that production costs for farmers increased by about $15 billion in 2023. Additionally, American corn producers reportedly worry the Biden administration’s electric vehicle push will drastically reduce demand for corn-based ethanol, which is used to power gas engines.

Although Iowa’s farmland stays mostly barren in the dead of winter, its political landscape is anything but, as DeGroote represents one of many industry leaders who feel at a crossroads in the upcoming election.

U.S. COWBOYS TRAVEL TO ISRAEL TO HELP FARMERS HARVEST THEIR CROPS: THEY HAVE A GOD-GIVEN ‘RIGHT’ TO THIS LAND

""Most of our corn goes to ethanol, and without that, that would cripple the farm economy,"" DeGroote added.

""It seems like that we are an easy scapegoat for a population that is looking for someone to blame, and knowing full well that we really don't have a very big voice,"" said Kyle Mehmen, of MBS Family Farms.

For the first time in its 55-year history, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC) reported in its annual Winter Reliability Assessment that energy policy is one of the top threats to the U.S. power grid due to the Biden administration's green agenda. It also said the key factors contributing to the risk are increasing demand for electricity to power things like electric vehicles, decreasing generation due to the premature closures of coal and gas-fired power plants.

When Trimble polled a focus group of six Iowa farmer-constituents, four Republicans answered that they stand undecided over which candidate to support as the party’s presidential nominee.

""I want to see strong economic policy for our country. The issues that face my farm are no different than any other business. It’s inflation, it’s labor, it’s taxation, so that’s what I’m looking at in the candidates this year,"" sixth-generation farmer from Jesup, Ben Riensche also told Trimble.

Husband-wife farming team Eric and Krystal Doolittle claim they've been dissatisfied with the past four years, and want to see someone ""other than Biden"" be elected to office.

""I am a person that wants to pick the president based on their policies, and being in the [agriculture] industry, it’s really easy to see how policies impact us directly,"" Krystal said, while her husband listed ""rising interest costs that we’re undergoing now, and the massive amount of inflation.""

The latest FOX Business poll indicated former President Donald Trump leads by 34 points amongst surveyed Iowa Republicans, and that 52% of likely GOP caucus-goers support Trump , putting him over 50% for the first time. Next, it’s Ron DeSantis at 18% and Nikki Haley at 16%.

The Fed was widely expected to stand pat today, and it did. Investors also were watching to see whether Fed chair Jay Powell would hint at the central bank’s outlook on a potential rate hike at its December meeting. He insisted the decision will be based on data—two more inflation readings, two more labor market readings—and not prejudged.

“This has been a resilient economy, it’s been surprising in its resilience,” Powell told reporters after the Federal Open Market Committee finished its November meeting.

The big question for markets and citizens remains the same: How soon will the Fed be prepared to cut rates? You’ll be shocked to hear that some economists think the economy is still too hot and liable to see prices increase too quickly, while others fret that the Fed is in danger of overshooting and plunging the economy into a deep recession.

Powell says he and his colleagues haven’t even gotten to the question of cuts yet; he still isn’t sure whether monetary policy is tight enough to keep driving inflation downward. The Fed’s answer is to wait and watch, but there are still dangers in the monetary policy board’s apparent plans to keep interest rates where they are for longer.

The economy is sending mixed signals, although perhaps less mixed than in recent months. On the plus side: Third-quarter GDP growth shot through the roof at a 4.9% annualized rate, and the job market remains robust, while inflation continues to trend lower despite slight boosts in recent reports. The Fed’s preferred inflation index, based on government analysis of household spending, rose 3.4% year-over-year in September. That’s higher than the Fed’s 2% target, but far less than the 6.5% increase in prices seen in September 2022.

What about the other data, particularly sentiment and survey data that asks businesses and consumers about their views and plans? Those figures have diverged from the actual economic indicators—perhaps a sign that non-economic grumbles are leaking into questions about finances—but even consumer sentiment as measured by the University of Michigan is starting to turn around.

Without a recession, the US economy is nearly in uncharted territory

Much-mocked recession predictions from economists like Harvard’s Larry Summers relied on historical data. In one 2022 working paper, Summers cited 11 historical instances where average wage inflation was 5% and the unemployment rate was below 5%—each time, there was a recession within two years. He also cited eight instances where average wage inflation was above 5% and unemployment was below 4%—again, each time there was a recession within two years.

The US economy tripped the first wire in the fourth quarter of 2021, and the second in the first quarter of 2022. That means if the US makes it through March 2024 without a recession, we’ll be in uncharted territory. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast suggests we might make it at least part way, predicting 1.2% real growth in the last quarter of this year. The specter of growth petering out before the Fed cuts rates is still hovering over all of this, though Powell said today that the central bank’s staff isn’t forecasting a recession.

The presumption behind these recession predictions is that to fight inflation, the Fed would have to raise interest rates high enough to cause a recession. Instead, the economy has been robust even with higher interest rates and inflation has fallen without too much pain for the average American, at least thus far. That might suggest that supply problems related to the pandemic had a big role to play in high inflation; indeed, for the first time in 35 months, US manufacturers are no longer reporting shortages of silicon chips.

The Fed’s interest rate increases have not been without impact

Though the Fed has yet to truly diminish demand in the US, the effects of higher interest rates are starting to crimp investment. That’s notable in the housing market, where 30-year mortgage rates above 7% have slowed new homes under construction, but also in all kinds of businesses that depend on credit, particularly in large green energy projects like building wind turbines. High interest rates also are weighing on the US government, which is assuming a much larger burden to borrow at a time when deficits are unusually high.

Bond markets have watched all this with caution. Last week’s hot GDP print brought a sell-off of US government debt, leading to a burst of higher yields for longer term US bonds. That could finally end the “yield curve inversion”—the fact that it costs the US government less to borrow money for 10 years than it does for just a month.

That could be interpreted in several ways: Powell says it’s not clear yet if this trend is persistent or just run-of-the-mill market volatility. Bill Gross, the erstwhile Bond King, is expecting a recession before the end of the year and is betting that the Fed will cut rates, making those cheap bonds more valuable. It could simply be a sign of slowing demand for Treasurys, as the US sells more debt and the Fed buys less of it. It might actually be the markets doing the Fed’s job for it, since higher yields mean tighter credit across the economy, and returning the yield curve to its normal slope.

That gets at the Powell’s challenge in these unusual times. The central bank was late to start to reigning in the bucking bronco of the US economy when it started hiking in 2022. But after several years of tightening its hold, it’s not clear whether hanging on or letting go is the safer option."
Oct 30 2023,The Secretive Industry Devouring the U.S. Economy,The Atlantic,left,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/,"Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET on October 30, 2023

The publicly traded company is disappearing. In 1996, about 8,000 firms were listed in the U.S. stock market. Since then, the national economy has grown by nearly $20 trillion. The population has increased by 70 million people. And yet, today, the number of American public companies stands at fewer than 4,000. How can that be?

One answer is that the private-equity industry is devouring them. When a private-equity fund buys a publicly traded company, it takes the company private—hence the name. (If the company has not yet gone public, the acquisition keeps that from happening.) This gives the fund total control, which in theory allows it to find ways to boost profits so that it can sell the company for a big payday a few years later. In practice, going private can have more troubling consequences. The thing about public companies is that they’re, well, public. By law, they have to disclose information about their finances, operations, business risks, and legal liabilities. Taking a company private exempts it from those requirements.

That may not have been such a big deal when private equity was a niche industry. Today, however, it’s anything but. In 2000, private-equity firms managed about 4 percent of total U.S. corporate equity. By 2021, that number was closer to 20 percent. In other words, private equity has been growing nearly five times faster than the U.S. economy as a whole.

James Surowiecki: The method in the market’s madness

Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University who studies corporate finance, told me that if current trends continue, “we could end up with a completely opaque economy.”

This should alarm you even if you’ve never bought a stock in your life. One-fifth of the market has been made effectively invisible to investors, the media, and regulators. Information as basic as who actually owns a company, how it makes its money, or whether it is profitable is “disappearing indefinitely into private equity darkness,” as the Harvard Law professor John Coates writes in his book The Problem of Twelve. This is not a recipe for corporate responsibility or economic stability. A private economy is one in which companies can more easily get away with wrongdoing and an economic crisis can take everyone by surprise. And to a startling degree, a private economy is what we already have.

America learned the hard way what happens when corporations operate in the dark. Before the Great Depression, the whole U.S. economy functioned sort of like the crypto market in 2021. Companies could raise however much money they wanted from whomever they wanted. They could claim almost anything about their finances or business model. Investors often had no good way of knowing whether they were being defrauded, let alone whether to expect a good return.

Then came the worst economic crisis in U.S. history. From October to December of 1929, the stock market lost 50 percent of its value, with more losses to come. Thousands of banks collapsed, wiping out the savings of millions of Americans. Unemployment spiked to 25 percent. The Great Depression generated a crisis of confidence for American capitalism. Public hearings revealed just how rampant corporate fraud had become before the crash. In response, Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws launched a regime of “full and fair disclosure” and created a new government agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to enforce it. Now if companies wanted to raise money from the public, they would have to disclose a wide array of information to the public. This would include basic details about the company’s operations and finances, plus a comprehensive list of major risks facing the company, plans for complying with current and future regulations, and documentation of outstanding legal liabilities. All of these disclosures would be reviewed for accuracy by the SEC.

This regime created a new social contract for American capitalism: scale in exchange for transparency. Private companies were limited to 100 investors, putting a hard limit on how quickly they could grow. Any business that wanted to raise serious capital from the public had to submit itself to the new reporting laws. Over the next half century, this disclosure regime would underwrite the longest period of economic growth and prosperity in U.S. history. But it didn’t last. Beginning in the “Greed Is Good” 1980s, a wave of deregulatory reforms made it easier for private companies to raise capital. Most important was the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which allowed private funds to raise an unlimited amount of money from an unlimited number of institutional investors. The law created a loophole that effectively broke the scale-for-transparency bargain. Tellingly, 1997 was the year the number of public companies in America peaked.

From the November 2018 issue: The death of the IPO

“Suddenly, private companies could raise all the money they want without even thinking about an IPO,” De Fontenay said. “That completely undermined the incentives companies had to go public.” Indeed, from 1980 to 2000, an average of 310 companies went public every year; from 2001 to 2022, only 118 did. The number briefly shot up during the coronavirus pandemic but has since fallen. (Over the same time period, the rate of mergers and acquisitions soared, which also helps explain the decline in public companies.)

Meanwhile, private equity has matured into a multitrillion-dollar industry, devoted to making short-term profits from highly leveraged transactions, operating with almost no regulatory or public scrutiny. Not all private-equity deals end in calamity, of course, and not all public companies are paragons of civic virtue. But the secrecy in which private-equity firms operate emboldens them to act more recklessly—and makes it much harder to hold them accountable when they do. Private-equity investment in nursing homes, to take just one example, has grown from about $5 billion at the turn of the century to more than $100 billion today. The results have not been pretty. The industry seems to have recognized that it could improve profit margins by cutting back on staffing while relying more on psychoactive medication. Stories abound of patients being rushed to the hospital after being overprescribed opioids, of bedside call buttons so poorly attended that residents suffer in silence while waiting for help, of nurses being pressured to work while sick with COVID. A 2021 study concluded that private-equity ownership was associated with about 22,500 premature nursing-home deaths from 2005 to 2017—before the wave of death and misery wrought by the pandemic.

Eventually, the public got wind of what was happening. The pandemic death count focused attention on the industry. Journalists and watchdog groups exposed the worst of the behaviors. Policy makers and regulators, at long last, began to take action. But by then, much of the damage had been done. “If we had some form of disclosure, we probably would have seen regulatory action a decade earlier,” Coates told me. “But instead, we’ve had 10-plus years of experimentation and abuse without anyone knowing.”

Something similar could be said about any number of industries, including higher education, newspapers, retail, and grocery stores. Across the economy, private-equity firms are known for laying off workers, evading regulations, reducing the quality of services, and bankrupting companies while ensuring that their own partners are paid handsomely. The veil of secrecy makes all of this easier to execute and harder to stop.

Private-equity funds dispute much of the criticism of the industry. They argue that the horror stories are exaggerated and that a handful of problematic firms shouldn’t tarnish the rest of the industry, which is doing great work. Freed from onerous disclosure requirements, they claim, private companies can build more dynamic, flexible businesses that generate greater returns for shareholders. But the lack of public information makes verifying these claims difficult. Most careful academic studies find that although private-equity funds slightly outperformed the stock market on average prior to the early 2000s, they no longer do so. When you take into account their high fees, they appear to be a worse investment than a simple index fund.

“These companies basically get to write their own stories,” says Alyssa Giachino, the research director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. “They produce their own reports. They come up with their own numbers. And there’s no one making sure they are telling the truth.”

In the Roaring ’20s, the lack of corporate disclosure allowed a massive financial crisis to build up without anyone noticing. A century later, the growth of a new shadow economy could pose similar risks.

The hallmark of a private-equity deal is the so-called leveraged buyout. Funds take on massive amounts of debt to buy companies, with the goal of reselling in a few years at a profit. If all of that debt becomes hard to pay back—because of, say, an economic downturn or rising interest rates—a wave of defaults could ripple through the financial system. In fact, this has happened before: The original leveraged buyout mania of the 1980s helped spark the 1989 stock-market crash. Since then, private equity has grown into a $12 trillion industry and has begun raising much of its money from unregulated, nonbank lenders, many of which are owned by the same private-equity funds taking out loans in the first place.

Meanwhile, interest rates have reached a 20-year high, posing a direct threat to private equity’s debt-heavy business model. In response, many private-equity funds have migrated toward even riskier forms of backroom financing. Many of these involve taking on even more debt on the assumption that market conditions will soon improve enough to restore profitability. If that doesn’t happen—and many of these big deals fail—the implications could be massive.

Joe Nocera and Bethany McLean: What financial engineering does to hospitals

The industry counters that private markets are a better place for risky deals precisely because they have fewer ties to the real economy. A traditional bank has a bunch of ordinary depositors, whereas if a private-equity firm goes bust, the losers are institutional investors: pension funds, university endowments, wealthy fund managers. Bad, but not catastrophic. The problem, once again, is that no one knows how true that story is. Banks have to disclose information to regulators about how much they’re lending, how much capital they’re holding, and how their loans are performing. Private lenders sidestep all of that, meaning that regulators can’t know what risks exist in the system or how tied they are to the real economy.

“Everything could be just fine,” says Ana Arsov, a managing director at Moody’s Investors Service who leads research on private lending. “But the point is that we don’t have the information we need to assess risk. Who is making these loans? How big are they? What are the terms? We just don’t know. So the worry is that the leverage in the system might grow and grow and grow without anyone noticing. And we really don’t know what the effects could be if something goes wrong.”

The government appears to be at least somewhat aware of this problem. In August, the SEC proposed a new rule requiring private-equity fund advisers to give more information to their investors. That’s better than nothing, but it hardly addresses the bad behavior or systemic risk. Nearly a century ago, Congress concluded that the nation’s economic system could not survive as long as its most powerful companies were left to operate in the shadows. It took the worst economic cataclysm in American history to learn that lesson. The question now is what it will take to learn it again."

Jan 11 2024,Inflation ticked up to 3.4% in December while Americans grow more confident about the economy,NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/inflation-rate-december-2023-falling-prices-impacting-consumers-rcna133050,"Inflation climbed from 3.1% to 3.4% in December, a sign the Federal Reserve will continue to have to wrestle consumer price growth down to its desired 2% level.

Forecasts had been for a reading of 3.2%.

On a monthly basis, inflation hit 0.3%, while core inflation, which strips away the more volatile costs of food and energy, was 3.9%, down from 4% in November but ahead of forecasts for a reading of 3.8%.

The biggest contributors to December's pickup in price growth were housing and shelter costs, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics said accounted for more than half of the gain. On a year over year basis, total shelter costs increased 6.2%, while rents increased 6.5%.

""As long as shelter inflation remains stubbornly elevated, the Fed will keep pushing back at the idea of imminent rate cuts,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, in a note to clients following the Thursday data release.

Yet economists also said these increases are unlikely to last given other real-time measures of housing costs showing cooling price growth. In its most recent rental report, the real estate group Redfin said the median asking rent in the U.S. fell for the third-straight month in December to $1,964.

The decline came as landlords grappled with rising vacancies due to a post-pandemic building boom, Redfin said.

Indeed, there are signs consumers are starting to feel better about the economy — even though, to many of them, the prices they're experiencing still don't feel like a big improvement.

After two years of breakneck inflation that sent the cost of everyday goods and services surging, 2023 experienced a meaningful slowdown in price growth: the December 3.4% reading is down from the 6.4% growth seen in December 2022.

Thursday's reading is still above the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2%, and prices in most cases aren't actually reversing. As a result, the shell shock of the past 24 months for consumers is still wearing off.

“The good news is the rate of inflation has been steadily moderating and moving closer to the ultimate goal of 2%,” said Greg McBride, a vice president and the chief financial analyst at Bankrate. “The bad news is it doesn’t mean prices are actually falling — just that they’re not going up as fast.”

Two of the categories most affecting consumers — food at home and energy prices — have had more aggressive slowdowns in price growth than many other categories, McBride said. After hitting a high of 13.5% in August 2022, 12-month food price growth slowed to 1.3% in December, the BLS said Thursday.

And gas prices, which surged to almost $5 a gallon on average in June 2022, are now about $3 a gallon.

While Russia’s invasion of Ukraine produced an acute price surge for those two categories in 2021, McBride said their price growth has slowed thanks to a broader slowdown in economic growth — a trend that is likely to continue. The World Bank announced this week that it expects worldwide gross domestic product to hit just 2.4% this year, down from 2.6% in 2023, 3.0% in 2022 and 6.2% in 2021.

Yet, consumers still face everyday prices that are above pre-pandemic levels. White bread, which cost about $1.30 per pound in the winter of 2019-20, now costs about $2 per pound, according to BLS data. Ground beef has increased from about $3.87 a pound to $5.35 a pound over the same period. And a gallon of milk has climbed from roughly $3.20 to about $4.

So even as price growth continues to moderate, consumers are still adapting to a new normal.

“Consumer sentiment is still depressed overall,” said Matt Bush, the U.S. economist at Guggenheim Investments. “While the rate of inflation is slowing down, the absolute level is still really high — consumers are still unhappy with the level of prices.”

There are signs that consumer sentiment is slowly turning around now that wage growth has surpassed the rate of inflation.

Consumer confidence jumped in the final month of last year to its highest level since July. Data released Friday showed employers added 216,000 jobs in December, far more than expected, demonstrating the labor market remains robust even as it cools down.

Against that backdrop, some economists view even potentially concerning trends, like consumers’ ballooning debt burdens, as a sign that people are starting to feel a bit more optimistic as price pressures ease.

“They’re taking on additional debt because they expect to make more money,” said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consulting firm RSM. Consumer debt figures don’t always paint a full picture, in part because wealthier Americans tend to borrow and repay more money at faster rates, he said. But even so, many consumers “have the capacity to pay that debt back” despite higher interest rates on credit cards to mortgages and auto loans.

“In many ways, it’s an expression of confidence,” he added.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's, said that even as wage growth slows, it should still continue to stay above inflation.

For consumers, that means real — if small — gains.

""With each passing month, it gets a teeny bit better,"" Zandi said. He continued: ""There's a slightly brighter hue in terms of people's responses. It's not an event; it’s a process — the feeling that wages are outpacing inflation, that purchasing power [is] improving. That’s what’s happening, but it will take a while to convince to people it’s real and sustainable."""
Jan 10 2024,New Labor Department rule would classify more workers in ‘gig economy’ jobs as employees,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/2790488/biden-rule-gig-economy-workers-returns-to-obama-policies/,"The Biden administration implemented a new rule on Tuesday that will tighten standards for when “gig economy” workers at companies like Uber, Lyft, and Grubhub must be considered employees who are entitled to labor protections rather than independent contractors.

The Labor Department finalized a new rule that will replace a Trump-era standard that narrowed the criteria for classifying workers as employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act.

“Misclassifying employees as independent contractors is a serious issue that deprives workers of basic rights and protections,” acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su said in a press statement. “This rule will help protect workers, especially those facing the greatest risk of exploitation, by making sure they are classified properly and that they receive the wages they’ve earned.”

Contractor status means the people in question would not receive protections related to overtime pay and minimum wages. The new rule has been anticipated by labor advocates but received pushback from gig economy employers such as Uber and Lyft.

“This rule does not materially change the law under which we operate, and won’t impact the classification of the over one million Americans who turn to Uber to make money flexibly,” Uber’s head of federal affairs, CR Wooters, said in a prepared statement.

“This new guidance creates additional complexities and ambiguities for companies and courts alike across the country,” Lyft said in a blog post.

The Department of Labor set relaxed criteria for what is considered a contractor in 2021 by only focusing on two of the six criteria used by the department to determine if a staffer is a contractor. The new rule will now have Labor focus on all six criteria when considering whether an employee is a contractor.

These six criteria include whether the employee can make a profit based on their managerial skills, whether the employee had to invest in the company, the permanence of the relationship, how much control the company has over the employee’s operations, the skill level of the employee, and additional factors.

One complexity will be how it relates to different states. The rules won’t override California’s policies on contractors, for example, which are significantly more restrictive than those of other states.

The rule is also expected to increase costs for some industries, including trucking and retail.

It could also lead to more restrictive policies on contractors in the future. “Depending upon how the political winds blow, this could mark the beginning of much stricter regulation of the gig economy by the [Department of Labor],” Aaron Goldstein, a labor lawyer with Dorsey & Whitney, told the Washington Examiner in an email.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) said on Tuesday that he would introduce a resolution to repeal the rule, arguing that it is an example of the Biden administration “prioritizing unions over Americans who choose to earn a living without participating in a union.”

The policy will go into effect on March 11."

Jan 03 2024,"What's ahead for the US economy and job growth? A peek at inflation, interest rates, more",USA TODAY,left,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/02/2024-economic-outlook-brightens/72055290007/,"The post-COVID-19 economy was finally supposed to stop defying gravity and topple into a recession this year.

Instead, the stock market is roaring on the growing belief that the Federal Reserve is on track to wrestle down inflation without causing a downturn, a rare feat known as a “soft landing.”

To be sure, growth is expected to slow amid the delayed effects of the Fed’s aggressive interest rate hikes, the depletion of households’ excess pandemic savings and a pullback in federal government spending.

But other factors are likely to keep the economy afloat, forecasters say, including near-record home and stock prices, a further easing of inflation to or near the Fed’s 2% goal and the central bank’s tentative plans to cut interest rates more sharply than previously anticipated.

“2023 was a very good year,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. “2024 will just be a good year.”

Will the Fed lower interest rates in 2024?

A flurry of developments in recent weeks has brightened the outlook. The Fed said it’s probably done hiking rates to fight inflation and is penciling in three rate cuts in 2024, a strategy that would lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Inflation has slowed more dramatically than expected, validating the Fed’s turnabout.

And a stock market that was already surging on an improved inflation picture rocketed higher after the Fed’s pivot.

“It was like pouring gasoline on a fire that was already burning,” Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist of BMO, wrote in a note to clients.

What will the economy be like in 2024?

Forecasters expect the economy to grow 1.3% this year, down from a projected 2.4% in 2023 but above their 0.7% estimate in July, according to a survey by Wolters Kluwer Blue Chip Economic Indicators. Meager gains in the first half of the year should give way to stronger output by fall as the Fed slices rates further, forecasters say.

The 3.7% unemployment rate – modestly above a 50-year low − is projected to rise to 4.2% by the end of 2024, well below economists’ 4.8% estimate a year ago.

Keep in mind the Wolters Kluwer poll was conducted in early December, before the Fed news on Dec. 13.

Some top economists have since revised their estimates. Richard Moody, chief economist of Regions Financial, has bumped up his GDP growth forecast to 1.9% from 1.6%. Zandi, who says he always believed inflation would retreat and the Fed would shift its stance, is sticking to his 1.8% prediction.

GDP growth of just under 2% is far from robust but it would be close to the decent 2% average in the decade before the pandemic. Normally, a big drop in inflation requires a dramatically cooling economy as softer consumer and business demand leads companies to lower prices and employees to accept smaller pay raises.

But nothing has been normal about the post-pandemic economy, which vaulted 5.8% in 2021 as it emerged from the COVID-19 recession. The boom came with product and worker shortages that sent prices soaring. But inflation is now easing as those supply driven troubles unwind – even without a big drop in demand. Economist Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics calls the development “almost unprecedented.”

What are the top economic threats?

There are risks.

Inflation could fall more gradually than expected, prompting the Fed to keep its key rate higher for longer. That could hamper growth and possibly even nudge the nation into recession or ""stagflation,"" a toxic mix of a weak economy and high inflation, Ashworth says. The delayed impact from the Fed’s 5.25 percentage points in rate hikes since early 2022 – the most in 40 years – could hobble the economy more than believed.

And global shipping snarls resulting from military conflict in the Red Sea could push prices still higher.

But there’s also a chance that inflation tumbles more rapidly, spurring the Fed to trim rates sooner and faster so that inflation-adjusted rates don’t increase, Goldman Sachs says. Futures markets are forecasting six quarter-point rate cuts in 2024, double the Fed’s estimate.

“We see the upside and downside risks as balanced,” Moody of Regions says. “Previously, we saw the downside risks as dominant.”

In other words, an economy that sizzles again now appears just as likely as one that slumps.

How different parts of the economy are likely to perform in 2024:

Consumer spending

American shoppers have more than done their part to sustain an economy fueled mostly by their purchases. But their pent-up demand from the pandemic is fading and their savings from federal stimulus checks and hunkering down at home are dwindling, Moody says, especially for low- and middle-income consumers.

Those households also have built up record credit card debt to cope with high prices, curtailing their spending even as banks tighten lending standards, says Gregory Daco, chief economist of EY-Parthenon.

Meanwhile, Daco says, job and wage growth are set to slow as the economy cools, providing consumers less cash to spend. High interest rates also should constrain spending, at least until the Fed starts cutting.

But there are also encouraging signs.

Average annual wage growth is set to fall from 4% toward the Fed’s 3.5% target, but inflation will likely come down even more rapidly, Zandi says. That, he says, should give households more purchasing power.

And recently strong growth in productivity – or output per worker – could allow employers to keep doling out healthy raises without hurting profits, Zandi says.

Although low- and moderate-income Americans are squeezed, higher-income consumers have more pandemic savings and are benefiting from near-record home and stock prices, Zandi says, making them feel wealthier and prompting them to splurge. The top third of income earners account for nearly two-thirds of overall spending while the bottom third make up a tenth, Zandi says.

The bottom line?

Consumer spending should rise 1.4% in 2024 following 2.2% growth last year, according to the Wolters Kluwer survey. Zandi expects a stronger 2% gain.

Job growth

Slower consumer spending and a cooling economy should reduce average monthly job gains from a projected 216,000 in 2023 to just 53,000 this year, according to Zandi.

Moody and Goldman Sachs are more sanguine, predicting monthly additions will average about 100,000 – enough to keep the 3.7% unemployment rate from rising.

Zandi agrees there’s a chance payroll growth could be stronger if immigration stays robust instead of declining as expected. That would continue to boost the labor supply and hiring while keeping a lid on pay increases and inflation.

Some hot industries plan to hire lots of workers this year.

Point in Time Studios, a video production company that specializes in virtual reality and 3D animation, expects sales to grow 75%, in part, because of the artificial intelligence frenzy, says company President Rami Kalla. He says the company, based in Tempe, Arizona, will add up to 10 employees to a staff of 25.

And Healthy Technology Solutions, which provides computer systems and services to hospitals and high-end builders, will add four or five employees to its 12-person staff, says Leo Bletnitsky, president of the Las Vegas-based company.

“When all the (large) tech companies were laying people off, it made (job candidates) a lot more available,” he says.

But Robert Brill, CEO of Brill Media, a Los Angeles-based digital advertising company, says sales were down the past two years after soaring in 2021. Higher borrowing costs, he says, have made many businesses wary of taking on new projects.

“I think companies are becoming way more frugal,” Brill says, noting he expects that to change when the Fed lowers rates. For now, he has no plans to add to his 20 staffers.

Inflation

Morgan Stanley reckons the Fed’s preferred core inflation measure, which strips out volatile food and energy items, will fall to 2.4% by the end of the year, from 3.2% in November and a high of 7% in mid-2022. Ashworth predicts it will drift close to the Fed’s 2% target by mid-year, prompting officials to start shaving rates in March.

But Morgan Stanley says rent hikes, the largest contributor to inflation, will fall slowly, keeping inflation elevated longer and delaying the Fed’s first rate cut to June.

Government spending

The Biden Administration’s sweeping legislation to encourage infrastructure, green energy and computer chip development in the U.S. has pumped billions into the economy. But spending cuts are expected in 2024 as part of Congress’s November deal to avert a government shutdown.

Zandi expects a 4% decline in non-defense spending following a 4.8% rise in 2023.

Business investment

While high interest rates will likely dampen business capital spending in the first half of 2024, falling Fed rates could spark a rebound later in the year, economists say.

Broadly, businesses will invest in equipment and structures to the extent consumers keep buying their products and services, Zandi says.

He expects business investment to rise but at less than half of 2023's 4.4% pace.

Housing

Single-family housing starts were weak last year, mostly because of mortgage rates that approached 8%.

But rates recently fell below 7%. And with existing homeowners reluctant to sell because they would have to buy another house at a much higher mortgage rate, demand for new homes is strong.

After hurting economic growth last year, housing should provide a boost in 2024, says Gus Faucher, chief economist of PNC Financial Services Group."
Jan 09 2024,"""Desperate"" Trump says he wants the economy to crash this year — because it will give him a boost",Salon,left,https://salon.com/2024/01/09/desperate-says-he-wants-the-economy-to-crash-this-year--because-it-will-give-him-a-boost,"Donald Trump during a Monday interview with Lindell TV said he hopes for an economic crash because he thinks it will boost his chances of winning the 2024 presidential election. The former president sat down with Lou Dobbs, a former Fox host whose show was axed in 2021 over Dobbs’s intense MAGA fervor. During the interview, Dobbs asked Trump to disclose his plans for how he would “restore primacy” for those who are “fighting for their economic and their real survival.” Trump replied by discussing the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, which would run between Nebraska and Alberta, Canada, though President Joe Biden revoked the pipeline’s permit once he assumed office. “That’s one of just so many different things,” Trump said of the pipeline. “So what we will be doing is we will be drilling, we will be reducing energy, that will bring down inflation, that will bring down interest rates.”

“We have an economy that is incredible,” Trump added. “We have an economy that is so fragile. And the only reason it’s running now is it’s running off the fumes of what we did—what the Trump administration did. It’s just running off the fumes.” He continued: “And when there’s a crash, I hope it’s going to be during these next twelve months, because I don’t want to be Herbert Hoover,” referencing the acting president during the Great Depression. “The one president—I just don’t want to be Herbert Hoover.”

MSNBC host Joe Scarborough took sharp issue with Trump’s remarks about the economy, using them as fodder for why he should not be permitted to once again run for office. ""What you have to love is that he's once again exposed himself to show just how horrific of a public servant he would be,"" the “Morning Joe” host said. ""This is a guy that admitted on television, because he's so focused on himself, that he wants Americans to hurry up and lose their jobs. He wants them to lose their savings, he wants them to lose their 401(k)s. Yes, he wants their retirement accounts to be shattered over the next 12 months. He's that desperate to be elected."" Scarborough continued by asserting that “economists from left to right” will claim the economy is stronger than it has been in recent years. “It's more resilient than they ever expected it to be,” he added. “This economy, you even had conservatives, you had [Wall Street Journal editor] Gerard Baker, no fan of Joe Biden, saying one of the big winners of 2023 last year was the United States economy. It is strong."""

Nov 20 2023,"Snow removal, homelessness and economy among topics at State of the City Address",Alaska's News Source KTUU/KYES,center,https://alaskasnewssource.com/2023/11/21/snow-removal-homelessness-economy-among-topics-state-city-address,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Mayor Dave Bronson gave his annual State of the City speech Monday in downtown Anchorage, addressing a variety of accomplishments and challenges including snow removal efforts, homelessness and the economy.

November’s record-breaking snowfall tested the limits and preparedness of the city’s snow removal crews, Bronson said.

“I know that many of you have been frustrated as the snow has impacted your daily lives, your businesses, our schools and the safety of our roads,” Bronson said. “I hear you loud and clear. I agree with you. Trust me, I really do hear you.”

Bronson had been criticized for moving snow removal assets from residential areas to help with state-maintained roadways. After his speech, the mayor defended this.

“We have to keep the public roads, the high-speed roads, open, “Bronson said. “So people can get food. So the ambulances can get in. Now the ambulances were coming into the neighborhoods and having challenges. I understand that, but why would I plow a neighborhood when you could get out of your neighborhood and out of your driveway and then you get to a major road that’s impassable?”

There are more snow removal resources, and staff, this year compared to last, Bronson said.

“Last year it took us nearly 50 days to get emergency procurement contracts in place so we can get more resources,” Bronson said. “That usually means graters to help with the snow hauling and the snow plowing.”

The mayor’s administration will be having roundtable discussions about this winter’s snow response, so far, and said he’ll be sharing those findings.

Anchorage Assembly Chair Chris Constant said he agreed with a lot of the mayor’s speech and disagreed with other parts.

“When you hear issues relating to limited snow hauling and all the issues we had last week, we had multiple vacancies,” Constant said. “We have 49 vacancies in maintenance and operations, and so it’s no wonder the services can’t be delivered in a timely manner. You know, the mayor’s message in October was, ‘If we get a snow like we had in December, we are ready.’ Well, we had less snow so far in November than we did last December. And so, we weren’t ready. Why? Because we don’t have workers in the jobs.”

The mayor also talked about the homelessness crisis in Anchorage.

“Our initiative to transform the solid waste service admin building to a cold weather shelter have protected numerous Anchorage residents from our unforgiving Alaskan winters and we appreciate the Anchorage Assembly for supporting our recommendation to expand the number of available beds.”

Both the mayor and Constant said they have both been working together on a variety of issues.

“The one area that I think we have the closest alignment with the administration, I think his words were pretty accurate, are issues relating to housing policy,” Constant said. “The Assembly has been very aggressive at working on jumpstarting the housing economy to make sure everybody has a place to live in this town.”

The mayor also talked about 2023 being a record-breaking year for local tourism, calling the topic “the shining star.”

“The heart of our city, downtown Anchorage, is finally emerging from the challenges we face during the pandemic undergoing a renaissance with the establishment of the mushing district and significant business developments that bring energy and vitality to our urban core,” Bronson said. “People are coming back to downtown.”

Alaska’s News Source asked the mayor about safety issues we’ve been hearing about from downtown businesses. Kaladi Brothers Coffee, said in a Facebook post, they’d be closing their downtown location on Dec. 1.

“It’s a big hindrance,” Bronson said. “But we’re still having — we had a very robust year, a very good year. Best tourist year yet.”

Alaska’s News Source also asked Constant about the safety issues downtown.

“There’s no question that, yes we had a record year of tourism, more visitors than ever and we had great revenue that comes from it,” Constant said. “And there’s also no question that there are issues in the community, in the downtown streets, that people aren’t feeling safe. And how we manage that is through a public safety response at this point. We have our outreach. We have our other services relating to people who are unhoused. But we also have issues of crime that are going unmanaged in the downtown.”

In his speech, Bronson also talked about economic development.

“Landmark projects like NorthLink Aviation’s new cargo terminal breaking ground at Ted Stevens International Airport, just several weeks ago and global power players like Amazon building new facilities within the municipality,” Bronson said.

Bronson also talked about his increase in funding to snow removal in the city, in his proposed budget, and increasing pay for the Anchorage Police Department, giving them “the largest pay increase in the history of the municipality.”

The mayor also talked about securing funding to modernize and repair the Port of Alaska.

Anchorage Assembly Vice Chair Meg Zaletel also talked about the mayor’s speech afterward.

“We have some areas of agreement,” Zaletel said. “But what it really doesn’t drill down into is that what’s been keeping the city moving for the past year is the work of the Anchorage Assembly. A lot of the accomplishments that the mayor is taking credit for often are because the Assembly is overriding vetoes or bringing forward legislation. It is not coming from his administration.”

Alaska’s News Source asked the mayor about this criticism.

“We partner on a lot of things,” Bronson said. “But we provide the path forward and they support us. They’re saying things that they do that we support them on too. The Title 21 reforms that, you know, Kevin Cross is working on. That’s really good. I met with Kevin this morning. The contest isn’t as deep as people think.”

Nov 03 2023,How Daylight Saving Time clock changes upend the economy,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/how-daylight-saving-time-upends-economy,"On Sunday, Nov. 5, most of the U.S. will dial back their clocks an hour in order to ""fall back"" to standard time as part of the nation's semi-annual ritual of changing the time.

While much of the analysis surrounding America's twice-a-year clock changes covers the health effects of Daylight Saving Time (DST) – which includes a higher risk of cardiac issues amid disrupted sleep schedules – the economic toll has not received as much focus.

However, research indicates that changing the clock twice a year has adverse impacts on the money side of things that are very real, and the evidence is growing.

A study published last year by researchers from several business schools found that investors and capital market participants are slower to respond to accounting reports in the week after we ""spring forward"" – which falls smack in the middle of earnings season.

""These results are strongest among firms with investors who are more likely to be trading on earnings news and among firms with a less sophisticated investor base,"" the authors wrote. ""Further analysis reveals that our main results are driven by muted reactions to positive earnings surprises, consistent with cognitive impairment and investor pessimism jointly underlying the diminished market response to earnings news.""

FOUR-DAY WORKWEEK GAINING STEAM, RESTAURANT, MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES SAY IT DOESN'T WORK

Another set of business school researchers found that on the Monday following DST, there is a rise in workplace injuries. Not only that, the injuries were more severe (measured by days of work lost due to the injuries), which surged by 67%.

A subsequent study discovered that on the Monday after DST there is a sharp uptick in ""cyberloafing,"" the practice of employees scrolling the internet for non-work-related activities.

There is also evidence the time change leads to an increase in heart attacks, strokes and depression, leading to an increase in health care costs. Even commuting becomes more treacherous and expensive, given that the change to DST has been linked to spikes in car accidents.

YOU CAN'T FIRE THEM, THEY QUIT

Additionally, while DST has been touted as an energy-saving move, a 2008 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that DST actually led to a 1% increase in residential energy consumption by consumers in Indiana – costing households in the state an extra $9 million on their electric bills and resulting in another estimated $1.7 to $5.5 million in ""social costs of increased pollution emissions.""

The actual dollar amount of the collective impact of these factors is tough to pin down, but a Chmura Economics & Analytics study from a decade ago found that the springtime change cost the U.S. economy more than $433 million. As of 2021, Manhattan Institute senior fellow Allison Schrager reported that DST cost the airline industry alone hundreds of millions of dollars.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PROPOSE MAJOR ENERGY AND PERMITTING REFORM PACKAGE

Despite evidence indicating changing the clocks has negative impacts on Americans' health and the economy, the latest effort in Congress to end the practice appears stalled.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been leading a bipartisan coalition for years to make what is currently DST, the new standard time. His ""Sunshine Protection Act"" eliminating the time change passed the upper chamber by unanimous consent last year, but the House never took it up that Congress.

Rubio reintroduced his legislation in March, backed by several senators from both sides of the political aisle, and Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., filed a companion bill in the House. Both bills remain in committees."
Dec 08 2023,"US economy adds 199,000 jobs in November, unemployment rate unexpectedly falls",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-jobs-report-november-2023,"U.S. job growth continued to chug along at a healthy pace in November, suggesting that the labor market remains resilient even in the face of higher interest rates, stubborn inflation and other economic uncertainties.

Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, as striking autoworkers and actors returned to work. That was slightly above the 180,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists.

The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 3.7% after rising for three straight months, driven by a sizable drop in the jobless rate for teenagers.

The report also contained modest downward revisions to job growth at the beginning of fall. Gains for September were revised down by a total of 35,000 jobs to 262,000, the government said, suggesting that the labor market is weaker than it previously appeared. October's gain was unchanged at 150,000 jobs.

WORKERS NOW DEMANDING NEARLY $80K TO START NEW JOB

""Today’s jobs report shows a continued stabilization following the hot summer hiring season, leading to a New Year reset,"" said Becky Frankiewicz, chief commercial officer of ManpowerGroup. ""We’ve anticipated a stabilization, and we’re moving toward it slowly but surely.""

In another show of strength for the economy, average hourly earnings – a key measure of inflation – increased 0.4% for the month and remained up 4% from the same time one year ago. The monthly increase came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% estimate, but the annual figure was in line with expectations.

The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is closely watching the report for evidence that the labor market is finally cooling after more than a year of interest rate hikes. Policymakers voted last month to leave their benchmark rate unchanged for a second straight time to assess the cumulative impact of previous increases.

FED LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED DESPITE STILL-HIGH INFLATION

Many economists believe that the Fed is done with its tightening campaign, although Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that it would be ""premature"" to assume that there will be no more rate hikes – and to speculate on when policy may ease.

Stocks fell after the stronger-than-expected jobs report, with futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.4%.

Ticker Security Last Change Change % I:DJI DOW JONES AVERAGES 38790.43 +75.66 +0.20% I:COMP NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX 16103.44802 +130.27 +0.82% SP500 S&P 500 5149.42 +32.33 +0.63%

The Fed will hold its final two-day meeting of the year next week, and investors are closely watching for clues about what comes next for monetary policy amid signs that inflation is continuing to cool. Pricing suggests that the central bank will cut interest rates as soon as March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, which tracks trading.

""To the extent that the market was expecting four (or more) rate cuts next year, reports like this one are bound to cast shade on that belief and could lead to disappointment in the short run,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance.

Job gains were mostly concentrated in a handful of sectors last month, with the biggest gains in health care (76,800), government (49,000) and leisure and hospitality (40,000). Hiring in manufacturing also trended upward, reflecting the return of UAW workers who had been on strike against General Motors, Stellantis and Ford.

Employment declined in retail trade, reflecting declines in department stores as well as furniture, home furnishings and electronics retailers.

The labor market has remained historically tight over the past year, defying economists' expectations for a slowdown. But there are some signs that cracks are beginning to appear after last year's blistering pace of growth.

""Sorting through the noise, the picture that is emerging is one of a resilient but cooler labor market,"" said Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist. ""Job gains have become less broad-based, labor demand continues to fall, and jobless claims are creeping higher in a sign of softer conditions."""
Oct 26 2023,US economy grew at blistering pace in 3rd quarter,ABC News (Online),left,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/us-economy-expected-grown-blistering-pace-3rd-quarter/story?id=104219612,"U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annualized rate over three months ending in September.

The U.S. economy grew at a blistering pace over three months ending in September, more than doubling growth in the previous quarter and rebuking worries about a possible recession. The robust performance, however, complicates the fight to dial back inflation.

Fresh GDP data released on Thursday, which exceeded economist expectations, reinforces other recent indicators of a strong economy resisting the Federal Reserve's effort to cool price increases with a slowdown.

A blockbuster jobs report earlier this month exceeded economist expectations by nearly twofold. Consumer spending, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of U.S. economic activity, surged in September, according to data released last week.

U.S. GDP grew at a 4.9% annualized rate over the three-month period ending in September, accelerating from a 2.1% annualized rate over the previous quarter.

The surge owed in large part to an increase in consumer spending, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a government agency, said on Thursday.

Consumers hiked spending on services like medical appointments and dinners out, as well as goods like cars and prescription drugs, the BEA said.

Other contributors to the GDP growth included exports and government spending, the agency added.

In keeping with the spending blitz, personal savings diminished during the third quarter, the BEA said. The share of disposable income put away as savings stood at 3.8% in the three-month period ending in September, down from 5.2% in the previous quarter.

Such sturdy performance could nudge the Fed to hike rates at its meeting next week, as it tries to combat persistently high inflation.

Speaking at a luncheon in New York City last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted the unexpectedly strong economic performance in recent months.

""We are attentive to recent data showing the resilience of economic growth and demand for labor,"" Powell said, adding that such growth could ""put further progress on inflation at risk.""

Inflation stands well below its peak last year of over 9%, but progress has stalled in recent months and price growth remains more than a percentage point higher than the central bank's target rate.

Recent economic growth, however, belies an alarm sounded by one of the most important economic indicators: the 10-year treasury yield.

A rapid rise in U.S. government bond yields over recent weeks has elevated borrowing costs for consumers seeking mortgage loans and corporations pursuing funds to expand their business.

The jump in borrowing expenses threatens to slow economic activity in the coming months. Economists expect GDP growth to slow later this year.

The onset of some financial pain is exemplified by the housing market, where the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 8% last week, Mortgage News Daily data shows.

High mortgage rates have dramatically slowed the housing market, since homebuyers have balked at the stiff borrowing costs, and home sellers have opted to stay put with mortgages that lock them into comparatively low rates.

Mortgage applications have fallen to their lowest level since 1996, the Mortgage Brokers Association said earlier this month.

Major housing industry groups voiced ""profound concern"" about rising mortgage rates in a letter last week that urged the Federal Reserve to stop hiking its benchmark interest rate.

Business leaders and policymakers will closely watch when the Fed announces its latest rate-hike decision on Nov. 1.

The central bank expects to raise rates one more time this year, according to projections included alongside a statement last month from the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the Fed's decision-making body on interest rates.

The benchmark interest rate currently stands at a range 5.25% to 5.5%, as a result of a near-historic series of rate increases, also known as credit tightening,

""Given the fast pace of the tightening, there may still be meaningful tightening in the pipeline,"" Powell said last week."
Dec 08 2023,Washington Post Employees Strike Over ‘Record-Level Inflation’ As Paper Insists Economy Is Good,The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/washington-post-employees-strike-over-record-level-inflation-as-paper-insists-economy-is-good,"Hundreds of employees at The Washington Post went on strike Thursday, citing “record-level inflation,” even as the paper itself ran articles insisting that the economy is doing well under the Biden administration.

About 750 Post staffers walked off the job for a 24-hour strike, and they are asking readers not read or engage with any Post content, Axios reported.

“We still lack a contract that keeps pace with record-level inflation and guarantees workers a living wage,” the union, the Washington Post Guild, wrote in its announcement of the strike.

Workers @washingtonpost have been in contract negotiations with our bosses for 18 months. But the company is refusing to pay us what we’re worth or bargain in good faith. So on Dec. 7, we’re walking off the job for 24 hours. pic.twitter.com/GCraL1I0nm — Washington Post Guild (@PostGuild) December 5, 2023

Meanwhile, the Post called it “a miracle year for the U.S. economy” in an editorial published on Saturday, citing falling inflation.

“In many ways, this is the year the economy finally returned to something close to normal. But many people seem to have forgotten what normal looks like after a traumatic few years,” the editorial read.

A Thanksgiving week editorial called for “gratitude” and said that the “typical U.S. family’s cup runneth over” compared to families in places like Ukraine, Gaza, and Afghanistan.

“Voters seem to be giving President Biden little or no credit for the modicum of economic and geopolitical stability over which he has presided,” the editorial said, although it admitted that the cost of housing, fuel, and food “remain elevated compared with their pre-pandemic levels.”

The Post worker strike comes after 18 months of contract negotiations.

The Post is facing a $100 million loss this year. In response, the paper is trying to get rid of 240 jobs, but only about 120 employees have accepted voluntary buyouts, according to Axios.

Last week, The Post warned that it may have to start laying people off if more employees do not accept voluntary buyouts.

Meanwhile, soaring inflation is making life difficult for Americans.

The inflation rate has slowed slightly since 2021, when it spiked to the highest levels in four decades, but many American families say they are struggling more financially now than they did before the pandemic, CBS News polling from September showed.

According to one analysis, Americans need over $11,000 more this year to keep the same standard of living they enjoyed at the beginning of 2021.

Less than half of Americans, 47%, say they cannot live comfortably and have little money left over after meeting their expenses, down from 56% who said so in 2019, according to the polling. Meanwhile, more than half, 53% of Americans, say they either have just enough or cannot meet their expenses, up from 44% in 2019.

Wages have grown, but they have not kept up with inflation, as the Post staffers appeared to acknowledge in their strike announcement.

The average hourly wage has increased 13.6% since January 2021, but inflation has outpaced that growth with a 17% spike, government data shows."

Oct 31 2023,What the 'Great Trucking Recession' is warning us about the economy,Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/what-great-trucking-recession-warning-about-economy,"JOHNSTOWN, Pennsylvania — Two months ago, 30,000 truckers at Yellow lost their jobs when one of the nation’s oldest and largest trucking companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Last week, Convoy, the digital freight broker that was supposed to reinvent the wheel and disrupt the trucking industry in a positive way, also abruptly shuttered its doors.

Rick McQuaide, owner of several freight lines based in Pennsylvania and Florida, says the underlying problem in the trucking industry is a warning sign for our economy. (Courtesy photo)

These kinds of closings by both freight carriers lay bare the uncertain state of trucking, an industry that is an indicator of the mood of the consumer and also the beating heart of our economy.

FORMER FORD CEO PREDICTS ‘MASS ADOPTION’ OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES WILL BE ‘TOUGH’

“In my opinion, this industry is heading in the wrong direction, and when trucking and supply chain freight is heading in the wrong direction, so is the country. I am just not sure that people understand there is a problem,” said Rick McQuaide, who runs a freight company in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, as well as in Florida.

“The damage started when people went on a spending spree during COVID. The government was giving out cash, and people started ordering things in a way they have never done before,” McQuaide explained.

As a result, McQuaide said, new trucks were on the road to meet the consumers’ needs.

Beginning last year, that need started to recede when consumers’ spending spree started to ebb, and, as a result, several different things have happened in the industry, beginning with too many trucks in comparison to the amount of freight that is available.

That, McQuaide said, hits the truckers and truck companies hard: “The economy is slowing from its frenzy, people aren’t buying anymore, which means there are more trucks on the road than there are loads, and it’s forcing the rates down.”

McQuaide said his company’s rates are about 20% lower than last year.

“In other words, last year, we go from Pittsburgh to Allentown, maybe $1,200. This year, we’re lucky to get $900,” he said, adding, “You have more truckers fighting for the same loads that exist now, and that’s driving the rates down.”

Truckers are making less than they did in per-mile peak earnings, McQuaide said.

“Inflation plays a big part of that — at the same time, operating costs are going up.”

McQuaide, who also owns and runs a logistics company that has a series of warehouses holding imports and exports, says the freight recession is real.

“It isn’t just in the trucking world. It is also in air freight and in the rail industries.”

He said he worries not enough people are considering the wider implications of people not spending and truckers not having anything to move.

“This slump is real,” he said flatly.

McQuaide said the trucking industry, or any form of transportation that is moving goods, is the ultimate economic indicator of where the country is heading.

“It provides very valuable insights into the health of where the economy is going and into the mindset of the consumer: Are they spending, or are they feeling uncertain and moving within,” he asked rhetorically.

September data from the government contradicted McQuaide’s concerns, showing a surge in consumer spending — 0.4% to be exact. But economists, like McQuaide, were cautious in reaction.

The Associated Press reported that many households have been spending their money unwisely, tapping into shrinking savings accounts and pulling out the credit cards.

Data also show that when people are spending, they are rethinking forking out money on the big things, such as dishwashers, shiny new stainless stoves, and refrigerators, which backs up what McQuaide is seeing on the freight side.

“That is what we are seeing on the freight side, and that is not a good omen for the U.S. economy. That spending had kept us out of a recession,” he said. “Now that consumers are pulling back, we should be paying more attention to what that means.”"

The auto workers' strike is the latest in a series of labor-management conflicts that economists say could start having significant growth impacts if they persist. So far, the United Auto Workers stoppage has impacted just a small portion of the workforce with limited implications for the broader economy. But it is part of a pattern in labor-management conflicts that has resulted in the most missed hours of work in some 23 years, according to Labor Department statistics. ""The immediate impact of the auto workers strike will be limited, but that will change if the strike broadens and is prolonged,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a client note Monday.

The UAW has taken a somewhat novel approach to this walkout, targeting just three factories and involving less than one-tenth of the workers at the Big Three automakers' membership. However, if things heat up and it turns into an all-out strike, bringing into play the 146,000 union members at Ford, GM and Stellantis, that could change things. In that case, Shepherdson sees a potential 1.7 percentage point quarterly hit to GDP at a time when many economists still fear the U.S. could tip into recession in the coming months. Auto production amounts to 2.9% of GDP. A broader strike also would complicate policymaking for the Federal Reserve, which is trying to bring down inflation without tipping the economy into contraction. ""The problem for the Fed is that it would be impossible to know in real time how much of any slowing in economic growth could confidently be pinned on the strike, and how much could be due to other factors, notably the hit to consumption from the restart of student loan payments,"" Shepherdson said.

Time lost

American workplaces have taken a substantial hit from strikes this year. August alone saw some 4.1 million days lost this year, the most for a single month since August 2000, according to the Labor Department. Combined with July, there were nearly 6.4 million days lost from 20 stoppages. Year to date, there have been 7.4 million days lost, compared to just 636 days total for the same period in 2022. Those big numbers have been the result of 20 large stoppages that have included the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild, state workers at the University of Michigan and hotel employees in Los Angeles. Some 60,000 health care workers in California, Oregon and Washington are threatening to walk out next.

After years of being relatively quiescent, unions have found a louder voice in the high-inflation era of the past several years. ""If you're a corporate CEO and you're not anticipating labor demands, you're not tethered to reality,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, said in an interview. ""After the inflation shock we've gone through, workers are going to demand more money, given the ... likelihood that they've lost ground during this period of inflation. They're going to ask for more money, and they're going to ask for workplace flexibility."" Indeed, recent New York Fed data has shown that workers on average are asking for salaries close to $80,000 a year when switching jobs. In the UAW's case, the union has asked for demanded a 36% raise spread over four years, similar to the pay gains that automaker CEOs have seen.

Inflation impacts

Such potential pay increases have raised the specter that inflation, which has abated recently from 40-year highs, could be stickier as unions fight for higher ground.

But Brusuelas said that prospective 9% annual UAW increases shouldn't have a major impact on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation. Unions have made up a progressively smaller share of the workforce, declining to a record low 10.1% in 2022, about half where it was 40 years ago, according to the Labor Department. Just 6% of private sector workers are unionized, while 33% of government workers are organized. ""Labor strife is going to have a relatively small effect on the overall macro economy,"" Brusuelas said. ""This isn't that big of a deal and it shouldn't come as a shock following such a steep increase in inflation."" Biden administration officials also are not sounding any alarms yet about the potential economic impact. In the immediate term, the stoppage won't show up in the September jobs numbers, at a time when payroll growth is decelerating. ""I think it's premature to be making forecasts about what it means for the economy,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview aired Monday. ""It would depend very much on how long the strike lasts and exactly who's affected by it. But the important point, I think, is that the two sides need to narrow their disagreements and to work for a win-win."""
Sep 15 2023,UAW strike could slam the US economy,Fox Business,right,https://foxbusiness.com/economy/uaw-strike-could-slam-us-economy,"The United Auto Workers officially went on strike against the ""Big Three"" Detroit automakers early Friday, potentially imperiling an already-fragile U.S. economy.

About 13,000 autoworkers began picketing at three assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri after their contract expired at 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday. It marked the first time in the UAW's 88-year history that it walked out on Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — the maker of Chrysler and Jeep — simultaneously.

An extended work stoppage risks causing billions in damage to the economy. A recent analysis from the Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based think tank that specializes in the economic impact of labor strikes, estimated that economic losses from a 10-day work stoppage could cost about $5.6 billion.

UAW STRIKE: LIVE UPDATES

""Even a short strike would impact economies throughout Michigan and across the nation,"" said Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group.

That figure includes manufacturer losses of $989 million and lost direct wages of $859 million. It does not take into consideration strike pay, unemployment benefits, unemployment taxes, income taxes, government spending or settlement bonuses.

UAW STRIKES AT GM, FORD, STELLANTIS PLANTS AFTER NO NEW CONTRACT REACHED

Still, the strikes are limited in scope so far as the UAW seeks to preserve its $825 million strike fund, which would support a walkout for about 11 weeks by the 146,000 union members.

The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) called for a ""swift resolution"" to the strike on Friday morning, warning of potential economic fallout nationwide if the stoppage persists. The walkout threatens to cut vehicle production and drive prices higher at a time when consumers are still grappling with elevated inflation. Deutsche Bank previously estimated that a strike would cost each affected automaker about $400 million to $500 million per week of lost production.

""The impact of this strike will echo far beyond the city of Detroit,"" said NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons. ""American families are already feeling economic pressures from near-record-high inflation, and this will only inflict more pain.""

The main point of contention between the two sides is higher pay, with the union seeking a more than 36% general pay raise for rank-and-file members over four years. That is down from the original demand for a 46% wage increase.

Full-time assembly plant workers at Ford and GM earn $32.32 an hour, while part-timers currently make about $17 an hour. Full-time employees at Stellantis earn $31.77 an hour, and part-time workers earn close to $16 an hour.

The union is also pushing for cost-of-living pay adjustments, an end to forced overtime and increases in pension benefits for current retirees and the restoration of pensions for new hires, among other benefits.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DISCUSSES EMERGENCY AID FOR SMALLER AUTO SUPPLIERS AMID UAW STRIKE THREAT

UAW President Shawn Fain has called the demands the ""most audacious and ambitious list of proposals they've seen in decades.""

""They could double our raises and not raise car prices and still make millions of dollars in profits,"" Fain said. ""We’re not the problem. Corporate greed is the problem.""

Automakers — who have noted they are facing a multibillion-dollar shift to electric vehicles — made a counteroffer that includes far more modest pay increases. GM and Ford offered 20% and Stellantis offered 17.5%.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said Thursday during an interview with CNBC that UAW's proposal could bankrupt the company. Had the contract been in place since 2019, he said, the company would have lost about $15 billion ""and gone bankrupt by now.""

""You want us to choose bankruptcy over supporting our workers,"" Farley said."

After many months of awkward moments and shifting campaign messages, he forcefully and confidently stood alongside President Obama and offered an alternative economic vision to what he called Obama’s “trickle-down government approach.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The two contenders seemed to swap roles Wednesday. Obama was the one who struggled for his footing, scowling on the split screens of millions of television viewers across the nation and often looking like a man who wished he were elsewhere.

Romney came to the debate at the University of Denver with a heavy set of goals, chief of which was to regain ground on the economy. That issue is uppermost among voter concerns and the one that Romney believes provides his greatest advantage.

Romney pressed his case against Obama’s stewardship of a disappointingly weak recovery. He sought to sharpen his own proposals and to soften the perception among voters that he favors the interests of the wealthy over those who are struggling.

""The people who are having the hard time right now are middle-income Americans. Under the president's policies, middle-income Americans have been buried,"" Romney said, echoing a damaging phrase that Vice President Biden used the day before to describe the status of average Americans over the past four years.

Obama, meanwhile, did not make many of the arguments that he and his campaign have used most effectively against Romney. He did not recount the former governor's career in private equity, during which Romney laid off workers, or the secretly taped video in which the Republican nominee told wealthy donors that the 47 percent of Americans who do not pay federal income taxes are dependent on government and see themselves as victims.

The president also left many of Romney’s claims unchallenged. Romney asserted eight times that Obama plans to cut $716 billion from Medicare without noting that the Republican vice presidential nominee, Rep. Paul Ryan (Wis.), shepherded a budget through the House that would do the same thing.

In talking about the economy, which was the primary focus of the debate, Romney delivered none of the ""zingers"" that his team had boasted they were preparing. Each candidate instead dug into the details of his proposals and sharply criticized his opponent's.

And in some areas, they ceded ground to the other, primarily to stress their differences.

Obama said he agreed with Romney that “our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.”

And Romney insisted that he does not want to reduce the share of taxes paid by the wealthy.

“High-income people are doing just fine in this economy,” he said. “They’ll do fine whether you’re president or I am.”

Romney also tried to draw a clearer link between his tax proposal, which heavily benefits the wealthy, and the economic benefit he insists it would provide for everyone else.

“The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done,” he said. “I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.”

The closest Romney came to matching his reputation as an unsentimental, bottom-line-driven executive was when he discussed the budget cuts he would make. The one he singled out was ending the government subsidy for the Public Broadcasting System, which airs the iconic children’s program “Sesame Street.”

“I love Big Bird,” Romney said. “But I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.”

The central premise of the Republican nominee’s campaign has been that voters, disillusioned with Obama’s performance in reviving economic growth, would turn to Romney, who promotes the expertise and experience he gained in the corporate world.

But with less than five weeks to go before Election Day, Romney has been struggling to make a convincing case for himself on that score — and is running about even with Obama on who would better handle the economy.

Where Romney held a seven-point edge over the president on that question among registered voters in an August Washington Post-ABC News poll, the latest survey shows them tied, with 47 percent saying Romney would do a better job and the same proportion opting for Obama.

Meanwhile, the president continues to hold a double-digit advantage when voters are asked which of the two candidates better understands the economic problems people in this country are having. In the most recent poll, 52 percent said it was Obama, while only 39 percent named Romney.

The first debate, which history suggests will draw the biggest audience, amounted to Romney’s best opportunity to change a political dynamic that has been moving against him.

As a result, he was getting an avalanche of advice — some of it conflicting — from the conservative commentariat and from his allies on the sidelines: Be more aggressive, be more personable, attack Obama’s record, offer more details about his plans, stay out of the weeds and stick to big themes.

For Obama, who went into the debates with a slight lead in nearly every poll, the biggest challenge was to avoid a stumble. In past debates, his worst flaws were ones of style, in which he came off as arrogant and aloof, or long-winded and professorial.

Whether the debate did much to win over undecided voters or change anyone’s mind is not likely to become clear for at least a few days. In that time, news organization fact checkers will pick over the assertions that were made, pundits will award style points, and social media will amplify — and perhaps amend — the overall impressions that were left.

In this deeply polarized country, the number of people who are truly wavering in their choice is relatively small. And those who are probably were not among the tens of millions who tuned into the debate, said AFL-CIO political director Michael Podhorzer.

By and large, “they are undecided because those people are not checked into the election,” Podhorzer said. “They’re paying attention to the coverage of the debate and they’re paying attention to what their friends are saying.”"

Jun 03 2012,Opinion: Weak Economy Points to ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Constraints,New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/03/us/politics/obamas-hands-tied-on-weak-economy.html?ref=politics,"WASHINGTON — The bleak jobs report on Friday predictably had heads snapping toward the White House, looking to President Obama to do something. Yet his proposed remedies only underscore how much the president, just five months before he faces voters, is at the mercy of actors in Europe, China and Congress whose political interests often conflict with his own.

That day, Mr. Obama continued his weekly travels around the country, prodding Congressional Republicans to pass his “to-do list” of temporary tax cuts and spending initiatives to help create jobs. The Republicans only mock him, which leaves Mr. Obama free to blame his opponents and their presidential standard-bearer, Mitt Romney. But in doing so, he telegraphs a message of powerlessness that no leader likes to convey — least of all one who ran for office four years ago vowing to bridge Washington’s partisan gulf.

Developments overseas have not helped either. American officials have complained as Beijing began letting its currency devalue again, making its exports cheaper and those from the United States to China more costly. And administration officials, and Mr. Obama himself, have lobbied leaders in Europe for more forceful action to promote growth or at least contain the threat of financial contagion there.

In his weekly address on Saturday, recorded on Friday at a Honeywell International plant near Minneapolis, the president cited the global woes buffeting the economy. But he singled out Congress for rebuke."
Nov 21 2020,Retailers brace as COVID-19 bears down on consumers and economy,Fox News (Online News),right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/retailers-brace-as-virus-bears-down-on-consumers-and-economy,"WASHINGTON — LaTonya Story is every retailer’s worst fear.

With the viral pandemic re-surging through the country and the economy under threat, Story has decided to slash her holiday shopping budget. She'll spend less than $2,000 this season, down from several thousand dollars in 2019. Worried about entering stores, she's buying gifts online and going out only for groceries.

“I want to be conservative,” said Story, a 47-year-old Atlanta resident. “I’m not a scientist, but the best precaution is to stay in place.”

The acceleration of coronavirus cases is causing an existential crisis for America’s retailers and spooking their customers just as the critically important holiday shopping season nears. It's also raising the risk that the economy could slide into a “double-dip” recession this winter as states and cities re-impose restrictions on businesses and consumers stay at home to avoid contracting the disease.

PANIC BUYING OF TOILET PAPER HITS US STORES AGAIN WITH NEW PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS

An anxious consumer is a frightening prospect for retailers as well as for the overall economy. Any sustained recovery from the pandemic recession hinges on consumers, whose spending fuels about 70% of economic growth.

So as the virus rampages across the nation and with holiday sales expected to be weak and heavily dependent on online shopping, retailers are considering extraordinary steps to draw customers.

Some, like Giftery, a small shop in Nashville, Tennessee, are adopting their own safety restrictions. To reduce respiratory particles that could spread the virus, Giftery is asking shoppers to refrain from talking on cellphones.

“It is vital for us to stay open,” said William Smithson, the owner of Giftery, which generates about 35% of its annual sales from the holiday season.

At the same time, some high-end retailers are giving customers extra coddling. Neiman Marcus is letting shoppers book appointments to take virtual tours of its holiday trees and other decorations if they’re too fearful to enter a store. In doing so, the retailer hopes its customers will also get into the spirit of buying gifts.

2020’S BEST BLACK FRIDAY DEALS ARE AT THESE RETAILERS: REPORT

“Business restrictions are increasing, and there will be some economic fallout from that,” said Jim O’Sullivan, an economist at TD Securities. But ""even without authorities announcing new restrictions, individuals are likely to pull back from activity on their own.”

O’Sullivan predicts that the economy won’t grow at all in the final three months of the year — down from his earlier forecast of a 3% annual growth rate in that quarter — and will shrink 2% in the first three months of 2021. He, like most economists, expects a rebound starting in the second quarter once a vaccine is widely distributed.

O’Sullivan’s forecasts assume that Congress will agree on roughly $1 trillion in new stimulus for the economy by early 2021. Yet so far, there’s no sign of progress toward an agreement. More than 9 million people will lose their unemployment aid at year’s end, when two jobless aid programs are set to expire, unless Congress extends them. Consumer spending will likely fall further.

New viral cases doubled in just three weeks, O’Sullivan noted, after the previous doubling had taken six weeks. And as a consequence, many states are adopting or considering new restrictions on businesses. Maryland has limited stores and restaurants to 50% capacity. Retailers in most of California are now capped at just 25%; gyms, restaurants and movie theaters are closed to indoor customers. Illinois and Washington have limited stores to 25% capacity.

Sales at restaurants and bars fell in October for the first time in six months. Restaurant traffic declined further in November, according to the reservations provider OpenTable. Hotel occupancy is down from a month ago. Consumer spending on credit cards dropped in the first week of November from a month earlier, according to data compiled by Opportunity Insights.

US RETAIL SALES MISS EXPECTATIONS IN OCTOBER

After the deep recession that erupted in early spring, the economy did rebound faster over the summer and fall than most economists had expected. And some industries are still faring well. Home sales rose to a 14-year high last month. Manufacturing output, too, is still growing, though it remains below pre-pandemic levels.

But those positive signs reflect an unequal recovery. While lower-paid employees in face-to-face industries have lost jobs or fear losing them, higher-paid Americans have mainly been able to keep working from home. These consumers have shifted much of their spending away from services, like eating out, going to movies and hitting the gym, to buying goods — from computers and home and garden supplies to appliances and fitness equipment.

Yet many of those purchases have occurred online, with e-commerce sales having jumped 29% in the past year. By contrast, sales at physical retail stores, excluding autos, are essentially flat over the past 12 months.

As Story, the Atlanta consumer, and other Americans cut back and as colder weather ends outdoor dining in much of the country, consumer spending will likely weaken and hiring slow. Layoffs could rise. The number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose last week to 742,000 — a historically high number and the first increase since early October.

Small businesses are particularly worried about being forced to shut down again.

“If we close, it will be a devastation,” said Paulette Garafalo, CEO of Paul Stuart, a high-end clothing retailer that operates five stores in Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C.

The stores previously closed for four months while the company pivoted to online sales. But that shift generated only about 25% of pre-COVID business. Sales have since improved. But Garafalo doesn’t envision a boost from the holiday season. She just hopes sales won’t fall.

GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

Out of a sense of urgency, Garafalo's stores have called in their most seasoned sales people to alert customers to new merchandise and aggressively marketing a gift guide.

Likewise, Elonka Perez, who co-owns two restaurants in Washington state, says she’s “scared out of my mind” after Gov. Jay Inslee banned indoor dining again. Perez doesn’t know if her Taco Street restaurant in Seattle will earn enough money from takeout to survive colder weather.

“Winter is typically the slowest time for restaurants,” Perez says.

Taco Street was open for indoor dining for only a few weeks before having to shut down again. Perez and her husband have been pouring their savings into the business. They don't know how long that can continue.

Macy’s, long an iconic symbol of the holiday shopping season, had to temporarily close its store in El Paso, Texas, because of a viral surge there. The chain is studying how the surge in viral cases is affecting the willingness of shoppers to enter its stores. In the meantime, Macy's has sped up its checkout service for curbside delivery.

Other chains, particularly Target and Walmart, have benefited from changing habits. Customers are increasingly spending more when they visit the two chains, because they can combine shopping trips and buy food, clothes and other household goods — all at one location. That additional spending has come at the expense of small and independent stores.

For many consumers, the pandemic has transformed what shopping means. Alyse November, a licensed social worker in Boca Raton, Florida, says her clients have become increasingly stressed about shopping.

“Shopping was an outlet to relieve stress — it was an escape from life,” November said. “Now, it’s a source of stress because the process of it is so cumbersome. ... We don’t know how to do it and do it safely.”"

Jul 28 2022,US economy enters technical recession after growth tumbles 0.9% in the second quarter,Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-economy-shrank-second-quarter-entering-technical-recession,"The U.S. economy shrank in the spring for the second consecutive quarter, meeting the criteria for a so-called technical recession, as raging inflation and higher interest rates forced consumers and businesses to pull back on spending.

Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the economy, shrank by 0.9% on an annualized basis in the three-month period from April through June, the Commerce Department said in its first reading of the data on Thursday. Refinitiv economists expected the report to show the economy had expanded by 0.5%.

Economic output already fell over the first three months of the year, with GDP tumbling 1.6%, the worst performance since the spring of 2020, when the economy was still deep in the throes of the COVID-induced recession.

""Policymakers will no doubt be tying themselves in knots trying to explain why the U.S. economy is not in recession,"" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors. ""However, they make a strong point. While two consecutive quarters of negative growth is technically a recession, other timelier economic data are not consistent with recession.""

FED RAISES INTEREST RATES BY 75 BASIS POINTS IN ANOTHER HISTORIC MOVE TO TACKLE INFLATION

Recessions are technically defined by two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth and are characterized by high unemployment, low or negative GDP growth, falling income and slowing retail sales, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which tracks downturns.

With back-to-back declines in growth, the economy meets the technical criteria for a recession, which requires a ""significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."" Still, the NBER — the semi-official arbiter — may not confirm it immediately as it typically waits up to a year to call it.

FED'S POWELL SAYS HE DOES NOT THINK US ECONOMY IS CURRENTLY IN A RECESSION

The NBER has also stressed that it relies on more data than GDP in determining whether there is a recession, such as unemployment and consumer spending, which remained strong in the first six months of the year. It also takes into consideration the depth of any decline in economic activity.

""Thus, real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred,"" the nonprofit said on its website.

The committee does not meet regularly, only when members decide it is warranted.

The latest downturn stems from a number of factors, including declines in private inventories, residential and nonresidential investment, and government spending at the federal, state and local levels. Those decreases were offset by increases in net exports – the difference between what the U.S. exports and what it imports – as well as consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of GDP.

The report showed that consumers are spending far less than they were in the winter, with personal consumption expenditures climbing by just 1% for the period as high inflation persisted and eroded Americans' purchasing power.

The report will fuel a growing political crisis for President Biden, who has seen his approval rating collapse in conjunction with a faltering economy, and could complicate the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory as it weighs how quickly to raise interest rates in order to tame inflation without crushing economic growth.

Central bank policymakers raised the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points in June and July for the first time since 1994. They signaled that another increase of that magnitude is possible in September, depending on forthcoming economic data.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters that he does not believe the U.S. economy is in a recession.

""I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession, and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,"" Powell said. ""This is a very strong labor market. … It doesn’t make sense that the economy would be in a recession with this kind of thing happening."""

The American economy is set for its best year since 2005. Large corporations are producing giant profits. Even wages are starting to rise.

And the stock markets are a mess.

On Tuesday, the S&P 500-stock index turned negative for the year, stoking fears that one of the longest bull markets in history could be at risk.

The stock market’s struggles may seem incongruous against the backdrop of strong economic growth. But stocks often act as an early warning system, picking up subtle changes before they appear in the economic data.

In recent weeks, retail stocks have been hit over concerns of rising costs, a sign that President Trump’s global trade battles may be starting to take a toll and that higher wages are cutting into profits. Commodities and the companies that depend on them have been pummeled by the prospect of weaker demand should the global economy slow. Five tech giants — Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Netflix — have shed more than $800 billion in market value since the end of August, the fallout from slowing growth and regulatory scrutiny."
Nov 07 2020,"The Economy, Racial Inequality, and COVID-19 Topped Voter Minds",Reason,right,https://reason.com/2020/11/06/the-economy-racial-inequality-and-covid-19-topped-voter-minds/,"Despite years of verbal fireworks, charges of foreign election interference, and political warfare culminating in an impeachment trial, it's quite likely that the inconclusive outcome of the 2020 election comes down to the events of the last eight months. Pundits and political junkies may fret over Russia, immigration policy, personal temperament, and the like, but average voters say they care most about racial inequality, the economy, and the pandemic. But—after rivers of vitriol and billions of dollars spent to sway votes—it seems Americans are most concerned about what they've experienced since March of this year.

First, a caveat: pollsters across the country are currently curled in the fetal position, nuzzling booze bottles as they contemplate the failings of their industry in predicting election outcomes. But exit polls ask people about what they've done rather than what they plan to do. And if we take the precise numbers with a grain of salt, we can at least get a read for what is on American minds.

When asked by Edison Research exit pollsters which one policy was the most important in deciding their vote for president, the three top picks were the economy (picked by 35 percent), racial inequality (picked by 20 percent), and the coronavirus pandemic (picked by 17 percent).

Of those naming the economy as their top concern, 82 percent say they voted for Donald Trump and 17 percent say they voted for Joe Biden. Of those naming racial inequality, 91 percent voted for Biden and 8 percent for Trump. Pandemic voters broke 82 percent for Biden and 14 percent for Trump. That is, Americans are as divided as everybody thinks, just not in exactly the way political junkies are.

These three issues featured prominently in people's lives and in headlines since early this year and are thoroughly intertwined. The U.S. entered 2020 with a strong economy that had seen continuous growth for over 10 years. That trend came to a grinding halt with the spread of COVID-19 around the world, people isolating themselves, and governments imposing business closures and lockdowns that brought much of normal life to a halt.

""A peak in monthly economic activity occurred in the U.S. economy in February 2020,"" the National Bureau of Economic Research announced in June. ""The peak marks the end of the expansion that began in June 2009 and the beginning of a recession. The expansion lasted 128 months, the longest in the history of U.S. business cycles dating back to 1854.""

The shifting economy ""was affected by special circumstances associated with the pandemic of early 2020,"" the NBER acknowledged.

The stresses of the pandemic and of unemployment and economic uncertainty added to preexisting tensions—many of them having to do with conflict between minority communities and the police.

""The pandemic has put the U.S. into a recession, and it's likely to worsen,"" wrote Brian Michael Jenkins of the RAND Corporation in August. ""Millions are unemployed; soon, many of them could be destitute. COVID-19 and the economic distress it's causing could change how people behave in a (seemingly) more hostile world, how they view the legitimacy of government authority and how they value life itself.""

""Adding to the radicalizing ferment of this pandemic are the widespread anguish and anger over systemic racism and police brutality unleashed by the killing of George Floyd,"" Jenkins added.

In response to Floyd's shooting and similar incidents, Americans across the country took to the streets against police brutality in protests that sometimes turned into riots. It was an issue of deep importance to many people.

This is the world in which those who voted on November 3 lived in the months before Election Day. For many, it's been a fraught experience of health risks, economic collapse and recovery, and uncorked outrage over historic wrongs. It makes sense that these issues would be prominent in people's minds as they decided how to cast their votes—generally along much-discussed tribal lines, but not motivated by the ongoing concerns emphasized by the chattering class.

That puts into interesting perspective the essentially never-ending campaign that the major political parties and their leaders waged from 2016 until the present day, with the rehashing of the first presidential contest blending into preparations for the second without relief. The degree to which the events of 2020 matter to voters also casts doubt on all the time, energy, and money put into allegations of corruption, sexual hijinks, and foreign meddling.

Speaking of money, an estimated $8 billion went into political advertising this election cycle, with Democrats outspending Republicans by $2 billion, according to Advertising Analytics. That's a lot of cash and TV and radio time purchased by politicians who often seem to be focused on issues that matter to them and aren't necessarily of the greatest importance to the people they're trying to reach.

Media types—yeah, I'm part of that—haven't done much better in getting a handle on what drives people to vote. They hammer at the idea that Trump voters must be motivated by racism and then goggle as his support increases among blacks and Latinos.

""When Donald Trump pulled off a stunning upset and won the presidency in 2016, few people were more shocked than the professional take-havers in the mainstream media,"" Reason's Robby Soave pointed out the day after the election. ""Four years later—in the midst of a nail-bitingly close election—the predictions of the pundit class have proven to be no more accurate than they were in 2016.""

As it turns out, it appears that most people largely ignored years of huffing, puffing, and internecine political warfare that entertain those of use with an unhealthy obsession with politics. They saved their attention for the approach of the election itself and the state of the world in which they live. Americans didn't all come to the same conclusions by any means; it's still a deeply divided country, after all. But, by all appearances, it's the world of the present, not the controversies of the past, that motivated voters."
Nov 21 2020,The West’s Constitutional Crises Threaten the Economy’s Last Best Hope,Foreign Policy,center,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/11/21/fed-ecb-constitutional-crisis-is-coming-for-big-finance-too/,"In the looking-glass moment of November 2020 we should perhaps no longer be surprised to see the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, demanding more fiscal action to address the coronavirus crisis. But one does have to pinch oneself. Did we ever dream that we would see the central bank guardians of price stability taking on the role of lead cheerleaders for massive fiscal activism?

In the looking-glass moment of November 2020 we should perhaps no longer be surprised to see the chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, and the head of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, demanding more fiscal action to address the coronavirus crisis. But one does have to pinch oneself. Did we ever dream that we would see the central bank guardians of price stability taking on the role of lead cheerleaders for massive fiscal activism?

Earlier in the year they hardly needed to make the case. Fiscal activism was the order of the day. Central banks were crucial in stabilizing the financial markets in March and April. But the main burden of the coronavirus response lay with fiscal policy. The pandemic has triggered a crisis of the real economy first and foremost, not a collapse of credit. The U.S. CARES Act was a prompt and massive stimulus measure. At first the European Union flailed. But then in July the Europeans agreed a quasi-constitutional settlement, with a common program of borrowing to fund the joint Recovery Pact. This would provide the fiscal backdrop to enable Europe to achieve not just a recovery, but the first steps toward its much-vaunted Green Deal. With fiscal policy taking the lead, central banks could play a supporting role, juicing financial markets with quantitative easing.

What has now driven the central bankers into action is that since the summer, on both sides of the Atlantic, the political agreement on the terms of fiscal policy has broken down. And that puts the central banks in an exposed position.

In the absence of government spending or tax cuts, the burden of sustaining the economy is inevitably left with the central bank. Under normal circumstances, politicians are happy to hand off their problems to central bankers working quietly on the margins of political life. But the partisan conflicts and disagreements that have emerged this year on both sides of the Atlantic are so deep that a more dramatic possibility has emerged: that the central banks themselves are sucked into the political fray.

2019 gave a foretaste. At the time, the world faced a mini recession brought on in part by U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war. The Fed faced vicious attacks from Trump for failing to respond with lower interest rates. Powell found himself compared by Trump to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. In Europe, the recessionary storm clouds were even darker. Berlin was standing pat on fiscal austerity. To meet the threatened deflation, then-ECB President Mario Draghi was prompted to launch a final round of quantitative easing. This was welcomed by the markets, but it unleashed a storm of protest from within conservative European central banking circles. The anti-Draghi revolt was figure-headed by Jens Weidmann of the Bundesbank.

One year on, as Europe and the United States confront the second phase of the coronavirus crisis, American politicians wrangle over the still-disputed presidential election, and Europe faces its nationalist-populist demons, we are witnessing a new cycle of politicization.

In the United States, the stimulus consensus broke down over the summer, ahead of the election. The Democrats were hoping that an electoral blue wave would give them control of Congress and the political platform for a $2 trillion stimulus. That hope came crashing down on the night of Nov. 3. Assuming the Republican Party retains control of the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will have a deciding say in any legislation from President-elect Joe Biden and the House Democrats.

That painful prospect triggered open discussions in the Biden camp about the possible use of the remaining funds in the Fed’s emergency programs as a way of sidestepping the Republican roadblock in Congress. But the Trump administration and its allies in Congress saw that coming. On Nov. 19, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ordered the Fed to wind up programs to support lending to America’s small and medium-sized businesses, and backstop the municipal funding market. He did so over protest from the Fed and the Chamber of Commerce, an unusual alliance for a Republican treasury secretary to find himself facing. Unusual too was the remark made by the Chamber of Commerce that Mnuchin’s action would “prematurely and unnecessarily tie the hands of the incoming administration.”

Effectively, America’s most prominent business lobby is condemning the refusal of a Republican-led Treasury to honor the basic cooperation on which the functioning of the U.S. Constitution depends. Aggressively acting to curb the Fed’s ability to lend doesn’t just limit its ability to offset the lack of fiscal stimulus over the coming months. It will also make it far more difficult for the Biden administration to relaunch stimulus in the new year.

There has been much talk of the Trump administration taking a scorched-earth approach to China, escalating tensions to the point at which the Biden administration is deprived of options. It is alarming to see that same logic extended to economic policy. If in foreign policy, the tactic of the outgoing Trump team is to set more fires than the Biden administration can cope with. In economic policy, Mnuchin’s decisions amount to removing the fire extinguishers. Neither is consistent with the turn-taking required by democratic turnovers. We are fortunate that the vaccine news is good, otherwise one might expect a more violent market reaction, which the Treasury, Fed, and Congress would find difficult to quell.

If U.S. economic policy is being sucked into the Republicans’ stop-at-nothing effort to hobble the Biden administration, in Europe the question of the rule of law is front and center in Lagarde’s dilemma. The July fiscal package was feted in Europe as a breakout of the impasse that had threatened crisis in the EU. It was immediately applauded by the markets, which sent the euro higher against the dollar.

But it required ratification from the European Parliament and national governments. Any large-scale spending package raises the question of who will receive what. The European Parliament is deeply preoccupied with the increasingly aggressive deviations of Poland’s and Hungary’s governments from rule-of-law norms. As part of the July recovery package, Poland and Hungary are set to receive grants and loans from the EU that in both cases exceed 10 percent of GDP. The European Parliament decided to make this conditional on rule-of-law conditions—on recipient governments proving their commitment to democracy and transparency. But those terms are unacceptable to Poland and Hungary, which have also found an ally in Slovenia. Together they have vetoed the EU budget and the recovery funds, which also includes the EU’s proposed funding push for its green energy transition.

As in the United States, in the absence of political commitment and will, the current stability of European markets depends on the confidence that the ECB will step in where necessary. Its willingness to buy bonds blocks any return to the nightmares of the eurozone crisis seems to promise a more unified and forward-looking Europe. Unlike in the United States, the ECB does not have a partisan Treasury to deal with. But as 2019 revealed, the European system itself is marked by deep tensions among the central bankers, notably between a more conservative faction led by the Germans and the current ECB leadership and its allies in Southern Europe. Though the ECB has since March engaged in substantial bond buying to stabilize sovereign debt markets, taking the risk out of Italian and Greek bonds, it is clear that this has faced criticism internally, most likely from the Bundesbank side.

Where this conflict has exploded into the open is so far not over the purchases of sovereign debt but over green policy. Despite the EU’s commitment to investment policy, Weidmann of Germany has come out openly against any ECB involvement in green finance. He confines his comments to technical issues. But in the conservative German press, led by the formidable Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the stakes are higher. Green interventions are not just a matter of fossil fuel financing—they are seen as an effort by the current French leadership of the ECB to widen the remit of the central bank and redefine its source of legitimacy no longer around price stability but around a broader range of societal objectives. These include environmental sustainability but also, of course, the stability of the euro and the bond-buying programs that secure it. Green finance thus becomes a proxy battlefield for the main issue, which is whether the central bank’s mandate should be expanded beyond the task of maintaining price stability. Not now but some years down the line that will mean a battle over bond market support and the current elevated spending levels by national governments.

Of course, the parallels between American and European developments only go so far. Whereas the United States is a unitary state dominated by a single partisan cleavage, the political economy of Europe is split along two axes: East-West and North-South. Though that is more complex, it also means that the internal divisions within the European monetary system are not aligned with the conflicts with Poland and Hungary, neither of which is part of the euro. It will likely be possible to defuse the situation by stitching up a compromise with Warsaw and Budapest. This may come at the expense of the rule of law, but it would relieve the ECB. In the United States, even when the Democrats take control of the Treasury, the fundamental partisan division will remain, running across every area of policy and shifting the arena from the Treasury-Fed axis to the Senate.

Nevertheless, for all the differences in structure and divergences in their politics, in mid-November 2020 both of the big Western blocs have at least this much in common. They do not have in place a coherent fiscal policy response to the second wave of the crisis. In both cases, basic questions of a constitutional variety are being posed. And the firewall between politics and monetary policy has once more been breached."

Jun 29 2012,GOP shifts health-care debate to the economy,Washington Post,left,http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-refocuses-health-care-fight-on-obamas-economic-stewardship/2012/06/29/gJQAM31TCW_story.html,"The battle over President Obama’s health-care law, settled as a legal matter by the Supreme Court, reopened in the political arena Friday, as Republicans sought to rebound by refocusing the debate on Obama’s stewardship of the economy. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Stung by the court’s decision to uphold the law, the GOP zeroed in on the portion of the ruling that justified the constitutionality of the individual mandate by casting it as a tax, within Congress’s authority. Republicans argue that the measure represents a massive tax hike on the middle class that will stunt job growth.

“The court has declared that President Obama can have the federal government use its powers of taxation to compel behavior, and that’s one of the most frightening legal aspects of this decision,” Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a conference call with reporters that was arranged by the Republican National Committee. “It really raises the question, what’s next? Taxes on people that refuse to eat tofu or refuse to drive a Chevy Volt?”

The attacks drew a sharp response from the White House. In a memo to Capitol Hill Democrats, titled “Winning the Middle Class Tax Battle,” Obama’s senior adviser, David Plouffe, insisted that the health-care law will lower costs for millions of families. He cited projections estimating that less than 1 percent of the population would forgo health insurance and may be subject to federal penalties.

""Republicans in Washington are trying to deliberately misrepresent the President's record of cutting taxes for the middle class,"" Plouffe wrote. ""We welcome this debate . . . and we urge you to seize this opportunity to go on offense.""

The back-and-forth suggested that health care will continue to resonate into the fall, with both sides rallying their troops with extensive fundraising appeals and new television advertisements.

Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign reported that it raised more than $4 million in the 24 hours after the ruling, which has mobilized grass-roots conservative activists who had been cool on Romney in the GOP primary. And American Crossroads, a conservative super PAC, announced that it will launch a national ad campaign on cable television hitting Obama on the health-care ruling.

“Now it’s official: Obama increased taxes on struggling families. The middle class takes another hit,” the ad says.

The Republican Party is betting that November 2012 will be a redux of November 2010, when backlash against the health-care law helped sweep a wave of tea party Republicans into the House, delivering the speakership to Rep. John A. Boehner (Ohio).

“I think the Supreme Court’s ruling may have awakened a sleeping giant,” said Ron Christie, a Republican strategist. “Obama may have won the battle in the Supreme Court, but the war is yet to be waged for November.”

Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said that the president’s reelection team also enjoyed a surge in fundraising after the health-care ruling, though he declined to be specific. In an fundraising e-mail on Friday, senior campaign adviser David Axelrod recalled his daughter Lauren’s near-fatal battle with epilepsy that began 30 years ago and, he said, nearly bankrupted his family because of their “lousy” health insurance.

“I was moved to tears when the Supreme Court affirmed the Affordable Care Act, because I know that other families won’t have to face the terror and heartache we knew,” Axelrod said. The seizures continued for 18 years, he said.

The debate also resonated on the state level, with Jindal and several other Republican governors announcing that they would not move to implement parts of the law until after the election, in hopes that Obama would lose and the act could be repealed.

“We’re going to do everything we can here in this swing state to help elect a new Senate and help elect a new president in four months,” Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said during the RNC conference call.

But swing-state Democrats said they would not shy away from engaging the GOP and did not fear losing votes among independents who might be cool to Obama’s legislation.

“It’s going to be a great issue anytime you have such a clear contrast,” said Chris Redfern, Democratic Party chairman of Ohio, where Obama will launch a two-day bus tour next week. “Our side is standing up for breast cancer survivors and young people who have lost a job and do not have health care.”

Democrats also said they would continue to remind voters that Romney, while governor of Massachusetts, authored a health-care law that was the template for Obama’s legislation and included a penalty for those who choose not to purchase health care.

That will make it difficult for Romney to embrace the Republican attack line that the law represents a tax hike, Democrats said. On the campaign trail, Romney has called the legislation a “job-killer,” hoping to wrap health care into his overall message on the economy."
Jul 07 2012,Obama Urges Voters to Look Ahead on Economy,New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/us/politics/obama-urges-voters-to-look-ahead-on-economy.html,"PITTSBURGH — For President Obama, evangelist of hope and change, it’s not easy to confront an election season with so little of either.

On Friday, after the release of the third straight anemic employment report, Mr. Obama found himself on a campaign bus tour, conceding that the economy was not generating enough jobs, that the recovery was not taking hold quickly enough, and that too many Americans lacked basic financial security.

“It’s still tough out there,” Mr. Obama said to a sympathetic crowd in an elementary school gymnasium in Poland, Ohio. Later, in Pittsburgh, he said, “Too many of our friends and family members and neighbors are still out of work; too many folks still are seeing their home property values underwater.”

With few signs that the labor market will strengthen much before Election Day, Mr. Obama is honing a vocabulary to talk about the listless economy — one that emphasizes a glass-is-half-full approach to the numbers and an appeal to voters to take the long view when assessing the nation’s economic fortunes."

Jun 08 2012,GOP slams ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rosy remarks on economy,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/8/gop-slams-obamas-rosy-remarks-economy/,"President Obama’s comments Friday that the “private sector’s doing fine” attracted sharp and immediate counterfire from GOP nominee Mitt Romney and fellow Republicans, who said the remarks showed the president was badly out of touch on the plight of the economy.

In his remarks to reporters at the White House Friday morning, Mr. Obama tried to draw a distinction between private sector job growth and continuing cutbacks by cash-strapped state and local governments, saying it was public-sector job losses and the refusal by Republicans to back his job-creation plans that were holding the larger U.S. economy back.

“The truth of the matter is, we’ve created 4.3 million jobs over the last 27 months — over 800,000 just this year alone,” Mr. Obama said. “The private sector’s doing fine. Where we’re seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do with the state and local governments.”

He suggested GOP lawmakers are resisting his job-creation proposals because they’re motivated by election-year concerns.

“If Republicans want to be helpful, if they really want to move forward and put people back to work, what they should be thinking about is how do we help state and local governments and how do we help the construction industry,” Mr. Obama said.

Within less than an hour, Mr. Romney and top Republicans on Capitol Hill were firing back.

Campaigning in Iowa, Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama’s comment was “an extraordinary miscalculation and misunderstanding.”

“I think he’s defining what it means to be detached and out of touch with the American people,” Mr. Romney said at an event in Council Bluffs, Iowa, pointing to the 23 million Americans who are unemployed or under-employed.

“For the president of the United States to stand up and say the private sector is doing fine is going to go down in history,” he added.

House GOP leaders also laughed off the president’s assertion that private industry is improving, citing in part a disappointing jobs report for May and national unemployment still above 8 percent.

“My question would be to the president: ‘Are you kidding?’” said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Virginia Republican. “Did you see the job numbers that came out last week? The private sector is not doing fine.”

Later in the day, Mr. Obama tried to clarify his comment.

“It’s absolutely clear the economy is not doing fine,” Mr. Obama said while sitting next to Philippines President Benigno Aquino in the Oval Office. “That’s the reason I had a press conference. That’s why I spent yesterday, the day before yesterday, this past week, this past month and this past year talking about how we can make the economy stronger. The economy is not doing fine. There are too many people out of work. The housing market is still weak, too many homes underwater and that’s precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that can make a difference. And the question then is what are we going to do about it?”

The president said “what I’m interested in hearing from Congress and Mr. Romney is what steps are they willing to take right now that are going to make an actual difference. And so far what we’ve heard are additional tax cuts that the folks who are doing fine as opposed to taking steps that would actually help deal with the weaknesses in the economy and promote the economic growth that we’d all like to see.”

House Republicans also pushed back at Mr. Obama’s criticism of lawmakers for not acting on his jobs initiative, saying it was Mr. Obama’s “failed stimulus policies” that had dragged the economy down.

“Frankly I’d ask the president to stop engaging in the blame game,” said Mr. Cantor, who vowed that House Republicans will spend the summer “directly focused on how we can make the environment better for small-business men and women to grow and create jobs in this country.”

House Speaker John A. Boehner, Ohio Republican, said next month he will hold a vote to extend current tax rates, a move he says would help create a better environment for job creation.

“With these looming tax hikes and the regulations coming out of Washington, we have frozen employers in place,” he said.

Mr. Obama opened the press conference, which the White House announced about 90 minutes before it began, with a plea for Congress to approve parts of his $447 billion jobs package that lawmakers have already rejected. He said the “unemployment rate would be lower, and our economy would be stronger” today if Congress had adopted his proposals last fall.

“They left most of the jobs plan just sitting there,” Mr. Obama said. “I urge them to reconsider.”

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said the president is fooling only himself with his assessment that the private sector is “doing fine.” He said Mr. Obama should work with the GOP on extending George W. Bush-era tax cuts for all Americans that are due to expire Dec. 31.

“Whether the president wants to acknowledge it or not, we are now living in the Obama Economy, and no ‘Post-It Note’ proposal can reverse the damage done by his policies over the past 3½ years,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement. “It’s baffling that in the face of all evidence to the contrary, this president still believes that spending money we don’t have to inflate the government is the answer to America’s economic problems. The Obama Economy is even slower now than when we extended the rates in 2010 — raising taxes on job creators in this slow economy is simply not the elixir for his failed policies.”

Aug 20 2020,Rise in jobless claims reflects still-struggling US economy,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/bcab5f132b190c5c2b61a750cce33343,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The coronavirus recession struck swiftly and violently. Now, with the U.S. economy still in the grip of the outbreak five months later, the recovery looks fitful and uneven — and painfully slow.

The latest evidence came Thursday, when the government reported that the number of workers applying for unemployment climbed back over 1 million last week after two weeks of declines.

The figures suggest that employers are still slashing jobs even as some businesses reopen and some sectors like housing and manufacturing have rebounded.

“Getting the virus in check dictates when there’ll be relief from this economic nightmare, and it doesn’t look like it will be soon,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at Indeed, a job listings website.

The scourge in the U.S. has killed more than 170,000 people and caused over 5.5 million confirmed infections, with deaths rising by more than 1,000 a day on average. Worldwide, the death toll stands at about 790,000, with over 22 million cases.

The overall number of laid-off American workers collecting unemployment benefits declined last week from 15.5 million to 14.8 million. Many of them probably found jobs. But some may have used up all their benefits, which in most states run out after about six months.

In Europe, meanwhile, fears mounted over rising infections, many of them attributed to vacationers and young people lowering their guard.

Italy added nearly 850 cases to its count, with Sardinia becoming a hot spot because of people partying at nightclubs and other spots without masks. Greece reported 269 new infections, matching a record high set two days earlier. Amid a surge in Spain, emergency coordinator Fernando Simón said younger people should take into account the risk of infecting older relatives.

“Nobody should be fooled. Things are not going well,” he said.

In France, President Emmanuel Macron insisted the country will send millions of students back to school starting Sept. 1, despite the biggest weekly spike in cases since the height of the outbreak in March and April — over 18,000.

“The return to school will happen” in the coming days, Macron said. “We will not bring our countries to a halt, but we will have to learn to live with the virus.”

Elsewhere around the world, India logged a record 69,652 confirmed infections in a single day.

In the U.S., the previous weekly report from the Labor Department showed new jobless claims had dipped below 1 million for the first time since March, to 971,000. But that trend reversed itself this time.

Many businesses and consumers remain paralyzed by uncertainty and restricted by lockdowns, and job gains appear to be slowing from the rapid bounce-backs of May and June, when millions of restaurant and store employees were rehired. The number of job openings posted on Indeed fell last week for the first time since April.

Twenty-two million jobs were lost to the outbreak in March and April. In the past three months, only 9.3 million have been regained, and unemployment remains high at 10.2%.

Until the virus can be brought under control, economists agree, any recovery is destined to remain weak.

Kronos, a company that makes time-tracking software for small businesses, said the number of shifts worked by its clients is barely growing after rising steadily in the previous three months. Shifts worked are stuck at about 10% below their pre-pandemic level.

“It’s increasingly clear that the last 10% of the recovery will be the most challenging,” said Dave Gilbertson, a vice president at Kronos.

At the same time, those who are drawing unemployment are now getting far less aid because a $600-a-week federal benefit has expired, which means they must get by solely on the much smaller benefits from their states. That has deepened the struggle for many and put some in danger of eviction.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to provide $300 a week in federal unemployment aid. Twenty-eight states so far have said they will dispense it, though they would need to revamp their computer systems, and it could take a few weeks for the money to start flowing to some recipients. Arizona said Monday it has started paying out the extra $300 this week, the first state to do so.

While home construction and sales have bounced back along with auto purchases, small businesses are struggling, and spending on travel, entertainment and many other services is still weak. While more Americans are eating at restaurants, seated dining is still 54% below pre-pandemic levels, according to OpenTable.

Daniel Zhao, an economist at Glassdoor, an employment website, said the industries with the largest increase in job openings are health care and e-commerce and delivery services. But those gains reflect mainly responses to the outbreak rather than economic growth.

Thursday’s report showed that in addition to people who applied last week for state benefits, roughly 540,000 others sought aid under a new program that has made self-employed and gig workers eligible for the first time. That figure isn’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so it is reported separately.

Including the self-employed and gig workers brings to 28 million the number of people receiving some form of jobless aid, though that figure may include double-counting in some states. That number is little changed from a week earlier.

State unemployment benefits average about $308 a week. Louisiana pays the nation’s lowest average, $183, Hawaii the highest, $456.

For John Williams, a former cabdriver in Slidell, Louisiana, just outside New Orleans, the loss of the $600 in federal benefits landed him in a food bank line this week, waiting for groceries. He now receives just $107 in state unemployment aid, which is all that he qualifies for based on his previous income.

Before the virus dried up most of his business, Williams, 77, used to pick up fares at the New Orleans airport. Now, besides his jobless aid, he receives about $300 a month from Social Security and a small pension from a previous job as a maintenance man in the city’s school system. He can barely cover his mortgage.

Williams has gone two days without taking his blood pressure medication because when he went to have it refilled, the cost had doubled.

“I’m hanging in there, doing the best I can,” he said.

At Tuesday’s press briefing, Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Olivia Dalton introduced National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to reporters saying, “Lael has been a tremendous asset to our team as we’ve navigated the past few months. And today, she’s here to talk with you about Bidenomics, which is the word of the day, word of the week, word of the month, word of the year here at the White House. And Bidenomics is rooted in the belief that we grow the economy when we grow the middle class.”

Wednesday morning the White House released a statement claiming, “Bidenomics Is Working: The President’s Plan Grows the Economy from the Middle Out and Bottom Up—Not the Top Down” (excerpt):

President Biden and Vice President Harris came into office determined to rebuild our economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down—and that strategy is working. Even as they faced an immediate economic and public health crisis—with a raging pandemic, elevated unemployment, snarled supply chains, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses at risk of shuttering—the President and Vice President understood that it wouldn’t be enough to simply go back to the economy we had before the pandemic. That economy was saddled with longstanding challenges that held America back—including rising inequality and disinvestment from communities across the country. President Biden recognized that some of those challenges were rooted in a failed trickle-down theory that supported slashing taxes for the wealthy and big corporations, shrinking public investment in critical priorities like infrastructure and education, and failing to safeguard market competition. The President took office determined to move beyond these failed trickle-down policies and fundamentally change the economic direction of our country. His plan—Bidenomics—is rooted in the recognition that the best way to grow the economy is from the middle out and the bottom up. It’s an economic vision centered around three key pillars: Making smart public investments in America

Empowering and educating workers to grow the middle class

Promoting competition to lower costs and help entrepreneurs and small businesses thrive

(Bold in original.) While our work isn’t finished, Bidenomics is already delivering for the American people. Our economy has added more than 13 million jobs—including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs—and we’ve unleashed a manufacturing and clean energy boom. There were more than 10 million applications for new small businesses filed in 2021 and 2022—the strongest two years on record. America has seen the strongest growth since the pandemic of any leading economy in the world. Inflation has fallen for 11 straight months and has come down by more than half. And we have done it all while responsibly reducing the deficit.

What does “Bidenomics” mean for the average American? Biden exposing “hidden fees” in high dollar Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen and pro sports tickets.

Nonfarm payrolls increased by 943,000 workers in July as the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%, the Labor Department said Friday. Analysts surveyed by Refintiv were expecting 870,000 jobs gained and the unemployment rate to fall to 5.7% from 5.9%. June’s reading was revised higher by 88,000 jobs to 938,000.

""Although there have been some cracks in the armor, today’s jobs number showed that once again our economy is incredibly resilient and moving forward,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.

Notable job gains were seen in leisure and hospitality (+380,000), which saw two-thirds of the jobs gained in food services and drinking places. Public and private education (+261,000), professional and business services (+60,000), transportation and warehousing (+50,000) also saw sizable gains. Construction and wholesale trade were little changed.

The jobs gains occurred as three additional states ended the supplemental $300 per week in unemployment benefits. A fourth state, Maryland, was scheduled to end the benefits but was blocked from doing so by a Baltimore judge.

The labor force participation rate was little changed at 61.7%. The rate has held between 61.4% and 61.7% since June 2020.

Average hourly earnings rose 0.4% month over month and 4% annually. Economists had expected respective increases of 0.3% and 3.8%.

As the economy continues to recover from its COVID-19-induced slowdown, economists have begun to question the need for the emergency measures put in place during the early days of the pandemic. The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and has been buying U.S. Treasurys and other assets at a pace of $120 billion per month.

The central bank said at its most recent meeting that it would need to see ""substantial further progress"" before beginning the tapering process.

Recent comments from Federal Reserve Board members Richard Clarida and Christoper Waller indicated a run of strong jobs reports would be evidence of such progress.

Fed tapering is ""squarely on the table for 2022,"" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth."
Aug 05 2020,"Tribe, economy, even cemeteries hurt as virus hits Choctaws",Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/c8345dcd874a3136b59a4b619bdd3761,"PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) — When Sharon Taylor died of coronavirus, her family — standing apart, wearing masks — sang her favorite hymns at her graveside, next to a tiny headstone for her stillborn daughter, buried 26 years ago. Fresh flowers marked row after row of new graves. Holy Rosary is one of the only cemeteries in this Choctaw Indian family’s community, and it’s running out of space — a sign of the virus’s massive toll on the Choctaw people.

As confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocket in Mississippi, the state’s only federally recognized American Indian tribe has been devastated. COVID-19 has ripped through Choctaw families, many of whom live together in multigenerational homes. Almost 10% of the tribe’s roughly 11,000 members have tested positive for the virus. More than 75 have died. The once-flourishing Choctaw economy is stagnant, as the tribal government put in place tighter restrictions than those imposed by the state.

July brought a glimmer of hope, with some numbers dropping among Choctaws, but health officials worry that with cases rising elsewhere in the state, the reprieve is only temporary. On Friday, Mississippi recorded its highest single-day coronavirus-related fatality count, 52.

As a community health technician, Taylor, 53, took the virus seriously from the start. She answered calls from tribe members with symptoms and delivered medicine. In June, she fell ill herself.

Kristina Taylor, 18, one of Sharon’s five children, learned just before her mother was admitted to the hospital that she’d been named valedictorian of the tribal high school. Sharon had predicted the accomplishment for years — in some of their last moments together, Kristina showed her mom the speech she’d prepared for graduation and the Choctaw beadwork her sister used to decorate her cap.

“We were just in tears. Usually, if I started crying, she started crying too,” she said. “She always had that faith in me, that I could do it, even when I doubted myself. She knew I could do it before I did.”

That day, Sharon Taylor took her daughter to the family plot at Holy Rosary. It was always special: a place to mark important events, to be together, to visit the grave of baby Kerri. Other relatives are buried there, too, and it’s where Sharon wanted her final resting place.

But the Rev. Bob Goodyear says there’s not much more room to expand, in part because of another pandemic. The Spanish flu of 1918 took lives so quickly residents didn’t even have time to put up markers, and 400 victims are buried in an open field on cemetery grounds.

“I pray it doesn’t come to that this time,” said Goodyear, whose Catholic church has always buried Choctaws, regardless of faith. The tribe recently voted to establish a community cemetery nearby, which will ease the burden, said Goodyear, who isn’t a Choctaw but has ministered in the reservation community for decades.

Dr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said that like other Native American communities, coronavirus deaths among the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians have been driven by underlying conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure, present in more than 80% of deadly Mississippi cases. The reservation hospital, where Taylor worked, can’t handle severe coronavirus cases. They’re sent to facilities elsewhere in the state - Taylor died 80 miles (129 kilometers) from home, in Jackson.

In Neshoba County, named for the Choctaw word for wolf, more than 25% of residents live under the poverty line. It’s a rural area, characterized by dusty red clay and rolling pine-filled hills. The Golden Moon Casino on Highway 16, with a glittering moon on its roof, serves as a welcome to Choctaw land. From there, the reservation spreads out over 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares).

Choctaw Indians used to live across millions of acres in southeastern Mississippi but were forced off the land. Under an 1830 treaty, the Choctaws were to move to Oklahoma. Those who remained in Mississippi endured segregation, racism and poverty.

In the 1990s, the Choctaws started building what became a strong tribal economy. They own a family-style resort with a water park and two casinos; the tribe is a leading employer in eastern Mississippi.

But the tribal government has been more conservative in reopening efforts during the pandemic than Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and other Mississippi officials. The tribe passed a mask requirement July 1, but Reeves refused to implement one statewide, until Tuesday. Choctaw casinos remain closed, more than two months after the state allowed casinos to reopen. About 2,000 employees are furloughed, the tribal chief said. The annual Choctaw Indian Fair, which draws thousands, was canceled.

The tribe has long been a target of hate, members say, and the virus has only made things worse. On social media, people blame Choctaws for high case numbers. Choctaw employees have been harassed at their jobs; others are called names in stores.

“We’ve heard so many bad things about ourselves and our people — the first thing people turn to is blame and hate,” said Marsha Berry, a tribe member who helped form a group that delivers food and other necessities to people self-isolating.

Anita Johnson lives near the funeral home that has handled arrangements for all the Choctaws lost to the virus. Each time a funeral procession passes her house, her family stops what they’re doing to pray.

“It seemed like in Choctaw families, that’s all that was in front of us: You’re going to get sick, you’re going to get the fever, you’re going to end up going to the hospital, and you’re going to die,” she said.

When Sharon Taylor died, her family couldn’t grieve as Choctaws normally would. Because of the chief’s ban, there was no bonfire for the occasion, no wake with people dropping by for days to pay respects and drop off meals.

Instead, at her graveside, her family shared stories of the woman who valued their tight-knit family and community above all else, who never missed a gathering and always had a grandchild on her lap. They sang the hymns she loved, the ones she’d sung to her kids, and then her grandkids.

Her 25-year-old daughter, Kristi, is pregnant, and she’d like to name her baby girl for Sharon.

“She was always looking out for other people,” Kristina Taylor said. “Now, she’s watching over us.”

Jul 13 2022,White House seeks to keep focus on the economy with summit as Biden heads to Middle East,CNN (Online News),left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/12/politics/economy-focus-white-house/index.html,"CNN —

Vice President Kamala Harris will welcome a group of state and local officials to the White House on Wednesday as the administration seeks to draw attention to key elements of President Joe Biden’s cornerstone legislative achievement.

Harris will headline a half-day White House Summit on the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion economic package Biden signed into law in the depths of the dual-pronged economic and public health crisis in 2021.

The summit will detail a series of specific state and local efforts and more than $40 billion in funding for workforce development across industries. At its core, it’s viewed by administration officials as a way to highlight successful models for other officials around the country to utilize as they seek to spend remaining funds from the law.

“What we really wanted to do was to be able to give people a sense that the American rescue plan is helping people not just get back to work, but get back to better jobs at better pay and, so doing, meet many of the jobs most in demand in both the private and public sector,” a senior administration official told CNN in a preview of the summit, which will also highlight plans to disburse more than $3 billion additional, competitively awarded ARP funds in the months ahead.

The summit comes as Biden is set to face a critical foreign policy test with his first trip to the Middle East, which includes stops in Israel, the West Bank and Saudi Arabia. But the event underscores a recognition inside the White House that the domestic economy remains the administration’s top and most pressing priority.

It’s with that in mind, and with growing pressure from the Democratic Party to highlight successful elements of Biden’s first 18 months in office, that the summit will seek to draw attention to elements of the largest economic rescue plan in US history.

Harris is expected to use her remarks to underscore what officials view as the groundwork laid by funding from the law to create more careers – and more sustainable ones – in essential professions across health care, home care and education because of training, apprenticeship and certification programs, the official said.

Officials are particularly focused on the health care sector, where some states and localities deployed the funds to create pathways for workers who may have joined to address specific pandemic needs, like assisting in tracing or vaccination programs, but now have training opportunities to build longer-term careers in the field.

In its entirety, it’s a law that officials view as under-appreciated at a moment of soaring inflation as the lingering effects and persistence of the pandemic, as well as other factors, have led views of the US economy to sour dramatically in recent months.

“In a world of screaming headlines and global inflation around 9% and a war in Ukraine, they may not compete for national headlines, but I think people are already feeling meaningful impacts in their cities and states and communities and that in time people will see,” the senior administration official said.

Republicans, who were unified in their opposition to the rescue package, have pilloried the proposal for helping to drive inflation to its highest level in more than 40 years. It’s an issue they’ve also leveraged to try and sink Biden’s legislative agenda.

“This all-Democrat government has already spent America into runaway inflation, and now they want to tax us into recession,” Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday on the Senate floor.

While White House officials acknowledge the potential demand-side effects of elements of the law, they cite widespread Covid-related supply chain issues and the Russian invasion of Ukraine as the primary drivers of the broad-based price increases.

More broadly, they note the focus on inflation misses the broader effects of a proposal that helped drive a far more rapid recovery than economists forecasted in the midst of the pandemic-driven economic collapse.

That, as much as providing models or road maps for other local officials, is the genesis of the summit.

Two Democratic governors – Roy Cooper of North Carolina and Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania – will participate in the summit. Cooper will highlight a series of state-based initiatives to increase pay and retention for childcare and home care workers, as well as broad workforce development initiatives.

Wolf is set to detail his state’s care and health care workforce efforts.

The White House is set to detail more than $13 billion in state and local funding that has been committed to funding workforce programs, more than $16 billion to bolster and train home care and health care workers and more than $12 billion utilized to train and expand the teaching workforce.

Panels featuring mayors, county supervisors and commissioners, community and labor leaders will highlight specific programs that have been implemented due to the law.

The White House will also set to detail more than three dozen specific proposals they view as providing road maps and best practices for states and localities still holding allocated funds – and the acute threat of economic calamity shifting to questions of how to lay the groundwork for a more sustainable workforce.

“We know you have had to stabilize and prevent closures,” the official said in detailing the message the White House hopes to send to local officials. “But what could you do or what models could you follow on actually creating career paths, giving people credentials, increasing pay on the types of credentials that keep people doing this valuable work?”

Sep 11 2020,Is the economy running fast or slow? It depends where you look.,Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/Business/2020/0911/Is-the-economy-running-fast-or-slow-It-depends-where-you-look,"For those focused on the ongoing deep downturn in certain sectors, the Democrats’ much larger relief package might appear more appropriate. Could the economy recover without any stimulus? That’s a risky premise, according to economists. Says Daniel Zhao at job site Glassdoor: “We don’t want to see the recovery lag when we’re still so deep in the hole.”

So when Congress tries to craft a relief package, it has to consider which picture to look at. For those focused on signs of recovery, a Republican Senate proposal that failed to advance Thursday might have looked just fine: extra unemployment benefits at $300 per week, half the level of the previous round of relief, and added funding for a small-business loan program.

The U.S. economy really has made a lot of progress since the pandemic caused a spring nosedive. But it's also far from recovered, leaving a sharp divide between booming and struggling sectors.

In places like Montpelier, Vermont, companies like TimberHomes Vermont are booming, with demand surging for everything from its trailhead kiosks to timber-framed cabins. But down the road, businesses that aren’t so geared for this era of social distancing are struggling, including a massage parlor and an art-house cinema that shows independent films.

One reason Congress is struggling with passing a new coronavirus relief bill is that economic recovery is operating at two speeds: forward and a sputtering neutral.

Business is booming at TimberHomes Vermont outside Montpelier. Demand for its timber-framed structures – from trailhead kiosks to rustic cabins – is high. In the past two weeks, the company has hired three new workers and is in the process of adding another two to keep up with the surge in demand, boosting the workforce by a quarter.

“We’re definitely firing on all pistons,” says Timo Bradley, one of six member-owners of the company.

But heading into Montpelier, less than a mile down the road, Massage Vermont is temporarily closed while its co-owners try to operate virtual healing sessions using breathing techniques. And in the state capital itself, the Savoy Theater, an art-house cinema showing independent films, is now open only for weekends. On its home page is a link to a national campaign. The message reads: “Tell Congress to #SaveYourCinema.”

Why We Wrote This The U.S. economy really has made a lot of progress since the pandemic caused a spring nosedive. But it's also far from recovered, leaving a sharp divide between booming and struggling sectors.

Will Congress hear? And if so, which company will it listen to?

In Vermont and across the United States, economic recovery is taking place at two speeds. Some companies are moving, even rocketing, ahead. Others seem stuck in neutral, waiting for pandemic rules to ease or demand to pick back up. And for Congress, faltering in its bid to pass a new coronavirus relief bill, the proper size and scope of the package may hinge on these mixed signals as well as on an ideological divide over economic policies.

If one looks for signs of recovery, there’s plenty of evidence for it. E-commerce, home-related industries, and goods-producing companies are seeing demand snap back smartly after a dismal spring.

“For the moment, it looks like households have been able to sustain spending pretty well,” despite the expiration of $600-per-week extra federal benefits to the unemployed, says Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Research in New York.

Thus, the economy might benefit from a small stimulus bill, such as the GOP’s so-called “skinny” rescue package, which failed to advance in the Senate on Thursday.

For those focused on struggling businesses, the House Democrats’ $3 trillion package looks far more appealing. It would provide checks to individuals and offer a cushion of federal aid to companies and state and local governments, buying them more time to recover from the effects of lockdowns and squeezed revenues.

“We don’t want to see the recovery lag when we’re still so deep in the hole,” says Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, an online job and recruiting site. “It just extends the length of the recovery” toward pre-pandemic employment levels. “And the longer the recovery, the greater the risk that temporary reductions turn into permanent losses.”

Michael Conroy/AP View caption Hide caption A help wanted sign is displayed at a Home Depot store in Indianapolis on Sept. 2, 2020. The U.S. unemployment rate has fallen since the spring, but remains severely elevated at 8.4%. Republicans and Democrats in Congress remain far apart on how much additional economic aid the government should provide.

The big question for Congress now is whether the pace of recovery is sustainable without further federal help. And here the evidence is mixed. Not only has consumer demand held up, but corporate earnings have snapped back since the spring, sometimes with surprising speed.

Whether due to those relatively positive signals or clashing partisan positions, it appears to have grown more difficult for members of Congress to reach a compromise – despite the economy’s parallel signs of severe stress.

“Unfortunately, what has happened is that they’ve taken their foot off the gas because momentum has waned for the urgency of the moment,” says Caroline Bruckner, an American University tax expert who researches women-owned businesses. But “that’s not what I see in my neighborhood. It’s not what I hear when I talk to ... business owners.”

Within a short walk from her home, she counts at least seven restaurants that have closed permanently since the spring.

“In every crisis, you’re going to have a population that thrives, right?” Professor Bruckner adds. “But that’s not everybody. And, you know, the data is pretty clear that self-employed workers – who are the smallest of small business owners – are suffering pretty intensely.”

One potential reason that consumer spending looks OK is that the previous round of federal stimulus checks built up a reserve of savings that consumers can now draw on, says Mr. Millar of Barclays Research. A study for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that through early July the recipients of those payments had spent only about 40% of the money. The rest either went to pay off debt or was stashed away in savings accounts.

“It’s not too surprising that it’s 40%,” says Michael Weber, a finance professor at the University of Chicago business school and a co-author of the study. Stimulus checks in previous downturns generated only a slightly higher rate of spending.

The danger is that that saved stimulus will run out and that demand will taper off, economists warn.

If the goal is to stimulate demand, there are more efficient ways to do it, Dr. Weber adds. His study found that low-income families, people out of the labor force, and larger households with children were more apt to spend their stimulus payments than other groups.

The GOP proposal didn’t include new stimulus checks, and instead would have restarted the extra federal payments to the unemployed at $300 per week. For businesses, the bill offered includes liability protection for COVID-19 and a new round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which offered loans to small businesses and forgave the debt if firms held on to their employees. The House bill included general stimulus checks, extra unemployment benefits at the previous $600 per week rate, an extension of the PPP, and more.

Other stimulus targets might also provide more bang for the buck, the NBER study suggests, such as direct government purchases of goods and services and aid to cash-strapped local and state governments to help prevent them from cutting the services they provide. The latter provision was a feature of the Democratic measure, not the Republican one.

All this suggests that, should the recovery falter or Wall Street plunge to new depths, pressure on Congress to do something will ratchet up and the prospects of a bipartisan compromise would brighten.

But speed is important, analysts say. “Better to have something small now than waiting another four or six weeks,” says Dr. Weber.

Dec 02 2022,"US economy adds 263,000 jobs in November, better than expected as hiring remains solid",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/us-economy-adds-jobs-november-better-expected-hiring-remains-solid,"U.S. job growth rose faster than expected in November, as the labor market remained resilient in the face of higher interest rates, scorching-hot inflation and mounting recession fears.

Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, topping the 200,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. It marks a slight deceleration from the upwardly revised job gain of 284,000 recorded in October. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.7%.

The report will likely do little to sway the Federal Reserve in its fight against inflation, which has already seen policymakers raise interest rates at the most aggressive pace since the 1980s in a bid to crush out-of-control consumer prices and cool the labor market.

In another concerning sign that could further complicate the Fed's job, average hourly earnings surged 0.6% in November, double what Refintiv analysts anticipated. Wages are 5.1% on an annual basis, far higher than the 4.6% estimate.

THE FED'S WAR ON INFLATION COULD COST 1M JOBS

""The November jobs report provides another dose of reality for the markets which have gotten ahead of themselves on another ‘Fed pivot’ narrative,"" said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth. ""While the headline payrolls number was strong, the wage data is going to be eye-popping for the Fed.""

Stocks tumbled on Friday morning as investors weighed the stronger-than-expected report. Dow futures tumbled more than 400 points, while S&P 500 futures shed about 1.7%.

LAYOFFS MOUNT AS JOB MARKET GETS MURKY

Job gains were broad-based in November, with leisure and hospitality leading the way in hiring, adding 88,000 new workers. That was followed by health care (45,000), government (42,000) and social assistance (23,000).

However, some sectors saw payrolls shrink last month: Department stores shed 21,800 workers, and transportation and warehousing cut positions by 15,100.

While monthly jobs data is always important, the Fed is closely watching this particular report for signs the labor market is starting to slow down from its frenzied pace as policymakers try to wrestle inflation, which is still running near a 40-year high, back to 2%.

""We don’t expect today’s jobs report to change the Fed’s near-term path,"" said David Donabedian, the chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth. ""However, this inflation-unfriendly report likely changes how high the Fed will take rates, maybe raising rates higher than investors are prepared for and lifting expectations slightly for the peak Fed Funds rate in 2023.""

Fed officials have already approved six straight increases, including four back-to-back 75-basis-point hikes, raising the federal funds rate to a range of 3.75% to 4%. They are widely expected to approve a 50-basis-point rate hike when they next meet on Dec. 13-14, moving interest rates further into restrictive territory.

DEMOCRATS SLAM 'DANGEROUS' FED RATE HIKES, WARNING OF WIDESPREAD JOB LOSSES

Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending.

There have already been some notable layoffs this year: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Lyft and Twitter are among the companies either implementing hiring freezes or letting workers go. That could soon bleed into the broader labor market; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made it clear that policymakers anticipate job growth will slow and unemployment could climb as they raise interest rates higher, but he has argued that an alternative where prices soar unchecked is worse.

""Right now, people's wages are being eaten up by inflation,"" Powell said Wednesday. ""If you want to have [a] sustainable, strong labor market, where real wages are going up right across the wage spectrum, especially for people at the lower end, you've got to have price stability."""

Jun 25 2020,Jobless claims and depressed economy show damage from virus,Associated Press,left,https://apnews.com/fa8499715b15252f959aed371b10b3a3,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of laid-off workers seeking U.S. unemployment aid barely fell last week, and the reopening of small businesses has leveled off — evidence that the job market’s gains may have stalled just as a surge in coronavirus cases is endangering an economic recovery.

The government also reported Thursday that the economy contracted at a 5% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a further sign of the damage being inflicted by the viral pandemic. The economy is expected to shrink at a roughly 30% rate in the current quarter. That would be the worst quarterly contraction, by far, since record-keeping began in 1948. Economists do expect a snap-back in the second half of the year, though not enough to reverse all the damage.

Last week, the number of people applying for jobless benefits declined slightly to 1.48 million. It was the 12th straight weekly drop. An additional 700,000 people applied through a program for self-employed and gig workers that made them eligible for aid for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the official count.

Combining those figures, overall applications for jobless aid have edged down just 3% in the past two weeks — a much slower pace than in late April and May.

“There has been no real decline in weekly claims the past two weeks,” said Julia Pollak, a labor economist at ZipRecruiter. “There has also been no real increase in job openings. What seemed like encouraging signs of recovery in May largely stalled in June.”

A separate government report Thursday said orders for durable goods unexpectedly jumped nearly 16% in May, reflecting a rebound in some business activity. Still, the pace of orders and shipments remains far below pre-pandemic levels. And excluding the volatile transportation category, so-called core orders rose only modestly, reflecting still-sluggish business investment.

The virus is once again squeezing companies across the economy.

Disney is postponing the scheduled mid-July reopening of its Southern California theme parks until it receives guidelines from the state. Macy’s is cutting nearly 4,000 corporate jobs — roughly 3% of its workforce — in response to financial strain caused by the virus.

Apple announced late Wednesday that it would re-close seven of its stores in the Houston area, which is suffering a spike in cases. Last week, it had said would re-close 11 other stores in four states. And the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese restaurants will seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, in part because of the restaurants it has been forced to close as a result of the pandemic.

Larry Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, asserted Thursday on Fox Business that the economy is rebounding quickly.

“I think the strong ‘V’ recovery is right still there,” Kudlow said, referring to the shape of a sharp rebound on a chart.

Most private economists, though, foresee a much more tepid recovery. And the latest economic figures coincide with a sudden resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States, especially in the South and West, that is threatening to derail the nascent economic rebound. On Wednesday, the nation set a high for new confirmed coronavirus cases. Many states are establishing their own new peaks for confirmed daily infections, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada, Texas and Oklahoma. Cases of coronavirus have also jumped in Florida and Georgia.

The number of infections is thought to be far higher still because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest that people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.

Should the trends continue, states may reimpose some limits on businesses that would likely trigger job cuts. And if not, consumers may choose to shop, eat out, and travel less.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Thursday that that state will suspend its business reopenings amid a surge in coronavirus infections.

Real time data on small businesses suggests that the job market’s improvement slowed in June compared with May, when 2.5 million jobs were unexpectedly added. About 78% of small businesses have reopened as states have lifted shutdown orders, according to data from Homebase, a company that provides scheduling and time-tracking software to small businesses. Yet nationally, that figure has been flat for the past week.

In states that are suffering spikes in COVID-19 cases, small businesses are closing again and cutting some jobs.

Ray Sandza, an executive at Homebase, said the plateau in business reopenings is a worrisome sign that the remaining 20% of small companies could end up closing permanently.

“If you haven’t reopened yet, the likelihood of coming back is low,” Sandza said.

He noted that most small businesses had just one or two months’ of cash on hand when the pandemic intensified three months ago.

In Florida, Texas, and Arizona, the proportion of small businesses that have closed has risen in the past week as a result of the resurgent viral outbreaks. And in Arizona, as of Monday, the number of employees working at small companies was 31% below the pre-pandemic level. That’s worse than the previous week, when it was 26.5%.

Homebase’s data showed a solid rebound in jobs and hours worked in May that was consistent with the May jobs report, which also showed that the unemployment rate fell to 13.3% from 14.7%. Those are the two highest unemployment rates since the Great Depression.

Other real-time data is showing similar results. Kronos, which also produces small business scheduling software, said the number of shifts worked is now growing at only half the pace it was in late April and May. And shifts worked have actually fallen in 10 states in the past week, according to Dave Gilbertson, a Kronos official.

Thursday’s data on jobless claims included one bright spot: The total number of people receiving unemployment benefits aid fell to 19.5 million from 20.3 million, which suggests that employers are rehiring some workers.

For the unemployed, the federal government has been providing $600 in weekly benefits, on top of whatever state jobless aid recipients are receiving. This federal money has pumped nearly $20 billion a week into the economy and enabled many of the unemployed to stay afloat.

It has been a major help to Alexis O’Neill, who was laid off in March from an accounting job at an aviation fuel company. O’Neill, 49, who lives with her mother in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is looking for a job that would allow her to work from home so she could avoid putting her mother at risk of contracting the virus.

She has applied for at least a dozen jobs but has received no responses except an acknowledgement of her application. Many open jobs now seem to offer lower pay than before the pandemic struck. Compounding the dilemma for O’Neill, Michigan is stuck with the nation’s second-highest state unemployment rate, 21.2%.

“The job market is terrible,” she said. “Everything either pays so badly or doesn’t come with benefits.”"
Feb 04 2022,"Economy crushed expectations with 467,000 jobs in January despite omicron surge",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/economy/economy-beats-expectations-with-467-000-jobs-in-january-despite-omicron-surge,"The economy crushed expectations in January and added 467,000 jobs, a surprising and encouraging sign that the labor market pulled through the omicron surge relatively unscathed.

The job gains for the past two months were also revised up by 710,000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, meaning that what had previously seemed like lackluster growth throughout the early winter was in fact robust.



The growth is particularly welcome news considering that it occurred despite the headwinds presented by the omicron variant, which suppressed commerce and kept millions of workers sick at home and technically unemployed.

“This was certainly not the downside surprise in payrolls that many were braced for. Quite the contrary,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “Between the pick-up in wages, an improvement in labor force participation, and a much better-than-expected jump in employment, including upward revisions in previous months, this is a strong report. This is good news for workers and a sign that the economy is powering through the omicron wave.”

Friday’s report showed an increase in the labor force participation rate, which generated an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4%.

Economists feared that surging cases of the omicron variant of COVID-19 would put a major damper on January’s report, given that people out sick without pay are counted among the unemployed, even though they still have jobs. The White House warned earlier this week that the report could be disappointing for that reason.

RECORD NUMBER OF SMALL BUSINESSES BOOSTED WAGES LAST MONTH AMID LABOR SCARCITY

Friday’s report found that 3.6 million were out of work because of illness, about double what the norm was throughout the pandemic.

Cases of the new variant peaked in mid-January after spiking over the holidays. While the strain is more contagious than previous iterations of the virus, it is also believed to be less deadly. Still, the large volume of people calling in sick resulted in supply chain disruptions and in companies implementing renewed coronavirus-prevention policies, such as remote work.

New cases are down 49% from two weeks ago, and hospitalizations are down 16%, although deaths are up 35%.

Even with the surge, jobless claims, which are a more forward-looking indicator, have been less than expected — more positive news for the country’s recovery.

While the unemployment rate is below 4% and inching downward toward its pre-pandemic low of 3.5%, the economy is still millions of jobs short of where it was prior to the start of the pandemic.

Still, inflation has soared in recent months. In December, inflation was 5.8%, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, far above the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal. The central bank has moved quickly in recent weeks to try to tighten monetary policy to curb inflation.

The Fed has held its interest rate target near zero during the pandemic to try to encourage spending. Investors now expect that the Fed will hike rates five or six times this year."
Jul 02 2021,"Economy beats expectations with 850,000 jobs in June, unemployment at 5.9%",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/economy-beats-expectations-850000-jobs-june-unemployment-5-9-percent,"The economy rebounded and added 850,000 new jobs in June, a welcome result after two months of disappointing growth.

The unemployment rate slightly increased to 5.9%, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.

The numbers exceeded expectations, with the consensus among economists being that 700,000 jobs would be added, and unemployment would drop from 5.8% to 5.7%.

Employment in the leisure and hospitality industry grew 343,000, another strong showing, as pandemic-related restrictions continued to ease across the country. More than half of those job gains were in restaurants and bars as vaccination rates increase.

NEW JOBLESS CLAIMS AT 364,000, LESS THAN PREDICTED

At least 67% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 58% are fully vaccinated. That number is much higher among vulnerable populations, with 88% of those 65 or older having a least one shot and 78% fully inoculated.

President Joe Biden called the jobs report “historic progress” and said the United States is emerging from the “worst crisis in 100 years.” Biden said the economic recovery was a “direct result of the American Rescue Plan.”

Speaking about the lack of bipartisan support for the $1.9 trillion spending package, the president said: “Well, it worked.”

Despite the progress being made in the labor market, the country is still 6.8 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic high.

Nick Bunker, who leads North American economic research at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said that “things are picking up” after the report was published on Friday.

“All that employer demand is turning into jobs and higher wages for many workers. While labor supply may not be as responsive as some employers might like, they are adding jobs at an increasing rate. This pace of progress is solid and it looks like things can get even better,” he said in a statement provided to the Washington Examiner.

“There’s still quite a bit of damage left to repair, but today’s report suggests that we may rebuild sooner rather than later,” he added.

The June jobs report was hotly anticipated, with Republicans characterizing it as a make-or-break moment for Biden’s economic agenda.

Friday’s report is good news for the Biden administration, which has faced criticism for an apparent labor market shortage. Some employers are having trouble finding workers, which GOP states are blaming on supercharged federal unemployment benefits.

Twenty-five states, all Republican-led, have announced that they would opt-out of the federal unemployment benefits boost before it sunsets in September. Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah are among some of the states that have already ended unemployment benefits. South Carolina did so on Wednesday, Maryland and Tennessee will do so on July 3, Arizona on July 10, and Indiana is set to do so on July 19.

Friday’s jobs report follows a Thursday report from the Labor Department that found jobless claims were less than anticipated. Some 364,000 people filed for unemployment, beating economists’ predictions of 390,000 doing so."
Jun 13 2022,Fact check: Biden falsely claims US has 'fastest-growing economy in the world',CNN Fact Check,left,https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/politics/fact-check-biden-fastest-growing-economy-jimmy-kimmel/index.html,"Washington CNN —

In a Wednesday appearance on the ABC late-night show “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” President Joe Biden made a dramatic claim about the US economy – and repeated himself for emphasis.

“Look, here’s where we are. We have the fastest-growing economy in the world. The world. The world,” Biden said.

Facts First: Biden’s claim is false. The US economy grew by 5.7% in 2021, but more than 50 other countries had faster growth that year, figures published by the International Monetary Fund show; many of them are small or developing countries, but some of them are large or wealthy. In addition, the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2022, while various other countries experienced growth. And while economic experts expect the US economy to resume growing over the rest of this year, a significant number of other countries are expected to grow faster.

Asked for comment on Friday, a White House official did not attempt to specifically defend Biden’s claim that the US has the fastest-growing economy in the world.

Instead, the official pointed out that the 5.7% growth in the United States’ real gross domestic product in 2021 was the fastest for the country since 1984. The official also pointed out that the International Monetary Fund has projected that, as of the fourth quarter of this year, the size of the US economy will be bigger relative to its late-2019 pre-pandemic level than any of the other six countries in the international forum known as the Group of Seven: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

Those comments are accurate. But Biden said on Kimmel’s show, three times, that the US economy is growing faster than that of any other country in “the world,” not just growing faster than six particular countries. And that’s inaccurate.

“Clearly the US has been the G-7 economy that has done best in terms of GDP growth rates since the inception of COVID, but is not literally the fastest-growing economy in the world over this period,” said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti, a former International Monetary Fund official who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank’s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy.

How the US compares

Biden took office in late January 2021. Among the dozens of countries that saw faster real GDP growth than the US in 2021 were Ireland (13.5%), Chile (11.7%), Turkey (11%), Colombia (10.6%), India (8.7% for the fiscal year that began in April 2021), Greece (8.3%), Israel (8.2%), China (8.1%), the United Kingdom (7.4%), France (7%) and Italy (6.6%), according to figures published by the IMF and the countries’ governments. (Many countries’ growth rates were higher than usual in 2021 because their economies were rebounding from the 2020 economic crisis caused by the pandemic.)

An economic outlook released this week by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projected the US would grow by 2.5% in 2022. That was lower than the OECD’s 2022 projections for 11 other members of the Group of 20 international forum: Saudi Arabia (7.8%), India (6.9% for the fiscal year), Indonesia (4.7%), China (4.4%), Australia (4.2%), Spain (4.1%), Canada (3.8%), Turkey (3.7%), the United Kingdom (3.6%), Argentina (3.6%) and South Korea (2.7%).

We’ll add one caveat. There are various ways to measure growth – among other things, you can pick different start and end points and different gauges of economic activity – and there are various complications involved in the data.

Laura Veldkamp, a finance professor at Columbia University’s business school, said there is “no way” that Biden’s claim is true if he was using “fastest-growing” in the usual way, referring to a percentage change. She said, however, that she would personally describe the President’s claim as “misleading,” rather than false, since “the word growth in conversation can mean many things.”

We’ll respectfully stick with our harsher conclusion. If Biden was citing some unusual or obscure measure of growth, he could have explained that. He didn’t, and the White House didn’t either when asked for comment."

Now the question is whether the coming months can deliver an even fuller recovery — and how much of a shadow will be cast by the higher prices that have come with it."
May 13 2020,"Democrats ruining the economy by fighting to keep lockdowns, Republicans say",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/democrats-ruining-the-economy-by-fighting-to-keep-lockdowns-republicans-say,"Republicans say Democrats who are fighting to keep tight pandemic lockdowns are cratering the economy. The GOP strategy is to prevent President Trump from shouldering the blame if there is no turnaround before Election Day.

Concern has soared within the previously confident Republican establishment about Trump’s prospects against Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Fears are tracking unemployment, which has skyrocketed from 3.5% to 14.7% in just six weeks. It is likely to go higher this month. Democrats, trying to frame the debate in the run-up to voting, talk of a “Trump depression” and blame the free fall on the president’s mishandling of the pandemic.

Ironically, it is most commonly Democratic officials who oppose Trump’s efforts to reopen the economy and revive the jobs market. The Left is prioritizing preventing the spread of the coronavirus instead. Democrats are thus caught in a 180-degree contradiction, holding Trump responsible for a recession but refusing to open the economy.

Republicans say this opens Democrats to the wrath of voters who are increasingly worried about their finances.

“It’s a disconnect,” said Brad Todd, a veteran Republican strategist. “Democrats are arguing that the economy is bad and that we should keep it shut down. That’s not going to be lost on voters.”

A fresh poll of Wisconsin voters from Marquette University Law School suggests political trends could favor Republicans as the election draws near. In this closely divided Midwest battleground, critical to Trump’s reelection, only 49% of Republicans say business and schools should stay closed, down from 83% in March. Among independents, there is 69% support in Wisconsin, down from 79% last month.

[Read more: Trump seeks to reopen as early goal of keeping hospitals from overcrowding is achieved]

But other data shows voters more worried about health than economic recovery, which makes Democrats confident that making Trump responsible for the recession is a vote winner.

“I don’t think the American people think we’ve succeeded at containment,” said Democratic strategist Joe Trippi.

Democrats believe they can make the case that Trump bungled his response to the coronavirus, exacerbating damage to the economy, which he agreed needed to be shut down, and generating a death toll that stood at more than 82,000 Tuesday evening. They say there is no contradiction in pointing this out while warning that reopening the economy too soon would make both the recession and the pandemic worse.

“Trump owns that,” said Ed Espinoza, a Democratic operative in Austin, Texas.

The president still gets good marks on his handling of the economy. In the Wisconsin poll from Marquette University Law School, his job approval stood at 47%, above his national average, although he trailed Biden 46% to 43%. Some Republicans are confident that as voters shift their attention from coronavirus mitigation to jobs, the economy, and the question of who is the most qualified to lead a recovery, Trump’s past performance will carry him past Biden.

Privately, other Republican insiders doubt this assessment. Winning reelection during a historically bad economy is difficult for any president. Combined with Trump’s erratic messaging, voters may conclude he failed and vote for change, some GOP strategists fear.

“Biden’s best play may be admitting that nobody knows what’s to come, but you’re in better shape heading into the unknown with somebody who is stable,” a Republican consultant said. “It should be easy to make a case for change when you’ve got double-digit unemployment and 100,000 deaths.”"
May 06 2020,The economy is in free fall. So why isn’t the stock market?,Vox,left,https://www.vox.com/covid-19-coronavirus-economy-recession-stock-market/2020/5/6/21248069/stock-market-economy-federal-reserve-jerome-powell,"The stock market is doing fine, even though everything else is definitely not.

Earlier in the coronavirus crisis, Wall Street had a meltdown. Stocks plunged amid fears of the disease’s spread and its potential impact on the global economy, sometimes to the point that trading was halted altogether to rein in the chaos. But in recent weeks, the market has been doing okay. It’s not at the record highs it was in mid-February, but it’s not bad — the S&P 500 is hovering around where it was last fall. And given the state of the world — a deadly global pandemic with no end in sight, 30 million Americans recently out of jobs, an economy that’s fallen off of a cliff — a relatively rosy stock market is particularly perplexing.

Sure, the stock market isn’t the economy, but right now, it seems particularly divorced from what’s happening on the ground. “The gap between markets and economic data has never been larger,” wrote Matt King, global head of credit strategy at Citigroup, in a recent note.

It’s impossible to pinpoint what exactly is driving the market’s moves at any given moment — investors, after all, aren’t a monolith. But there are a handful of explanations that get at what’s happening now.

For one thing, the Federal Reserve and, to a perhaps lesser but still significant extent, Congress have taken extraordinary measures to pump money into the economy and prop up markets. The amount of spending they’ve done so far amounts to about one-third of GDP in a very short period of time, and that’s calming investors’ nerves. “The fundamentals don’t matter quite as much with that kind of liquidity deluge,” said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading.

Moreover, investors don’t really have a lot of places to go with their money — government bonds are offering super-low returns, if much at all. Among some on Wall Street, there’s a fear of missing out, and it appears retail investors have been playing the markets while in quarantine. Overall, it just seems the market may be feeling a bit more optimistic about the future than the science around coronavirus would suggest.

To be sure, there’s no guarantee this market rally will last, nor that investors have it right. And many traders, analysts, and experts admit everyone is operating in a black box. One West Coast-based equities trader told me it makes “zero sense.” A Goldman Sachs associate provided a variety of detailed explanations, but then offered a caveat, “If I’m being dead-ass honest, though, nobody knows what’s really going on.”

You can’t fight the Fed

Many people on Wall Street point to actions from the Fed as a main driver of the market’s rebound in recent weeks. Since late March, the central bank has announced a series of sweeping measures designed to help stabilize the economy, including plans to buy both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds. That translates to the Fed saying it will buy corporate debt that’s at low risk for default, and debt that is not.

The Fed’s maneuvers have injected an enormous amount of liquidity in the market and restored faith of both private corporate bond buyers and equity investors that the central bank is there to back them up. The Fed still hasn’t spent money on its corporate bonds program, but the promise that it could has been enough.

“This rally in equities is clearly not driven by fundamentals — it’s driven by the liquidity support from the Federal Reserve,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities, told the Financial Times. “Companies are getting cash to keep the lights on through the significant support to credit markets.”

In the modern bailout era, between the Fed and the federal government, there’s reason for equity investors to feel okay

This isn’t an entirely new phenomenon, explained Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. Something similar happened during the last crisis.

“I think of it as a great decoupling, and I’m not surprised that we’re seeing it, because this is very similar to what we saw during the global financial crisis, and it has to do, primarily, with monetary policy,” she told me. “What we saw during the global financial crisis is a Fed that provided extraordinary policy tools that it had never used before … and that was what decoupled the stock market’s fortunes from that of the economy. And so it came as no surprise that we saw the same thing happening this time.”

This can all feel a little wonky, but it boils down to: In the modern bailout era, between the Fed and the federal government, there’s reason for equity investors to feel okay.

A concrete example of the impact of the Fed’s maneuvers is Boeing. Last week, the aerospace company said it had raised $25 billion in a bond offering, and it didn’t need federal aid to do it because private investors had taken up the offer. Other companies have done the same, including Nike, Procter & Gamble, and Visa.

“If there’s that much appetite in the bond markets to invest in debt, as an equity investor, that’s a reason to feel okay about things in relative terms,” the Goldman associate, who asked to remain anonymous, told me.

Political will to do more on the stimulus end of things may be waning in the White House and among some Republicans, at least in the near term, but the Fed has indicated it plans to forge ahead. At a press conference last week, Fed chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is committed to using its “full range of tools” to support the economy as long as needed. “We have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy,” he said. “As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit.”

Gillian Tett, editorial board chair at the Financial Times, recently argued that what’s happening now with stocks is a test of whether you think this is a liquidity crisis or a solvency crisis — basically, whether you think corporate America’s woes are a short-term question or a long-term one. The Fed’s actions solve the immediate liquidity problem — they keep companies afloat right now — but they don’t solve whether a business is going to be viable and therefore able to pay back their debts in the long run. To go back to Boeing: That $25 billion bond raise is helpful right now, but the future of the company hinges on someone buying its planes.

“Many zombie companies will fail, no matter how much is sprayed around by the Fed,” Tett wrote.

The music’s still playing, so Wall Street’s still dancing

Ahead of the global financial crisis in 2007, then-Citigroup chief executive Chuck Prince made an observation: “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.”

While the context of his remarks was different — he was talking about private equity deals — in the current moment, the spirit of them still holds. The music’s still playing, and Wall Street’s still dancing.

Part of the issue is likely that there isn’t really a lucrative alternative to investing in stocks right now. As Paul Krugman at the New York Times recently noted, bonds offer super-low returns:

The interest rate on 10-year U.S. government bonds is only 0.6 percent, down from more than 3 percent in late 2018. If you want bonds that are protected against future inflation, their yield is minus half a percent. So buying stock in companies that are still profitable despite the Covid-19 recession looks pretty attractive.

The West Coast trader joked, “It’s tough for me to make a bull case on stocks right now that isn’t, ‘Welp, everyone else is buying and bonds are trash.’”

Which gets at another facet of this: fear of missing out. The market, broadly, is going up, everyone else still seems to be playing, and so people are staying in. And it’s not just big institutional investors, it’s individual retail investors, too. Bloomberg reports that E*Trade, Ameritrade, and Charles Schwab all saw record sign-ups in the first three months of the year, a lot of it amid coronavirus-induced volatility. One analyst speculated to Bloomberg that with casinos and sports betting closed down, some people were playing the markets instead.

Many companies are doing well, particularly in tech: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google-owner Alphabet, and Facebook reported strong earnings last week and make up about one-fifth of the S&P 500’s market value. And the stock market doesn’t reflect the economy in total; small businesses and companies that aren’t publicly traded are being hit hard right now, and that doesn’t show up in stocks.

“The market is probably priced somewhere between the most likely case and the best case, certainly on the most optimistic side of the most likely case”

The stock market is sometimes considered to be a leading indicator of what’s going to happen in the economy. And at the onset of the pandemic, it sounded the alarm before the economic data did, giving up 30 percent of its value in the course of a month. If you think it’s a leading indicator now, that means investors think things will be better in three to six months from now. Investors are pegging some of their hopes to a treatment for the coronavirus, and they’re excited about states reopening.

Jack Ablin, the chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors, told me the market is certainly looking at the sunnier side of the possibilities. “I will say the market is probably priced somewhere between the most likely case and the best case, certainly on the most optimistic side of the most likely case.”

Is the optimism warranted? Well, that’s the issue of the entire coronavirus crisis: No one has any idea what’s to come. “The coronavirus outbreak has rendered forecasting impossible,” wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a recent note.

“As a policy analyst, the motivation in the market right now is driven by the policy intervention and not the economic fundamentals, and so when investors are focused on contouring the policy intervention, it’s possible that they miss some of the broader fundamental trends, or at least neglect them,” Boltansky said.

Even if the stock market recovery holds, that might not translate to a comparable recovery for the economy. Hooper, from Invesco, pointed out that Main Street America had a “very anemic recovery for years” coming out of the global financial crisis compared to Wall Street. If there isn’t enough fiscal stimulus, namely from Congress, that could replay now.

Investors could be completely wrong

One theme of the coronavirus crisis is that anyone who tells you they know what’s about to happen next is lying, and that holds when it comes to the stock market. It moves on day-to-day news and headlines, which are constantly changing, and has been pretty volatile in recent months. There are plenty of voices out there warning that just because the market is up now doesn’t mean it will stay that way. The Wall Street Journal over the weekend delved into the ways investors are “flying blind,” where no one is exactly sure what’s going to happen with corporate earnings or the economy.

Bob Michele, chief investment officer at JPMorgan, told Bloomberg in a recent radio interview that the market’s current optimism reminds him of the early days of the financial crisis. “There’s a lot of hardship ahead,” he said. “This feels to me like the second quarter of 2008, where the first quarter was horrible, there were policy responses, and the market immediately became optimistic, and the horror of what actually happened starts to hit into the data.”

In the current moment, we have some data about how bad the economic crisis is. The economy shrank by 4.8 percent in the first quarter, and 30 million people have filed jobless claims. We’ll get a look at April unemployment numbers on Friday, and other data is still trickling in.

“Beware of the oddity in this bear rally,” Solomon Tadesse, head of North American quant equity research at Societe Generale, wrote in a recent note. “Given the overall negative undertone from the economic challenges ahead, the dramatic reversal of global markets after the pandemic lows is more puzzling.”

High-profile investor Jeffrey Gundlach recently said he is shorting the market, meaning he’s betting it will go back down. Former Goldman analyst Will Meade predicted this year is poised to look “exactly like” the dot-com bubble. Billionaire Warren Buffett, who in 2008 encouraged investors to “buy American,” at Berkshire Hathaway’s annual meeting over the weekend, struck a more somber tone. “You can bet on America, but you kind of have to be careful about how you bet,” he said.

“If we haven’t hit the bottom yet, things will get very, very bad, because then you’ll see a lot of cascading effects where a hedge fund will blow up, which means the pension fund that is invested in the hedge fund now has to take that loss, which means they have to de-risk, so they have to move out of equities,” the Goldman associate said. “There’s a very real possibility that people could get washed out, not just retail investors, but everybody.”

Jun 07 2022,World Bank warns global economy may suffer 1970s-style stagflation,Washington Post,left,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/07/world-bank-global-growth-forecast-stagflation/,"The global economy may be headed for years of weak growth and rising prices, a toxic combination that will test the stability of dozens of countries still struggling to rebound from the pandemic, the World Bank warned Tuesday. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight Not since the 1970s — when twin oil shocks sapped growth and lifted prices, giving rise to the malady known as “stagflation” — has the global economy faced such a challenge.

The bank slashed its annual global growth forecast to 2.9 percent from January’s 4.1 percent and said that “subdued growth will likely persist throughout the decade because of weak investment in most of the world.”

Fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has aggravated the global slowdown by driving up prices for a range of commodities, fueling inflation. Global growth this year will be roughly half of last year’s annualized rate and is expected to show little improvement in 2023 and 2024.

This will be the sharpest slump after an initial post-recession rebound that the global economy has suffered in more than 80 years, the bank said. And the situation could get even worse if the Ukraine war fractures global trade and financial networks or soaring food prices spark social unrest in importing countries.

“The risk from stagflation is considerable with potentially destabilizing consequences for low- and middle-income economies,” said David Malpass, president of the multilateral development institution in Washington. “ … There’s a severe risk of malnutrition and of deepening hunger and even of famine in some areas.”

If the worst outcomes materialize, global growth over the next two years could fall “close to zero,” he added.

With few exceptions, the economic outlook is troubled.

Now in year three of the pandemic, the global economy has been hit in 2022 by what the World Bank labels “overlapping crises” — fallout from the war in Ukraine, recurring coronavirus lockdowns affecting Chinese factories and the highest inflation rates in decades.

For now, the greatest areas of concern lie beyond U.S. borders. A recession in Europe is a real possibility, as the continent struggles to accommodate millions of Ukrainian refugees and deal with upheavals in energy markets. Elsewhere, the interruption of grain exports via the Black Sea is hurting countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and Somalia. China is suffering from its rigid zero-covid policies and battling costly property market weakness.

Though the U.S. economy shrank in the first three months of the year during the omicron variant surge, growth is expected to rebound in the current quarter, according to economists’ estimates. Financial market gauges of future inflation rates have declined since late April, easing — though not eliminating — fears of a prolonged price spiral.

Nathan Sheets, global chief economist for Citigroup, called the chance of a significant stagflation outbreak in the U.S. “remote,” in a recent client note.

Policymakers must act quickly to mitigate the Ukraine war’s consequences, help countries pay for food and fuel, and accelerate promised debt relief, while avoiding “distortionary policies” such as price controls and export bans, the bank said.

The World Bank’s Malpass said the global economy is being hampered by inadequate production capacity for key goods. “It’s very important to increase supply massively to really try to get at inflation directly by more production. Unfortunately, there aren’t signs of that very much yet,” he said.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has disrupted global energy markets, threatening Europe with recession and straining the budgets of countries that import large quantities of oil, natural gas, coal and fertilizer, the bank said.

As Europe weans itself from Russian energy products, its purchases from alternative suppliers compete with orders from existing customers, limiting available supplies.

Malpass said that to help offset surging prices, investments in additional energy production were desperately needed, especially to address a shortfall of natural gas supplies, which are used to produce electricity and fertilizer. Even announcements of future capacity could lower current prices, he said.

“Announcements of major production increases will be essential for restoring noninflationary growth,” he said.

The global stagflation threat could have particularly dire effects in the developing world, where per-person income this year remains nearly 5 percent below pre-pandemic levels, the bank said.

Persistent inflation raises the chances that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will sharply increase interest rates to cool off demand, as happened in the late 1970s. That could lead to a more punishing global slump and financial crises in some emerging markets, the bank said.

In the 1970s, Latin American countries, in particular, borrowed heavily from U.S. banks, taking advantage of low inflation-adjusted interest rates. But when central banks in the United States and Europe turned to fighting inflation and hiked borrowing costs, 16 Latin American countries stopped making their debt payments, according to the Federal Reserve.

Major banks cut off financing as they sought to negotiate new payment plans, plunging the region into a “lost decade” of anemic growth.

Today, developing countries as a group owe a record amount to foreign banks and other financial institutions. One-quarter of the typical poor country’s debt burden now carries variable interest rates, up from 11 percent in 2010. So as inflation-fighting central banks tighten credit, repayment costs will rise for cash-strapped borrowing nations, the bank said.

Sri Lanka last month defaulted on its foreign debts for the first time, and Malpass said he expects other highly indebted countries will do the same.

But the world’s top economies will not escape damage. Bank economists now expect the United States to grow this year by just 2.5 percent, down from the 3.7 percent rate they projected in January.

China, the world’s second-largest economy, will fall short of the government’s annual growth target, expanding by 4.3 percent. That would be Beijing’s worst full-year figure since 1990, excluding 2020 when the pandemic depressed activity.

Investors also could take a beating from a repeat of ‘70s-style stagflation. The S&P 500 stock index, already down more than 13 percent this year, could lose an additional 20 percent or more, according to a recent client note from Bank of America.

Led by the United States, the world roared out of the pandemic downturn with its fastest growth since 1973, a 5.7 percent gain. The global economy was expected to struggle this year as it adjusted to the loss of pandemic-era government spending and ultralow interest rates. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and continued coronavirus flare-ups — have made the situation tougher.

The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil has jumped to nearly $120, up about 50 percent this year. And wheat has staged a similar rally, leading the bank to call for urgent action to ease “worldwide food shortages.”

The World Bank’s downbeat forecast adds to concerns about global weakness. Most major stock markets, including those in the United States, are in the red so far this year. And the bank’s sister institution, the International Monetary Fund, lowered its global forecast in April.

With the U.S. and most other major economies suffering the highest inflation in 40 years, many economists in recent months have cited the danger of a 1970s rerun.

After enjoying robust growth for most of the previous decade, the global economy toppled into a prolonged slump in the 1970s. By 1982, global growth hovered near zero even as worldwide inflation surged into double digits, according to the World Bank.

Still, today’s global economy differs from the 1970s in important ways, the bank said. The run-up in commodity prices, though painful, pales alongside what happened almost five decades ago. Oil prices quadrupled in 1973-1974 before doubling again in 1979-1980 amid the overthrow of the shah of Iran."
Jan 27 2022,"Jobless claims drop to 260,000, suggesting economy is dodging worst of omicron",Washington Examiner,right,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/jobless-claims-drop-to-260-000-suggesting-economy-is-dodging-worst-of-omicron,"The number of new applications for unemployment benefits fell 30,000 last week to 260,000, in line with expectations and a sign that the omicron variant’s damage to the labor market is limited.

The jobless claims numbers reported on Thursday morning by the Labor Department suggest that layoffs have risen in recent weeks as the omicron variant spread through the country.

Claims rose higher earlier in January but now appeared headed back down to the very low levels seen in the fall, suggesting that employers are still desperate to hold on to labor.

“The first decline so far this year in seasonally adjusted new jobless claims is a welcome sign after three consecutive gains. Job security has been bolstered by significant improvement in the unemployment rate and solid rise in payrolls over the past year,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.

Omicron has moved quickly through the country and world and has resulted in event cancellations and more remote work for businesses.

CONFIDENCE IN BIDEN ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT IS IN SHARP DECLINE, PEW POLL FINDS

The weekly jobless claims report follows a worse-than-expected December jobs report. The economy added just 199,000 new jobs in November, below forecasts, although the unemployment rate dipped below 4% for the first time since the pandemic began.

The country’s soaring inflation is also being closely examined. Consumer prices grew 7% in the year ending in December, the fastest pace since 1982, according to a report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Following a two-day meeting, officials with the Federal Reserve signaled that the first interest rate hike in years is on the horizon as it moves away from its coronavirus-era monetary position to curb inflation. The consensus is that the first rate hike will come in March and will be followed by several more hikes this year.

The closely watched monthly jobs data, released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, also shows the unemployment rate soared to 4.4 percent from 3.5 percent, after months at a half-century low.

March's data represents the tip of the iceberg, however, since the survey was conducted in the first half of the month, prior to the pandemic's grip on the economy.

Since the jobs data is always backward-looking, economists prefer to look at longer time periods — such as the three-month average — to spot trends. However, the economy has undergone a head-spinning pivot in a matter of weeks.

While March's number far outpaced expectations of 100,000 jobs lost, economists and market participants are in agreement that the April jobs report, which will be released May 8, will better illustrate the havoc wreaked by the coronavirus on the workforce. Some economists are predicting the unemployment number could be as high as 20 million.

“April will be a disaster for labor markets,” Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays, told CNBC. “We still have two more weeks, and we’re probably looking at an unemployment rate of more than 10 percent in April.""

It's the first time since 2010 that the economy has registered a negative jobs number. By contrast, February's total was 273,000 jobs added.

With millions of Americans under ""shelter-in-place"" orders or lockdowns, businesses across the country have shuttered, forcing millions of people out of work and pushing up initial jobless claims to a staggering 10 million in the past two weeks.

On Thursday, weekly jobless claims data for the prior week showed 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment benefits.

That total calls into question even the best-funded states' ability to pay unemployment benefits over a sustained period, making it likelier than not that more federal intervention will be needed.

“There’s no avoiding a substantial rise in the unemployment rate, likely eclipsing the 10 percent level during the Great Recession,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com.

""The real, unanswerable question at this point is how many of these jobs come back after social distancing guidelines are relaxed and businesses reopen. We hope for the best but brace for the worst,” Hamrick said.

""We do not see activity returning to its pre-virus level until the end of 2021,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a research note on Friday."

Employers added 390,000 jobs in May, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 328,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.

SURGING INFLATION SQUEEZING SMALL BUSINESSES, GOLDMAN SACHS SURVEY SHOWS

Job gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in the pandemic-battered leisure and hospitality industry (84,000), professional and business services (75,000) and transportation and warehousing (47,000). Nearly every industry gained positions last month, with one notable exception: Retail, which shed nearly 61,000 jobs.

""This does not look like a labor market about to tip into recession,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at jobs review website Glassdoor. ""Job gains were healthier than expected and the labor force participation rate ticked up. Despite concerns about a slowdown and even a recession, the labor market’s fundamentals look healthy.""

Businesses are eager to onboard new employees and are raising wages in order to attract workers as they confront a labor shortage. There were roughly 11.4 million open jobs at the end of April – near a record high – while the number of Americans quitting their job is also well-above pre-pandemic levels.

But the strong labor market is in part fueling record-high inflation, as millions of workers are seeing the largest pay gains in years – the result of companies competing with one another for a limited number of employees. Earnings rose 5.2% in May from the previous year, much higher than the pre-pandemic average of 3%. There are signs that growth could be moderating though, with earnings climbing just 0.3% on a monthly basis, slower than Refinitiv expected.

With wages rising across the economy, many companies have reported passing on the cost to customers. Americans across the country are paying more for everyday goods including food, gasoline, cars and health care, which has eroded much of the pay gains that workers have seen. The rising prices have been bad news for President Biden, who has seen his approval rating plunge as inflation climbs higher.

Inflation has also forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at the fastest pace in two decades. Central bank policymakers lifted the short-term interest rate by 50-basis points in May and signaled that similarly sized hikes are on the table at forthcoming meetings in June and July.

The job growth in May is likely high enough to keep the Fed on track with its aggressive rate hike plan. Stocks fell after the report, reflecting fears of higher interest rates.

""The strong May figures will only encourage the Federal Reserve to stick to its course of more aggressive monetary tightening, as inflation remains near a 40-year high,"" said Andrew Viteritti, a senior member of the forecasting team at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The Fed's increasingly hawkish stance will likely create new burdens for businesses. Hiking interest rates tends to create higher rates on consumer and business loans, which slows the economy by forcing employers to cut back on spending. A growing number of Wall Street firms, including Bank of America, Deutsche Bank and Fannie Mae, are now forecasting an economic recession in the next two years.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged there could be some ""pain associated"" with reducing inflation and curbing demand but has pushed back against the notion of an impending recession, identifying the labor market and strong consumer spending as bright spots in the economy. Still, he has warned that a soft landing is not assured.

May 06 2022,"US economy sees healthy job growth in April as payrolls jump by 428,000",Fox Business,right,https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/april-jobs-report-2022,"The U.S. economy saw solid job growth in April, suggesting the labor market is still strong despite headwinds from rising interest rates, soaring inflation, a worsening labor shortage and fears of a slowdown.

Employers added 428,000 jobs in April, the Labor Department said in its monthly payroll report released Friday, beating the 391,000 jobs forecast by Refinitiv economists. It marked the 12th consecutive month that job gains topped 400,000. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, held steady at 3.6%, the lowest level since February 2020.

HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE MISSED THE MARK ON SURGING INFLATION

Job gains were broad-based, with the biggest increases in the pandemic-battered leisure and hospitality industry (78,000), manufacturing (55,000), and transportation and warehousing (52,000).

The labor force participation rate, a key measure of the active workforce, fell 0.2 percentage points in April to 62.2%, matching the lowest level recorded this year as the labor force shrank by 363,000 workers.

""The job market continues to plow forward, buoyed by strong employer demand. After just over two years of the pandemic, the job market is remaining resilient and on track for a return to pre-pandemic levels this summer,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at jobs review site Glassdoor. ""However, the job market is showing some signs of cooling as it turns the corner and the recovery enters a new phase.""

Businesses are eager to onboard new employees and are raising wages in order to attract workers as they confront a labor shortage. There were roughly 11.5 million open jobs at the end of March – the highest on record – while the number of Americans quitting their job has also climbed to a new high.

Millions of workers are seeing the largest pay gains in years, as companies compete with one another for a limited number of employees. Earnings rose 5.5% in April from the previous year, nearly double the pre-pandemic average of 3%. There are signs that growth could be moderating, with earnings climbing just 0.3% on a monthly basis, slower than Refinitiv expected.

Many of those gains have been eroded, however, by the hottest inflation in nearly four decades, which has pushed the price of everyday necessities like gasoline, clothing and food significantly higher.

The rising prices have been bad news for President Biden, who has seen his approval rating plunge as inflation climbs higher.

Inflation has also forced the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively. Central bank policymakers raised interest rates by 25 basis points in March and 50 basis points in May, and have signaled that more mega-sized hikes are on the table at coming meetings. Although there are growing fears that the Fed could inadvertently drag the economy into a recession with its tightening, Chairman Jerome Powell has argued the labor market and consumer demand are strong enough to prevent a downturn.

Friday's data may bolster that argument and likely solidifies the central bank's charted rate hike course, according to John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.

""Investors need confidence that the Fed won’t raise too aggressively and topple the economy into recession in their fight against inflation,"" Lynch said. ""Today’s report is balanced and may prove to dampen the extreme volatility of recent days. We’re still not out of the woods, yet a clearing is visible."""
Apr 23 2016,Obama Boasts In Britain: I Saved The World Economy As President,Breitbart News,right,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/23/obama-boasts-britain-saved-world-economy-president/,"President Barack Obama boasted of his legacy during a town hall in Britain, asserting that he single- handedly saved the world during his presidency.

“Saving the world economy from a Great Depression — that was pretty good,” Obama bragged when asked by a student in London what he wanted his legacy to be.

He recalled that when he visited London in 2009, the world economy was in a “freefall” because of irresponsible behavior of financial institutions around the world.

“For us to be able to mobilize the world’s community, to take rapid action, to stabilize the financial markets, and then in the United States to pass Wall Streets reforms that make it much less likely that a crisis like that can happen again, I’m proud of that,” he said.

Obama also touted his Iran nuclear deal as “something I’m very proud of” asserting that he successfully stopped their nuclear weapons program without going to war.

He griped that everybody forgot about his efforts in stopping the Ebola crisis, saving “hundreds of thousands of lives.”

“I think that I have been true to myself during this process,” Obama said, insisting that the things he said while running for office “matched up” with his presidency.

“I’ll look at a scorecard in the end,” he concluded. “Change takes time. Oftentimes what you start has then to be picked up by your successors or the next generation.”

He added that the fight for change was like a relay race and that he was prepared to pass the baton to his successor.

“Hopefully they’re running in the right direction,” he joked."
Jun 08 2016,"To grow the economy, grow small businesses: Bloomberg & Buffett",Guest Writer,not-yet-rated,http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/06/07/grow-economy-grow-small-businesses-bloomberg-buffett-column/85526778/,"Lloyd Blankfein, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett and Michael Porter

The economy has experienced 75 straight months — more than six years — of private sector job growth. Yet some areas still have not recovered all the jobs lost during the recession, and nationally, under-employment exceeds pre-recession levels. How can we increase the speed of job creation?

A critical part of the answer lies with America’s small businesses, which create over 60% of net new private-sector jobs and employ nearly half of America’s workforce. Helping them expand — to get their ideas off the ground — is one of the best ways to support economic growth and needs the continued focus of both elected officials and the private sector.

Political debates on economic growth tend to focus on taxes. But taxes are just one big issue facing small businesses. A report released by Babson College — “The State of Small Business in America” — underscores that fact. It provides a window into small businesses’ most pressing needs, and it can serve as a blueprint for addressing them.

As we’ve seen through Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, entrepreneurs across the country are facing barriers to growth. Based on a survey of over 1,800 small businesses, the report pinpoints four major challenges that cut across industries: the need for better access to capital, less burdensome regulations, more qualified workers and ability to better assimilate information technology. Let’s consider each.

Capital. Securing financing remains a major barrier to growth. The net result is that, across all sources, while the median funding request is $100,000, businesses typically secure just $40,500. Small business owners overwhelmingly rely on banks for funding, but banks face more stringent regulatory requirements that have restricted lending and made loans harder to obtain. Closing the gap between what businesses seek and receive would lead to more hiring, investment, and growth. It would also reduce the common practice of credit card borrowing, where high interest rates can lead to financial difficulties. Business owners suggest a reconsideration of terms, loan size and paperwork, and more than one in four call for increased transparency in the borrowing process. Policy discussions around credit access must recognize the need to balance the needs for both regulatory protection and economic growth.

Regulation. Nearly 60% of respondents have difficulty understanding and managing government regulations and laws. Companies spend about 200 hours annually on compliance. Governments should lessen this burden without compromising consumer and environmental protections. Streamlining agencies’ approval processes, for instance, can help small businesses open their doors sooner and expand more rapidly. In addition, simplifying the tax code would be a boon to small businesses, allowing them to spend less time and money on compliance.

Skills. Overwhelmingly, a major hiring challenge was finding employees with the right skillsets — a challenge even greater than salary requirements and competition for candidates. Small businesses are increasingly looking for tech-savvy workers who also have the required licenses and certifications. The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey identifies 5.8 million openings — the second-highest level on record — reflecting a mismatch between company needs and applicants’ skills.

More collaboration between state and local workforce development programs and the private sector can help address this skills gap, and community colleges have an important role to play, too. Programs and curriculum need to align with job needs in growing industries to ensure that graduates leave with the skills necessary to get hired. Some governments have begun subsidizing internships, recognizing there is no substitute for on-the-job training. Cooperative programs among small businesses in each industry can also share in the costs of professional development.

Technology. Small businesses recognize technology as essential to productivity and success. But accessing modern technology is perceived as costly and requires skills that many businesses lack. Better technology is also urgently needed to protect against the increasing threat of cybercrime, which 40% of respondents are not prepared to handle. In fact, one in five have been victims of cybercrimes, part of a disturbing global trend in which businesses are becoming hackers' preferred target. Given advances in the affordability of technology, technological literacy can be improved through increased access to resources, enhanced training and clearer government cyber-security standards.

Small businesses face other challenges, but progress in these four areas would provide a significant boost to local hiring — and to national economic growth. More than six years into a sluggish recovery, we must do more to help small businesses drive a new generation of growth — and put the next generation of Americans to work.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP

Presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders want to tear up your student loans and set you financially free. That's popular among voters – especially those struggling to pay off this debt.

Other Democratic candidates have more modest plans. But economists say the dramatic proposals from Sanders and Warren to free millions of Americans from the burden of student debt could boost the economy in significant ways and help combat income inequality.

Warren would forgive up to $50,000 for most people. Sanders would go further with total loan forgiveness. But with these plans having a price tag north of $1 trillion, such legislation would come with plenty of risks.

The reason debt forgiveness could have a big impact on the overall economy is that a generation of Americans is making major life decisions differently because of student loans.

""Children, it's not about if you want them,"" says Laura Greenwood in Montpelier, Vt. ""It's about can you afford them?""

Greenwood works for the state education agency. She's 30 years old and makes $63,000 a year. ""I make probably a better salary than a lot of my peers.""

But after paying for college and grad school, Greenwood owes $96,000 in student loans. And she says that's got her and her partner feeling frozen. ""Yeah. It's always, we're interested in having kids, but just cost of living and all our other bills and then the student loans, it's just like the final straw."" She says it makes starting a family feel impossible.

So if people like Greenwood suddenly had this millstone of debt lifted from their necks, it stands to reason that would unleash pent-up desires and spending that would be good for the economy. A lot more people would have kids, or start businesses, or buy houses.

""In the short term, it would be very positive for the housing market,"" says Lawrence Yun, the National Association of Realtors chief economist. He says his group's surveys show that student debt has people delaying homeownership by five to seven years.

He's not endorsing any particular plan, but he estimates that broad loan forgiveness would push up the number of home sales quite a bit. ""Home sales could be, say, 300,000 higher annually if people were not saddled with large student debt."" Yun says that would be ""a boost to the housing sector as well as the economy.""

The effects would go beyond the housing market. William Foster is a vice president with Moody's, which just did a report on student debt forgiveness. ""There've been some estimates that U.S. real GDP could be boosted on average by $86 billion to $108 billion per year,"" which is ""quite a bit,"" he says. ""That's if you had total loan forgiveness."" Foster says it wouldn't have to be total forgiveness to see significant results. And he says it could also help address rising income inequality.

""Student loans are now contributing to what's perceived as lower economic prospects for younger Americans,"" Foster says. After all — millions of people are delaying homeownership. And that's the most powerful way for most working and middle class people to build wealth.

""A typical homeowner has net worth about $230,000, while a typical renter has only $5,000,"" Yun says.

But while the idea of loan forgiveness is enticing, it would not be free. And this is a big reason plenty of politicians and policy experts are not on board. This would be expensive. Foster says Americans owe a lot of money on those student loans. ""About 1.5 trillion. And that's more than auto loans and credit cards. They're the second-biggest debt item for households.""

Foster says most of these loans are from the federal government, and it could forgive them. But that would mean giving up the $85 billion in annual revenue it's currently collecting on these loans. And, he says, ""That would result in a wider fiscal deficit.""

Also, taxing people to make up the difference would be a drag on the economy. Economists say whether the boost from the stimulus of debt forgiveness was stronger than the drag from raising the revenue another way would depend on the details of the legislation should it come about.

And there are other issues. Many people would oppose a giveaway to, say, lawyers and doctors who stand to make a lot of money in the future but happen to have a lot of student loan debt. And you probably wouldn't want to tax the working class to pay for higher-income college graduates' loan forgiveness. That's why presidential candidates are proposing to tax the wealthy to pay for it — which, by the way, Foster says would also create less drag on the economy from the taxes because wealthy people's spending patterns are less influenced by such changes than people in lower income brackets.

Foster says there could also be what's called a moral hazard factor here for future students. ""Those students might expect future loan forgiveness and therefore they'll take out even more money than they might have otherwise.""

That could create even greater levels of student debt. So there are plenty of potential pitfalls in all this. But policymakers who are pushing for loan forgiveness say they have plans to make it both fair and good for the economy and to do it in a way to make education more affordable for future students so they wouldn't have to take on so much debt."
Mar 22 2021,Biden Team Preparing Up to $3 Trillion in New Spending for the Economy,New York Times (News),left,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/22/business/biden-infrastructure-spending.html,"WASHINGTON — President Biden’s economic advisers are pulling together a sweeping $3 trillion package to boost the economy, reduce carbon emissions and narrow economic inequality, beginning with a giant infrastructure plan that may be financed in part through tax increases on corporations and the rich.

After months of internal debate, Mr. Biden’s advisers are expected to present the spending proposal to the president and congressional leaders this week, as well as begin outreach to industry and labor groups. On Monday, Mr. Biden’s national climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, discussed his infrastructure plans — and their role in combating climate change — in a meeting with oil and gas industry executives.

Administration officials caution that details remain in flux. But the enormous scope of the proposal highlights the aggressive approach the Biden administration wants to take as it tries to harness the power of the federal government to make the economy more equitable, address climate change, and improve American manufacturing and high-technology industries in an escalating battle with China.

The $1.9 trillion economic aid package that Mr. Biden signed into law this month includes money to help vulnerable people and businesses survive the pandemic downturn. But it does little to advance the longer-term economic agenda that Mr. Biden campaigned on, including transitioning to renewable energy and improving America’s ability to compete in emerging industries, like electric vehicles. Administration officials essentially see those goals — building out the nation’s infrastructure and shifting to a low-carbon future — as inseparable."

Mar 23 2020,"Democrats Block Coronavirus Bill That Provides Lifeline To Economy, Families",The Daily Wire,right,https://www.dailywire.com/news/breaking-democrats-block-coronavirus-bill-that-provides-lifeline-to-economy-families,"Democrats blocked a massive $1.8 trillion stimulus spending bill to protect the U.S. economy and provide relief to American families who are suffering as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

“The fate of a sweeping government rescue package to prop up an economy devastated by the coronavirus pandemic was in limbo on Sunday after Democrats blocked action in the Senate,” The New York Times reported. “The 47-47 vote was a stunning setback for a package that was emerging as the largest economic stimulus measure in modern American history – now expected to cost $1.8 trillion or more.”

The Times noted that the Democrats’ decision to block the bill sent U.S. stock futures tumbling to the maximum limit on Sunday evening. The Times further added that Republicans and Democrats had agreed that the plan was “crucial” to stopping economic fallout from the outbreak of the coronavirus as the bill would have sent $1,200 in direct payments to millions of Americans and would have provided lots of additional benefits.

Townhall political editor Guy Benson reported that Senate sources said that Democrat House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was responsible for tanking the bill.

“Talking to some Senate GOP sources. They seem stunned and angry,” Benson said. “I’m told there was lots of bipartisan input into the legislative outline & emerging specifics – including an agreement in principle on broad strokes. Then Pelosi showed up and threw a partisan grenade.”

“One source thinks D leadership decided crisis provided big opportunity to pack goodies into bill, so bipartisan process/momentum broke down,” Benson added. “Economists believe there is no time for a partisan standoff. But here we are. D’s counting on media cover & ‘corporations’ talking point.”

Numerous other notable political and media figures also noted that Pelosi was responsible for ruining the bill.

Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Brian Riedl tweeted: “The Senate Democrats just engaged in one of the most cynical displays of partisanship I have ever seen in the U.S. Senate. They let Pelosi blow up a bipartisan agreement. And they’ll get away with it too by denying what was in the agreement.”

Democrats tried to claim that the bill was a corporate bailout and a slush fund and did not protect workers, which is misleading.

Part of what Democrats have used to try to make the claim was a component of the relief package that gives the Treasury Department the power to distribute $500 billion in emergency federal loans to states, cities, and businesses.

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (LA) tweeted: “Now is NOT the time for politics. Senate Dems & Nancy Pelosi need to quit playing political games & support the Coronavirus relief bill they co-wrote in the first place. Enough is enough. Lives are at stake. The economy is at stake.

Apr 09 2020,Immigrants seize pandemic as opportunity to prove worth to U.S economy,Washington Times,right,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/apr/8/immigrants-coronavirus-pandemic-essential-economy/,"In New York, a group of illegal immigrant women pushed out of their jobs as domestic workers during the coronavirus crisis are sewing homemade face masks, giving themselves a way to earn cash to remain here.

Out west, illegal immigrants continue to be the backbone of farm work — essential workers shielded from shelter-in-place orders so they can keep food flowing to grocery stores.

Meanwhile thousands of illegal immigrant “Dreamers” here under the Obama-era DACA program are nurses, some of them even working the front lines of the fight to treat COVID-19 patients.

Coronavirus is the ultimate proving ground for illegal immigrants, they believe — a chance to show they are as American as anyone else, sharing the same experiences and just as, if not more, integral to the economy. After the shared crucible of coronavirus, they feel, the lesson should be that ousting them would be not only economically suicidal, but immoral.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom says he’s pondering how to give illegal immigrants state support, after they were left out of the federal stimulus bill. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot issued an executive order Tuesday allowing them to access the city’s coronavirus-related relief programs.

Some Democrats in Congress agree, and say the next big piece of legislation should give illegal immigrants access to the same coronavirus cash payments as citizens and legal workers. President Trump has said it’s “something we’re working on.”

Illegal immigrants and DACA recipients say they deserve more.

“Immigrants of all statuses are helping to stop the spread of this virus,” said Edison Suasnavas, a DACA recipient who works as a molecular oncology specialist. “Instead of ripping our families apart, the Trump Administration and Congress must act immediately to provide us, and our families, with a path to citizenship and the long-term stability we deserve.”

While not handling COVID-19 work yet, he says the testing lab is right next door to his, and he’s been told he could be roped in as the workload increases. He spoke to reporters Wednesday on a conference call organized by the National Immigration Forum.

Another part of the equation is the migrants who’ve been left jobless. The Migration Policy Institute says immigrants are overrepresented in hospitality, child care and cleaning jobs, which have been among the sectors hardest-hit by the shelter-in-place orders.

One of those is Maribel, an illegal immigrant who cleaned homes in Staten Island, until coronavirus social distancing sent New Yorkers scrambling to cancel her appointments.

She and other domestic workers are now sewing masks, using donated textiles, in a project coordinated by La Colmena, an immigrant-rights organization.

“Even though they are losing their jobs, they are not letting this crisis stop them from providing for their families,” said Yesenia Mata, executive director of La Colmena. “They know they can’t rely on the federal government for help and they are confronting this crisis with resiliency.”

Some Democrats had tried to cover illegal immigrants in the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill Congress approved last month. House Democrats also tried to automatically extend visas and work permits for guest-workers and those on temporary forgiveness programs such as DACA.

Those efforts faltered, but Democrats have signaled they’ll try again.

Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Massachusetts Democrat, said this week that illegal immigrants must be able to access federal coronavirus assistance. And Senate Democrats have introduced a bill to carry out the automatic work permit renewals.

Rosemary Jenks, vice president at NumbersUSA, which advocates for stricter immigration controls, Americans should be the priority for those jobs, particularly at a time when so many have been laid off and are searching for work.

“The home countries of the illegal aliens likely would much appreciate their contributions, as they all face a pandemic, too,” she said.

A reporter last week prodded Mr. Trump on whether “undocumented” immigrants deserved stimulus aid.

“How do you suppose they survive during the COVID-19?” the reporter wondered.

“You’re saying ‘undocumented,’ meaning they came in illegally,” the president told her. “And a lot of people would say we have a lot of citizens right now that won’t be working. So, what are you going to do? It’s a tough thing. It’s a very terrible — it’s a very sad question, I must be honest with you. But they came in illegally. And we have a lot of people that are citizens of our country that won’t be able to have jobs.”

Still, he added, “I’m not going to give you a hard and fast answer because I just want to tell you, it’s something I think about and it’s something we’re working on.”

If the feds don’t act, Mr. Newsom in California said he’s looking at having the state pony up to provide benefits.

“Californians care deeply about undocumented residents in this state,” he said.

Peggy Noonan, former speechwriter for President Reagan, said illegal immigrants’ response amid coronavirus should answer the complaints of many opponents of legalization, who say they need to pay fines and go through checks to prove they’ve earned the right to stay.

“Ladies and gentlemen, look around. They did,” she wrote in the Wall Street Journal.

Mark Krikorian, executive director at the Center for Immigration Studies, counters that the country doesn’t owe illegal immigrants anything.

“Most of them aren’t rapists or anything like that, but they are all trespassers,” he said.

There’s also a debate over how much of a role immigrants do play in key areas like health care.

The Center for American Progress says there are 29,000 DACA workers in health care, though Steven A. Camarota, the research director at Mr. Krikorian’s organization, says many of those are home health-care aides or other assistants, who don’t require any specialized training. He said those jobs could easily be filled by others.

CAP’s own numbers show there are only a few thousand DACA recipients who are actually registered nurses or medical technicians. In a population of about 3.3 million nurses nationwide, that means DACA migrants make up only 1 in every 1,000, Mr. Camarota said.

Mr. Krikorian said the one area where illegal immigrants do play an outsized role is farm work, where they pick fruits and vegetables that are sold fresh — as opposed to the mechanized picking for processed farm products.

“Although that makes up a relatively small portion of our caloric intake, the current crisis exposes how vulnerable that sliver of our food supply is, so once the immediate crisis passes, the government needs to make a concerted effort to wean farmers off the use of foreign labor,” he said.

He said more broadly, the coronavirus crisis shows why it’s “unwise” to have a large illegal immigrant population.

“Situations like this require all of us to pull together, and that’s a lot harder to do when so many people living here are interlopers, who either infiltrated our borders or lied about leaving when their lawful visits were over,” he said.

But he acknowledged the problem has grown too big to settle by ousting all the illegal immigrants, and there will have to be a legalization for “established illegals, provided it’s balanced.”

That means stricter enforcement such as verifying workers and ending sanctuary cities, and “deep, permanent cuts in future legal immigration, to close out this chapter of our immigration history.”

Mar 06 2020,"Blowout: U.S. Economy Added 273,000 Jobs in February",Breitbart News,right,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/03/06/february-jobs/,"The great American jobs creation machine is firing on all cylinders, with February’s jobs figures showing far more strength than expected and both January and December being raised higher than previously reported.

The U.S. economy added 273,000 jobs in February and the unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, the government said Friday.

Economists had forecast 175,000 nonfarm payroll growth and the unemployment rate to tick down slightly to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent the prior month.

Average hourly earnings were up by 3 percent compared with a year ago. The average workweek climbed a bit to 34.4 hours.

December’s estimate of payroll growth was revised upward by 37,000 to 184,000. January’s number was revised up by 48,000 to 273,000. That adds a total of 85,000 more jobs than had previously been reported putting the three-month moving average at 243,000 jobs

The labor market has been a bright spot for the American economy in recent months, with unemployment at or near 50-year lows and the economy continuing to add hundreds of thousands of jobs month after month. The strength of the labor market has boosted consumer sentiment and consumer spending, keeping the pace of economic growth stronger than in many of the other major economies around the world.

The coronavirus is widely expected to slow economic growth this year, although the impact may be short-lived if the outbreak is contained or fizzles out after a few months. The Labor Department said there was no sign that the outbreak had hurt employment in February. The strength of the labor market, however, may bolster the economy’s ability to withstand the pressure."
Feb 18 2020,"On economy, Trump picks a fight with Obama he cannot win",MSNBC,left,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/economy-trump-picks-fight-obama-he-cannot-win-n1137896,"Yesterday morning, Barack Obama published a tweet marking an important anniversary. Alongside an image of a bill bearing his signature, the former president wrote, ""Eleven years ago today, near the bottom of the worst recession in generations, I signed the Recovery Act, paving the way for more than a decade of economic growth and the longest streak of job creation in American history.""

The Democrat's message had the benefit of being true. Roughly a month into his presidency, with the economy falling off a cliff and the nation hemorrhaging jobs, Obama signed into law an economic stimulus package, which Republicans said would never work. Almost immediately, the employment landscape improved; the Great Recession gave way to a recovery; and the economy hasn't stopped growing or adding jobs since.

That's not opinion or spin; it's just what happened.

Obama's successor, however, still desperate for credit for a recovery he did not create, was unimpressed with the tweet. Last night, Donald Trump published one of his own.

""Did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression, despite Zero Fed Rate [and] MASSIVE quantitative easing. NOW, best jobs numbers ever.""

I can appreciate why Trump is sensitive about this. He's based his entire presidency -- and re-election campaign -- on the idea that he's singlehandedly responsible for creating an economic nirvana unlike any ever witnessed by humans. If Americans knew the truth, the Republican's political standing would be even worse than it is now, which leads to ridiculous tweets like these featuring demonstrably false claims.

Reality, however, is stubborn. When it comes to economic growth, for example, there has been no ""boom"" under Trump. In fact, American GDP growth has fallen short, both of growth rates from Obama's second term and of growth rates Trump promised to create before taking office.

The same is true of job numbers. While the current president claimed yesterday that we're seeing the best job numbers ""ever,"" the truth is fewer jobs were created during Trump's first three years than during Obama's last three years. What's more, no individual year from Trump's tenure has shown job growth that matches the best years from Obama's second term. There's also the inconvenient fact that in 2019, U.S. job growth slipped to an eight-year low.

Again, that's not opinion or spin; it's just what happened.

The Washington Post published an interesting analysis in the fall taking a broader view of the Trump-vs-Obama debate.

There’s no telling Trump that the economy is anything but sensational under his stewardship, of course, and there’s no telling him that it’s doing well for any reason other than his stewardship. Generally speaking, the economy is doing well, though there are ongoing concerns that the economic boom is slowing. But given Trump’s habit of comparing his performance to history, we thought it was worth comparing economic metrics under Trump to the second term of the last guy to hold Trump’s job: Barack Obama.

I have a hunch the White House didn't care for the results of the report. Comparing the economy under Obama and Trump at the same points in their presidencies, the Post found that the economy grew faster under Obama, hiring grew faster under Obama, the S&P 500 grew faster under Obama, the unemployment rate shrunk faster under Obama, and the national debt grew slower under Obama.

The analysis concluded, “[I]f we are linking economic numbers to presidential performance, Trump’s insistence that his abilities are unparalleled are rendered somewhat suspect in that he ranks second out of the last two presidents on a lot of these indicators.”

As we discussed at the time, it’s worth emphasizing that it’d be wrong to suggest the economy is bad under Trump. It’s not, at least not yet. But the more the Republican tries to convince people that he’s responsible for the greatest economic boom since the dawn of humanity, the more relevant it becomes that he hasn’t yet matched Obama’s record of success."
Feb 09 2020,"Views of Nation’s Economy Remain Positive, Sharply Divided by Partisanship",Pew Research Center,center,https://www.people-press.org/2020/02/07/views-of-nations-economy-remain-positive-sharply-divided-by-partisanship/,"How we did this For this report on views of the nation’s economy, we surveyed 12,638 U.S. adults in January 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology.

The public’s views of the nation’s economy remain more positive than at any point in the past two decades. In addition, more Americans say President Trump’s policies have made the economy better (44%) than worse (29%), while 26% say they have not had much effect.

The public’s ratings of economic conditions turned much more favorable shortly after Trump took office in 2017, as a result of a surge in positive views among Republicans. These attitudes have shown little change more recently.

Today, 57% of Americans rate the national economy as excellent (16%) or good (42%). This is virtually unchanged from last September, when 56% of the public held positive views of the economy. A third of the public views economic conditions as only fair; just 9% say the nation’s economy is in poor shape.

The national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 6-19 among 12,638 adults, finds that views of the economy – and the impact of Trump’s policies – continue to be deeply divided along partisan lines.

Currently, 81% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the economy is excellent or good. These views have changed only modestly over the past two years. But between November 2016 (just before Trump’s victory in the presidential election) and March 2017 the share of Republicans with a positive view of the economy approximately doubled, from 18% to 37%. And by November 2018, they had doubled again, to 75%.

By contrast, Democrats’ assessments of economic conditions have changed only modestly since before Trump took office. Currently, 39% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say conditions are excellent or good. In November 2016, 46% had a positive impression of the economy.

Overall, the public holds more positive than negative views about the impact of Trump’s economic policies. While 44% say that the president’s economic policies have made economic conditions better, 29% say they have made the economy worse; 26% say Trump’s policies have not had much of an effect.

Views of the nation’s economy 1992-2020 In recent years, Pew Research Center has transitioned from probability-based telephone surveys to the American Trends Panel, a probability-based online panel. The transition from phone surveys conducted with an interviewer to online self-administered surveys brings with it the possibility of mode differences – differences arising from the method of interviewing. Over the last several years, the Center has tracked perceptions of economic conditions on both telephone and web surveys. Mode differences in perceptions of the economy are fairly modest. In the January survey conducted on Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, on which this report is largely based, 57% say the economy is excellent or good; 33% say economic conditions are only fair, while 9% say they are poor. In a contemporaneous telephone survey, conducted Jan. 8-13 among 1,504 adults, 51% say conditions are excellent or good, 34% say they are only fair, while 14% say they are poor. And in the summer of 2019, 57% rated economic conditions positively on the ATP, while 55% did so on a phone survey conducted a few weeks earlier. Partisan differences in positive perceptions of the economy are about as wide on the online panel survey (42 percentage points) as on the telephone survey (45 points). Both Democrats and Republicans are somewhat more likely to express positive views of the economy on the telephone survey as online. (For more on the transition from telephone surveys to online panel surveys, see “Trends are a cornerstone of public opinion research. How do we maintain them when there’s a shift in survey mode?”)

Public views of how Trump’s policies have affected the economy are more positive than they were for Obama’s policies at the same point in his presidency, when overall assessments of the economy were much more negative than they are currently. In February 2012, roughly equal shares said Obama’s economic policies had made things better (33%) and worse (35%); 25% said they had not had much effect. At that time, only 11% of the public rated the economy as excellent or good, with overwhelming majorities of both Democrats (84%) and Republicans (94%) rating the national economy negatively.

However, optimism that conditions would improve was relatively high eight years ago. Today, public outlook for the economy a year from now is mixed: Currently, 29% of Americans say conditions will be better, 26% worse, while 45% say they will be about the same as now. In February 2012, 44% expected economic conditions to improve; just 10% said they would get worse, while 42% said they would be about the same as they were then.

Opinions about the impact of presidents’ policies and the future course of the economy also are highly partisan. In the current survey, an overwhelming share of Republicans (80%) say Trump’s policies have made economic conditions better. Democrats are divided: Nearly half (48%) say Trump’s policies have had a negative impact, 38% say they have not had much of an effect and 14% say they have helped the economy.

Views about the state of the economy a year from now are somewhat less partisan, but while nearly half of Republicans (46%) expect economic conditions in the U.S. to be better a year from now than they are today, just 15% of Democrats say the same.

Demographic differences in views of economy

Overall, 57% of Americans say current economic conditions are excellent or good, but these views vary across demographic groups: older people, those with higher incomes, men and whites are particularly likely to say the economy is in good shape, while these views are less widely shared among younger people, those with lower incomes, women, blacks and Hispanics.

These demographic gaps are little changed over the course of the last few years. Americans ages 65 and over are the most positive in their evaluations of the economy, with 70% saying it is in excellent or good shape. By comparison, about half of 18-29 year olds (47%) say the same. And while more than six-in-ten white people (64%) offer positive evaluations of the economy, that compares with roughly half of Hispanic people (49%) and just a third of black Americans (33%).

There is a 12 percentage-point gender gap in these views: 64% of men say the economy is doing well, compared with 52% of women. And while 64% of college graduates say economic conditions are excellent or good, 54% of those without a college degree say the same.

Views of the economy also differ starkly by income. Among those with annual family incomes of $100,000 or more, 72% have positive views of the economy, with one-quarter rating it as excellent. Roughly two-thirds of those who make $75,000-$99,999 (65%) and $50,000-$74,999 (64%) rate the economy as excellent or good.

However, less than half of those who make less than $30,000 (44%) rate the economy positively, with just 10% saying they rate the economy today as excellent.

Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, a large majority (81%) rate the economy as excellent or good. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to view the economy positively: 88% do so, including 41% who say the economy is in excellent shape. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, 72% offer positive ratings, with 18% saying economic conditions are excellent.

Overall, 39% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents rate the economy as excellent or good, and there are only modest ideological differences in these views.

While majorities of Republicans in all age groups offer positive ratings of the economy, older Republicans and Republican leaners are much more likely than younger Republicans to do so: 90% of Republicans ages 65 and older rate the economy positively, while 68% of those under 30 say the same.

Among Democrats and Democratic leaners there is only modest variation in these views by age, although Democrats 65 and older view the economy more positively than those under age 65 (47% vs. 37%).

In both parties, those with higher incomes and those with college degrees are more likely to say current economic conditions are excellent or good. And the partisan gap is similar across all educational and income levels. For instance, 89% of Republicans with a college degree rate the economy as excellent or good, compared with 47% of Democratic college graduates – a 42 point gap. Among those without a college degree, the gap is nearly identical (45 points).

Across income and partisan groups, high income Republicans are the most likely to see the economy as in excellent or good shape, while low income Democrats are least likely to say this. But partisanship is a bigger factor than income in these evaluations: In fact, Republicans with incomes of less than $30,000 (69%) offer significantly more positive ratings of the economy than Democrats with incomes of $100,000 or more (52%).

Views of economy, Trump strongly related

Opinions about the state of the nation’s economy are correlated with views of Trump’s job performance. People who have the most positive views of economic conditions – the 16% of adults who say the economy is excellent – overwhelmingly approve of Trump. Nearly nine-in-ten (86%) approve of his performance, including 76% who strongly approve.

Yet those who say economic conditions are good are not nearly as supportive of Trump. Half of this group approves of his job performance, with only about a third (36%) strongly approving.

In part, this reflects partisanship in views of both the economy and Trump. For instance, among Republicans who view the economy as good (half of all Republicans and leaners), 82% approve of Trump’s job performance. But among the roughly one third of Democrats who give the economy the same rating, only 11% approve of Trump’s performance.

Among the 15% of Republicans who rate conditions as only fair, a narrow majority (55%) approves of his job performance. Among Democrats who view the economy as only fair, just 4% approve of the job Trump is doing."
Dec 05 2016,Left Pretends Trump Inheriting Strong Obama Economy,Breitbart News,right,http://www.breitbart.com/california/2016/12/05/left-pretends-trump-inheriting-strong-economy/,"With President Obama, Democrats and their media fellow travelers having failed to win the hearts and minds of voters, they are now trying to build a legacy on the big lie: “The president is handing his successor an economy that’s now the envy of the world.”

David Corn of the progressive Mother Jones magazine claimed on November 7: “the election is a referendum on the explicit use of hate in politics — a reckoning toward which the GOP has been hurtling for half a century.” But Donald Trump won by campaigning on making the election a referendum on President Obama’s failed economic policies.

The 2016 election results were the worst performance by the Democrat Party since the 1870s. Republicans now hold the presidency, both houses of Congress, 33 governorships and control of both legislature chambers in 32 states. The Democrats only control both legislature chambers in just 13 states.

Middle class voters, especially in “flyover country,” came to believe on November 8 that the Obama administration’s economic recovery was the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s, according to Peter J. Ferrara of the Heartland Institute.

Ferrara suggests that despite $6 trillion in deficit spending during President Obama’s first term, median household income after inflation fell by more than $4,500, about the equivalent of losing one month’s pay per year. He adds that after another $4 trillion in deficit spending in Obama’s second term, after-inflation median household income did stabilize. But the average American family would have $17,000 more in annual income if 8 years of the Obama recovery had equaled the average recession recovery since World War II.

But the Obama administration continues to claim that pushing the unemployment rate down from 10 percent will be the centerpiece of the outgoing president’s legacy. Jason Furman, Chairman of Obama Administration’s Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on December 2, “I didn’t think I’d ever see the unemployment rate that low,” after the Labor Department reported that the November unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent.

But more than half of that supposed decline during the Obama Administration was due to the equivalent of about 7.5 million Americans giving up looking for a job or dropping out of labor force. Furthermore, the current level of part-time employment, at 18.3 percent (about 27.8 million), is a higher percentage than at any time since the Great Depression.

One advantage for Democrats of having a lousy recovery for workers, is that the interest rates stayed so low that U.S. house prices just hit a new all-time-high.

But most of those gains went to the rich. The percentage of families that own a house dropped from 67.5 percent, when President Obama first took office in January 2009, to 62.9 percent in November. The last time the rate of home ownership was that low was 1966, when Lyndon Johnson was President.

George Friedman, founder of Geopolitical Futures. commented after the election that it was the disbelief that Trump, as an amateur populist, could even compete, is the “reason Hillary Clinton lost.” The Democratic Party “that Franklin D. Roosevelt crafted or that Lyndon B. Johnson had led” abandoned its core white working-class voters, which Trump proved are “single largest ethnic and social group in the country.”

Friedman observes: “Liberals are concerned with inequality. People in the lower-middle class are simply concerned with making enough money to live a decent life. They are two very different things.”

Friedman credits Trump for also understanding that “these people had lost the culture wars that had been waged for the past generation.” Their churches and parents raised and taught them “gut values.” The pride that comes to the lower- and middle-class from working hard and making a good living for their families was lost had been displaced. In order to be politically correct, the “values they were taught as children could no longer be expressed in public.”

Democrats and their media allies are working hard to build a legacy of the Obama administration’s accomplishments. But Friedman suggests the election demonstrated that the “middle-class group no longer had a place in the Democratic Party” that only has contempt for them."
Jan 02 2017,"A Stronger Economy Will Also Destroy Jobs, but It’s Necessary",Reason,right,https://reason.com/archives/2017/01/02/a-stronger-economy-will-also-destroy-job,"In South Africa, people who speak Afrikaans use the word ""robot"" to mean the same thing it means in English. But it is also the word for ""traffic light."" Why? Before automated signals, motorists on busy streets were directed by police officers standing on platforms. Those cops were automated out of a job.

This bit of trivia comes from the dazzling new book Bourgeois Equality: How Ideas, Not Capital or Institutions, Enriched the World, by University of Illinois at Chicago economist and historian Deirdre McCloskey. She points out that automation and robots are nothing new, that they are crucial to raising living standards and that the jobs they destroy are always replaced by better ones.

Today, cars are built partly by robots, which reduce the need for human workers. Notes McCloskey, ""Compared with horses, cars themselves are 'robots.' Yet the advent of cars did not produce mass unemployment because of insufficient demand for the output of blacksmiths and horse traders.""

Cars had many beneficial effects—expanding the choices and improving the comfort of humans, who once had to rely on other types of transportation. The spread of the horseless carriage also created jobs for traffic cops, at least for a while. Maybe some of them later went to work in factories making traffic lights.

In the near future, Republicans plan to implement policies to unleash economic growth that allegedly has been hobbled by Barack Obama. They believe a simpler tax code, lower tax rates, fewer regulations, stern immigration enforcement and the repeal of Obamacare will lift the economy to dizzying heights. In the ensuing boom, Donald Trump would have us believe, unemployed coal miners, factory workers and other blue-collar Americans will find themselves in great demand.

They shouldn't get their hopes too high. To raise economic growth, not to mention wages, you have to make workers more productive. You don't make employees more productive by forcing them to work harder or demanding that they be smarter. You do it by providing them with advanced machinery, which lets each employee produce more in less time.

When you do that, though, the immediate effect is to destroy jobs, not create them. This process raises fears, illustrated by the late business consultant Warren Bennis' droll prediction. ""The factory of the future,"" he said, ""will only have two employees, a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.""

But pessimistic forecasts have been around a long time and have never come true. The process of change eliminates positions in one sector but creates them in others. In 1950, 20 million Americans lived on more than 5 million farms. Today, we have 2.1 million farms with just 3.2 million people.

Yet U.S. farms feed far more people than they did before. And millions of Americans whose parents or grandparents toiled in the fields now work at other jobs that didn't exist back then, making more money than their ancestors could have dreamed of.

Computers have had a similar effect on secretarial jobs, eliminating more than 3 million of them since 2001. But who would trade their laptops and smartphones in order to put people back to work typing, filing and answering phones?

American manufacturing has produced more and more with fewer and fewer workers. Since 2001, the number of manufacturing jobs has fallen by nearly one-third, while total output has risen by more than a quarter.

Conservative policymakers celebrate the vigorous growth of the Reagan years, which they intend to replicate. What they don't mention is that in the 1980s, manufacturing employment fell by 7 percent, and workers with no more than a high-school education suffered a decline in real earnings—even as those with more education saw their pay increase.

The simple truth is that faster economic growth means more rapid change in the workplace, rendering old jobs and skills obsolete. For most people, over the long term, this process is clearly beneficial, but a significant number suffer. The answer is not to stop progress but to facilitate the movement of the displaced into new occupations or places where jobs abound.

The next administration may or may not succeed in speeding up economic growth or restoring jobs in old industries. But it can't succeed in both. To pretend otherwise is to write a check that can't be cashed.

The unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, a new post-recession low, though part of that stemmed from a shrinking workforce. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight For 12 months in a row, the United States has added at least 200,000 jobs — a sustained pace of hiring unmatched since 1994 and 1995. The net job growth in February was above market expectations, despite a frigid winter in the Northeast.

The latest data “demonstrates the resilience and breadth of the current labor market recovery,” Scott Anderson, a chief economist at Bank of the West, said in an e-mailed analysis.

For the 12th month in a row, the nation added more than 200K jobs, extending a labor market boom that is powering the economy. (Video: Reuters)

Though the U.S. economy is still well short of a full-scale lift-off, the latest numbers underscore the way in which job growth, combined with an oil price dive, is driving a once-sluggish recovery. Americans have more jobs and more money to spend, all while cheaper energy is causing a drop in prices. That combination — which yields a virtuous cycle of greater demand and labor expansion — leaves the United States well ahead of the listless advanced economies of Europe and Asia.

But the recovery is still a fragile one, particularly because wages have been flat for years and consumer spending could pull back if energy prices again climb.

Markets opened lower in Friday morning trading, with all three major indexes slightly down amid speculation that the Federal Reserve may increase interest rates by midyear.

The lack of wage growth has proven the biggest mystery of the economic upturn. Normally, a tighter labor market forces employers to compete for employees — and raise their pay. But so far, there has been no sign of upward pressure on wages, despite months of predictions that an improvement is just around the corner.

Wage growth was modest in February, and average hourly earnings ticked up by 3 cents, to $24.78. In nominal terms, that’s a 2 percent improvement from one year ago. Wage growth has hung around that level, or slightly below, for much of the recovery. The flat wages are particularly troubling, because the economy is now adding high-paying, as well as low-paying, jobs. For food service workers and engineers alike, the raises are not coming.

“We’ve been thinking we would have seen [wage growth] by now,” said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. “That is the one missing piece of the recovery.”

The unemployment rate is at a level where, historically, wages have pushed upward. But this time around there are millions on the margins. Some are stuck with part-time jobs because they can’t find full-time jobs. Others are part of the “shadow unemployed” — those who are too discouraged to even look for work and therefore are not counted in official unemployment numbers.

""I think there’s still some slack"" in the labor market, Department of Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said Friday in an interview. ""We’ve made some tremendous progress, but we have more work to do. America works best when we field a full team, and there’s still too much talent on the bench.""

It’s unclear if those workers will again reenter the job market, and in February the civilian labor force actually shrank by about 180,000. There was also little change in the number of long-term unemployed.

Still, some companies are deciding to spend more to retain their workers. Wal-Mart last month announced that it was raising wages for roughly half a million of its lowest-paid employees. Retailers T.J. Maxx and Marshalls soon followed suit. Those wage increases will take effect in the coming months and were not reflected in the latest data, released by the Department of Labor.

“In my view, the balance of power is changing,” Frank Friedman, Deloitte’s interim chief executive, said in a telephone interview. “And it’s gone from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market. The buyer, of course, being companies. And now I’d say the employee has a lot more power.”

As part of the latest numbers, the Department of Labor revised downward its job growth estimate for January, from 257,000 positions to 239,000. Still, the United States has added 3.2 million private jobs over the last 12 months, the best figure since 1998.

In February, job growth was slightly less broad-based than in previous months. Employment in mining declined over the month, and manufacturing saw only modest gains. Meanwhile, the food and drinking services sector added 59,000 jobs, nearly double the monthly average established over the previous year. Growth in that industry indicates that consumers are spending savings at the pump on relatively smaller items, rather than on cars or washing machines.

In the latest quarter — October through December — consumer spending accounted for more economic growth than at any point since 2006, according to a separate batch of data released last week.

Year-on-year, domestic prices are down 0.2 percent, meaning the nation is seeing modest deflation. Take out energy and food, known for their price volatility, and prices are still up only 1.6 percent over the year — below the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target."

In the space of a few hours, he declared that his own central bank chief was an “enemy,” claimed sweeping powers not explicitly envisioned by the Constitution to “order” American businesses to leave China and, when stock markets predictably tumbled, made a joke of it.

Mr. Trump’s wild and unscripted pronouncements on Friday renewed questions about his stewardship of the world’s largest economy even as he escalated a trade war with China before heading to France for a high-profile summit with the leaders of many of the world’s other major industrial powers.

Even some of his own aides and allies were alarmed by his behavior, seeing it as the flailing of a president increasingly anxious over the dark clouds some have detected hovering over an economy that until now has been the strongest selling point for his administration. They privately expressed concern that he was hurting the economy and was doing lasting damage to his own prospects for re-election."

As candidates hit the campaign trail, NPR looks at four major issues the next president will face from Day 1 in office.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy Michael Hall Courtesy Michael Hall

For seven years, Michael Hall has been guiding tourists to the top of Seattle's Space Needle and back. It's a unique vantage point from which to watch the ups and downs of Americans' paychecks.

At first, the 30-year-old elevator operator shared in the success of the popular attraction. He got regular raises, thanks to a union contract. Then the contract ran out. Hall's pay hasn't budged in the past four years.

At first, Hall said, ""I could put some money into savings every check. Still go out, grab a beer. But after about two or three years, suddenly it was like there's seven of us in a house. And then finally I started to find myself, about a year ago, living paycheck to paycheck.""

It's a familiar story. Most Americans still aren't seeing big raises, even though the job market is slowly recovering.

In April, the official unemployment rate dropped below 5.5 percent for the first time in seven years. But the problem of stagnant wages goes back a lot further. Since 1979, average wages have barely kept pace with inflation.

John Pallaoro, a self-employed truck driver, says his paychecks stretched further four decades ago.

""I was able to purchase a suburban house in the mid-'70s for the price of barely one year of wages, two years at the most,"" Pallaoro recalled. ""My standard of living is probably reduced by 50 percent from 40 years ago.""

Stagnant wages aren't just a problem for individuals. When workers like Hall and Pallaoro don't have money to spend, it's a drag on the whole economy.

Experts point to a variety of causes for wage stagnation, including sluggish productivity growth. In the first decades after World War II, Americans' productivity climbed steadily, nearly 3 percent every year. But in the mid-'70s, that growth downshifted to less than 2 percent.

""One obvious lesson is it's better to be growing fast than to be growing slow,"" said James Pethokoukis, an economic policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.

""The default Republican position would be you need to reduce taxes, you need to reduce spending so more of America's economic resources are being run by the private sector,"" he said. ""And that would boost economic growth.""

Other proposals such as education reform and increased investment in public works are also intended to boost productivity. But that's not the only challenge.

Since the 1970s, there's been a disconnect between productivity and wages, so even as workers produce more, they don't necessarily see the benefits.

""We have created lots of income, lots of output, lots of wealth over the last three decades,"" said Larry Mishel, president of the left-of-center Economic Policy Institute. ""The problem is it has not accrued to the vast majority.""

Virtually all of the gains have gone to those at the top of the income scale. In the past, politicians have sometimes tried to address that through the tax code: taking a slightly larger cut from the wealthy and using tax credits to pad the pockets of the poor. But there are political limits to that approach. Some people consider such government redistribution akin to adding or taking away points after the whistle has blown. Mishel and others argue that policymakers need to focus more on shaping the rules of the economic game, so average workers can command higher pretax wages.

""The problems with people's paychecks is not what the federal government is taking out in taxes. It's what employers are not putting in,"" Mishel said.

Elevator operator Hall agrees. He complains that while his paycheck has flat-lined for the past four years, business at the Space Needle has been up, up, up.

""We're busier than we ever were,"" Hall said. ""One full elevator, that pays most of us working for the day. And we'll do that 100 times. It's sort of insulting that they can't afford to keep paying us enough to live in the city.""

There is one stretch in the past 35 years that offers a glimmer of hope for struggling workers. That's the late 1990s — a period when not only was the economy growing fast but the gains were widely shared, so workers on every rung of the economic ladder were climbing together.

""What was distinct about that period can be summarized in two words: full employment,"" said economist Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Or maybe three words: very full employment.""

Unemployment in the late '90s was below 5 percent. Some months it fell below 4 percent. That gave workers everywhere lots of leverage to demand higher wages.

Short of full employment, Bernstein says, there are other policies that could boost workers' bargaining power, including a higher minimum wage, steps to make it easier for unions to organize, and immigration policies that limit the growth of a shadow workforce.

Many of those policies will be debated over the next year and a half by those who seek to occupy the White House. As the U.S. economic elevator starts to climb again, a central challenge for the next president will be making sure more American families aren't stuck on the bottom floor."
May 08 2015,"US economy added 223,000 jobs in April",Vox,left,http://www.vox.com/2015/5/8/8572565/may-jobs-day,"The US economy added 223,00 jobs in April according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4 percent. Economists had expected 230,000 jobs and a 5.4 percent unemployment rate, so this is basically right on target. The two previous months' jobs reports were revised downward, removing 39,000 jobs.

A very expected jobs report

Really the only unusual or exciting thing about this jobs report is how unusual it is for something so thoroughly expected and non-game-changing to happen. Adding a bit over 200,000 jobs a month is both what analysts thought would happen, and also a trajectory that is consistent with a continued slow decline in unemployment but no real labor market boom.

Dive deeper into the data, and the basic lack of surprises only continues. Labor force participation is up, but only very slightly. Hourly wages are up, but only very slightly.

There's nothing about this jobs report that is likely to change the Federal Reserve's mind about anything, and therefore no reason to expect financial markets to have any particular reaction. Those who think the Fed's current course is dangerously inflationary will keep thinking that. Those who (more correctly!) think the Fed's current course is unreasonably inflation-averse will keep thinking that, as well. Janet Yellen will keep thinking she's on the right track.

Wages are very slightly growing

Wage growth appears to have settled into a steady pattern that is somewhat better than what we saw at the depths of the recession, but far below what was considered normal before the recession. Partially offsetting this, overall consumer price inflation has been abnormally low for a couple of years now. There are also some compositional effects pulling average wages down as a large cohort of inexperienced 20-somethings have been entering the workforce.

Overall it is a little difficult to understand why some of the small upward bumps have been interpreted in some quarters as a sign of an imminent inflationary breakout. Even the strongest wage-growth months have been weak compared with 2006 or 2007, years that were not exactly halcyon days for the American worker.

The economy is still not fully recovered

Perhaps the clearest sign of how not-yet-completed America's recovery comes from looking at the level of full-time jobs, which is still well below where it was in 2007:

The population, needless to say, has grown in the intervening years, meaning that the failure to fully catch up in job growth makes it difficult for rank-and-file workers to gain bargaining leverage."

Oct 12 2021,IMF slashes US growth forecast and warns of rising risks to the global economy,CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/12/business/imf-economic-outlook/index.html,"London CNN Business —

The global economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is weakening and risks are rising, according to the International Monetary Fund.

The IMF on Tuesday slashed its 2021 growth forecast for the United States by one full percentage point to 6%, the biggest reduction suffered by any G7 economy in its latest World Economic Outlook.

The cut reflects disruptions to supply chains and softening consumption in the third quarter, the IMF said.

The revision comes days after Goldman Sachs cut its growth forecasts for the US economy this year and next, citing weaker consumer spending and the winding down of the government’s Covid-19 relief programs.

The IMF now expects the global economy to grow 5.9% in 2021, 0.1 percentage points lower than the July forecast. The outlook for 2022 remained unchanged. Despite the modest revision, the organization said that economic risks have increased.

“Rapid spread of Delta and the threat of new variants have increased uncertainty about how quickly the pandemic can be overcome,” it said. “Policy choices have become more difficult, confronting multidimensional challenges — subdued employment growth, rising inflation, food insecurity, the setback to human capital accumulation, and climate change — with limited room to maneuver.”

Beware inflation and China real estate

The organization also cut its 2021 growth forecasts for China, Japan and Germany, the world’s next largest economies. It said that shortages of materials were weighing on manufacturing output in Germany, while in Japan emergency coronavirus measures implemented between July and September had dented the recovery.

China’s economy is expected to grow 8% in 2021, slightly less than the July forecast due to a scaling back of public spending, the IMF added. It also flagged “large scale, disorderly corporate debt defaults,” including in China’s property sector, as a risk to financial markets that could “reverberate widely.”

Overall, the balance of risks for the global economy is “tilted to the downside,” according to the IMF, which pointed to rising inflation fueled by higher commodity prices and mismatches between supply and demand following the pandemic.

Supply chain bottlenecks have led to shortages of a range of goods and astronomical increases in shipping costs, which are pushing up consumer prices. Although the IMF expects inflation to return to its pre-pandemic range across most economies next year, it said that a persistent supply-demand imbalance could keep prices elevated for longer, prompting central banks to hike interest rates sooner than expected.

Other risks to the growth outlook include a failure to lift the US debt ceiling, which could have “serious implications for financial markets,” it added.

Developing countries still grappling with the pandemic

The IMF was cautious about employment.

Disruptions to sectors such as hospitality and retail have caused the labor market recovery to “significantly lag” the recovery in economic growth in most countries, it said. Lower levels of employment are expected to persist, reflecting “possible lingering health concerns, replacement income under furlough schemes or unemployment benefits cushioning income loss, and the accelerated shift to automation.”

Labor markets in developing economies have been hardest hit. At the same time, large disparities in vaccine access and government support between richer and poorer countries is creating a “dangerous divergence in economic prospects,” IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath warned.

“The outlook for the low-income developing country group has darkened considerably due to worsening pandemic dynamics,” she added.

While almost 60% of people in advanced economies are fully vaccinated, with some individuals now receiving booster shots, about 96% of the population in low-income countries remains unvaccinated, according to the IMF.

That has significant implications for the pace of the recovery globally. Whereas output in advanced economies is expected to return to levels projected before the pandemic hit by 2022, output in developing economies is expected to remain 5.5% below pre-pandemic forecasts in 2024, resulting in a larger setback to improvements in living standards."

For a while, things seemed to be looking up, and there was talk about green shoots of recovery. But now growth is stalling, and the specter of deflation looms.

If this story sounds familiar, it should; it has played out repeatedly since 2008. As in previous episodes, the worst news is coming from Europe, but this time there is also a clear slowdown in emerging markets — and there are even warning signs in the United States, despite pretty good job growth at the moment.

Why does this keep happening? After all, the events that brought on the Great Recession — the housing bust, the banking crisis — took place a long time ago. Why can’t we escape their legacy?

The proximate answer lies in a series of policy mistakes: Austerity when economies needed stimulus, paranoia about inflation when the real risk is deflation, and so on. But why do governments keep making these mistakes? In particular, why do they keep making the same mistakes, year after year?"

On a tiny island off the coast of China, one company manufactures a product used across the globe for countless household products as varied as PCs and washing machines.

And as that island — Taiwan — worries about the threat of a standoff between the US and China, the world's economy holds its breath. That's because there could be trillions of dollars' worth of economic activity tied to that one company: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's biggest chipmaker.

Industry watchers say an escalating dispute between the US and China over Taiwan could drag down the global economy, given the fact that no other company makes such advanced chips at such a high volume. If TSMC goes offline, they say, the production of everything from cars to iPhones could screech to a halt.

""If China would invade Taiwan, that would be the biggest impact we've seen to the global economy — possibly ever,"" Glenn O'Donnell, the vice president and research director at Forrester, told Insider. ""This could be bigger than 1929.""

What is TSMC?

While TSMC may not be a household name, you almost certainly own something that's powered by its chips.

TSMC is in the foundry business, meaning it doesn't design its own chips but instead produces them at fabrication plants for other companies. The company accounts for over half of the global semiconductor market, and when it comes to advanced processors that number is, by some estimates, as high as 90%. In fact, even the best chip from China's top semiconductor manufacturer, SMIC, has been said to be about five years behind TSMC's.

TSMC counts Apple as its biggest customer, supplying the California tech giant with the chips that power iPhones. In fact, most of the world's roughly 1.4 billion smartphone processors are produced by TSMC, as are about 60% of the chips used by automakers, according to The Wall Street Journal.

TSMC semiconductors are also used in high-performance computing: They can quickly process reams of data and guide missiles, making the company highly valuable in the eyes of government entities.

As TSMC has grown to dominate the industry, it has automatically become an oligopoly, according to William Alan Reinsch, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a national security think tank.

""When you have a very complex, very sophisticated, and very expensive technology where barriers to entry are very high — I mean, building a fab plant is in the billions — you can't just decide tomorrow, 'Well, I'm going to go into that business,'"" he said. ""It's not like making tea.""

How did we become so reliant on chips made in Taiwan?

The semiconductor industry has its roots in the US, as much of the research and development is done on US soil. Companies in other countries license the US-made technology.

Dylan Patel, a chief analyst at the semiconductor research and consulting firm SemiAnalysis, pointed to the Dutch company ASML as an example: ASML produces high-end chipmaking equipment, but one of the technologies for which it's best known was invented in the US National Laboratories.

Over the past 30 years or so, manufacturers in developed countries concluded it was in their best interest to outsource the manufacturing of the chips, according to Reinsch.

""You build a big factory and you crank these things out by the thousands, and you do it in a low-wage, nonunion country that probably doesn't have environmental requirements,"" he said. ""You keep all the design and IP at home and you do all your sales, marketing, and service at home, and that's where you make the money.""

It's this approach that has directly led to the growth of chip foundries like TSMC and reduced production on American soil, Reinsch said.

According to a 2021 report from the Semiconductor Industry Association, in 1990 the US produced 37% of the world's chip supply. These days, the US is responsible for only 12% of global chip production.

Why is this a problem now?

As the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine have illustrated, having too much reliance on certain countries can upend supply chains when disruptions arise. It's for this reason that many US corporations are exploring ""onshoring"" — moving some of their manufacturing to the US — to make their supply chains more resilient.

The US's access to TSMC chips, however, is especially vulnerable, because though Taiwan is self-governing, China claims the island as its own and has threatened to invade. Controlling Taiwan is central to Chinese President Xi Jinping's goal of achieving a ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"" by 2049, the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.

While the consequences of an invasion could be significant, many experts say it's just a matter of time before it happens, whether it's by 2030, 2025, or even by the end of next year. On Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken predicted China would take steps to annex Taiwan on a ""much faster timeline"" than previously thought, signaling that it could be sooner rather than later. The US government is already playing out war-game scenarios to prepare for this, and in the event of a full invasion it would reportedly consider evacuating the skilled chipmaker engineers on which it's become so reliant.

The spotlight has focused increasingly on Taiwan and the semiconductor industry as a whole in recent weeks following the export regulations the US government slapped on China. Those regulations limit sales of semiconductors made using US technology and are meant to curb China's ability to develop advanced technology.

The US and China are now locked in what Patel described as ""a full-scale bilateral economic cold war,"" one that's likely to have severe financial repercussions, especially given how intertwined the semiconductor supply chain is.

What would happen if China invaded Taiwan?

Taiwan hopes its semiconductor business will protect it from Chinese aggression — government leaders have called the industry a ""silicon shield"" against invasion.

But if China did invade, disrupting the world's access to chips, ""the entire global economy comes to a screeching halt,"" O'Donnell from Forrester said. ""Semiconductors have become almost like the oxygen of the global economy,"" he said. ""Without the chips, you can't breathe.""

The effects of such a halt would be ""economically devastating,"" says Martijn Rasser, a former senior intelligence officer at the CIA who is now a security and technology expert at the Center for a New American Security, a left-leaning think tank.

""You'd be looking at trillions of dollars in economic losses,"" he told Insider.

The US National Security Council agrees, and in July the US commerce secretary said the US would face a ""deep and immediate recession"" if American businesses no longer had access to these chips.

Some experts have speculated that, in the event of an invasion, the chip-manufacturing facilities would be intentionally destroyed so China couldn't access them. In a US Army journal article published in December, the academic Jared McKinney described this strategy as the ""broken nest"" — another way to put it is mutually assured destruction.

The destruction of those facilities, or an inability to access their chips, could have major national security implications, Rasser said.

""Every military system that we rely on has a ton of semiconductors in them,"" he said. ""It would start impacting our ability to maintain existing weapon systems, upgrade ones, build new ones.""

Considering that the US has committed to defending Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, these hits to the US's defense capabilities could be especially significant.

But while a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would produce the most serious disruption, Rasser says it wouldn't necessarily take an invasion for the world's chip access to be blocked. As well as making investments in Taiwanese firms and poaching their workers, China could institute a blockade on the island that could cut off the world from semiconductor supplies.

What's the solution?

The US is taking some steps to make itself less reliant on Taiwan. In July, for instance, Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which includes nearly $53 billion in subsidies and tax breaks in an effort to bolster chip manufacturing in the US.

Some companies have already begun adding US facilities: Intel is building two $20 billion factories in Ohio, Micron has pledged to spend up to $100 billion on a massive chip factory in upstate New York, Samsung is building a $17 billion factory in Texas, and TSMC is constructing a $12 billion plant in Arizona.

TSMC is also building a new facility in Japan, one that will produce the less advanced chips needed in the auto industry. The Wall Street Journal reported that Japanese officials had signaled they'd like TSMC to expand its presence there by adding capacity for advanced chips as well, another sign global powers are growing wary of the geopolitical risk to Taiwan.

But O'Donnell warned it would be premature to celebrate an end to the chip shortage or to the US's reliance on Taiwanese chips. The factories themselves require equipment that's in short supply because of — ironically enough — the chip shortage. And besides, those plants take years to build and get online.

""Once you stick a shovel in the ground, you're not going to get chips for at least three years,"" he said.

Plus, there remain obstacles to substantially decreasing the country's reliance on TSMC. While the subsidies and tax breaks will help, Taiwan may continue to remain the cheaper option for businesses. And, for the time being at least, TSMC's chips are likely to be higher quality as well. Given that TSMC is ""really at the cutting edge,"" Rasser said, the chips produced in the US by Intel, for instance, ""wouldn't be as sophisticated"" as those made in Taiwan.

While producing even these lower-quality chips would go some way to reduce the US's reliance on Taiwan, the US has a shortfall of the skilled workforce needed to ramp up production, a problem companies in this industry are facing across the globe. Rasser says enhanced training and education will be necessary to fill this gap.

It's for these reasons that it could be ""years and potentially decades"" before the US will be able to declare independence on the chipmaking front.

""The CHIPS Act, it's a good step in the right direction, but it's just a little more than scratching the surface,"" Rasser said.

In the meantime, the US may have to cross its fingers that an economy-shaking disruption doesn't come to pass."
Feb 15 2016,"FACT CHECK: Republicans debaters on high court, economy",CBS News (Online),left,http://kval.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-republicans-debaters-on-high-court-economy,"WASHINGTON (AP) The Republican presidential debaters misfired in assertions about Supreme Court nominees, Syria, immigration and more.



A look at some of the claims Saturday night and how they compare with the facts:

TED CRUZ: ""We have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year.""

MARCO RUBIO: ""It has been over 80 years since a lame-duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.""

THE FACTS: Cruz is wrong. Rubio is in the ballpark.

Anthony Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate on Feb. 3, 1988, in the final year of Ronald Reagan's presidency, by a 97-0 vote. That was a presidential election year.

Presidents don't appoint justices to the high court; they nominate them for Senate confirmation. Kennedy was nominated in 1987 and confirmed the next year. That makes Rubio closer to correct.

Rubio and other Republicans argued that President Barack Obama, as a lame duck, should not fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia but leave it to the next president which they hope will be one of them.

But the example of Kennedy, who is still on the court, shows that presidents in their last year aren't always powerless in shaping the court and not shy about trying.

JEB BUSH: ""Russia is not taking out ISIS. They're attacking our team.""

DONALD TRUMP: ""Jeb is so wrong. You've got to fight ISIS first. ... We've been in the Middle East for 15 years, and we haven't won anything. We've spent $5 trillion in the Middle East.""

THE FACTS: Both spoke with too broad a brush. Russia is bombing both the Islamic State group and Western-backed rebels. But the U.S. and its partners say the majority of Russia's strikes haven't targeted IS fighters, and that its most recent offensive near Aleppo is primarily hitting ""moderate"" opposition forces.

As with most things in Syria, however, the picture is unclear because some of the moderates are fighting alongside other extremist groups, like the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front.

Trump's figure for total U.S. expenditures in the Middle East, though, appears significantly inflated. In November, Trump cited a $2 trillion figure. That number roughly matches the amount of money the U.S. spent fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq between 2001 and 2015, according to the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

CRUZ on a failed 2013 immigration overhaul: ""I stood with (Sen.) Jeff Sessions and (Rep.) Steven King and the American people to defeat that amnesty plan. The question for anyone on illegal immigration is, where were you in that fight?""

RUBIO: ""When that issue was being debated, Ted Cruz at a committee hearing very passionately said, 'I want immigration reform to pass, I want people to be able to come out of the shadows.' He proposed an amendment that would have legalized people here. ... So he either wasn't telling the truth then, or he isn't telling the truth now.""

THE FACTS: Rubio's account is mostly right. While Cruz has been against an explicit path to citizenship for people in the country illegally, he did introduce legislation in that 2013 bill that proposed eventual legal status for millions of people. He also publicly supported the legislation in the Senate and urged its passing.

He has since said his amendment was designed to help kill the broader bill. The immigration bill co-authored by Rubio failed to pass in the House.

___

RUBIO: ""Our economy is flat, it's not creating jobs the way it once did.""

THE FACTS: While the recovery after the Great Recession has at times been sluggish, in the past two years job creation has been healthy. In 2014, employers added 3 million jobs, the most in 15 years. Job creation slowed to 2.7 million last year still, the second-most since 1999.

___

CRUZ: ""The nonpartisan Tax Foundation estimated (my) simple flat tax that would produce 4.9 million new jobs, it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits.""

THE FACTS: That's a selective reading of the foundation's analysis, which found that his plan would reduce tax revenues by $3.6 trillion over 10 years, requiring massive spending cuts or hugely increasing federal budget deficits.

The right-leaning group did conclude that the plan would generate more jobs and growth. It assumed that the tax cuts would generate significant additional economic growth and therefore more revenue, an approach that not all economists agree with.

But even taking that potential extra revenue into account, the foundation still concludes Cruz's plan would lower revenue by $768 billion over the next 10 years.

___

TRUMP on Bush: ""He put so much debt on Florida, and he increased spending so much, as soon as he got out of office, Florida crashed.""

THE FACTS: Trump is right that Florida's economy tanked right after Bush left office, but he's wrong about the reasons. The state was clobbered by the housing bubble and bust that eventually dragged the whole country into the worst recession since the 1930s.

The bubble was particularly harsh in the ""sun and sand"" states of Florida, Arizona, Nevada and California.

Home prices jumped 160 percent in Florida during Bush's tenure from 1999 through 2006 more than double the national increase of 74 percent according to real estate data provider Zillow. Construction jobs surged and the boost to home values made many Floridians feel wealthier, leading them to spend more.

But home prices plummeted by half in the five years after Bush left office, according to Zillow data.

BEN CARSON: ""When we have a debt of that nature, it causes the Fed to change their policy. It causes the central bank to keep the rates low, and who does that affect? Mr. Average, who used to go to the bank every Friday and put part of his check in the bank and watch it grow over three decades and be able to retire with a nice nest egg.""

THE FACTS: Carson misreads how the Federal Reserve works.

The size of the U.S. government's debt, which is about $19 trillion, does not influence the Federal Reserve's interest rate policies. The Fed seeks to keep unemployment low and inflation at about 2 percent a year.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke cut the short-term interest rate the Fed controls to nearly zero in December 2008 before Barack Obama took office and kept it that way for seven years.

It is true that the policy has significantly lowered the interest rates on bank savings accounts, but many savers have benefited in other ways. The S&P 500 stock market index nearly tripled from March 2009, when the market bottomed during the Great Recession, through the end of 2015.

Are you on Telegram? Subscribe to our channel for the latest updates on Russia’s war in Ukraine. ArrowRight After talks with French President François Hollande at the Kremlin, Putin said, “We are ready to cooperate with the coalition which is led by the United States.”

It was the most forthright commitment to a joint effort between Russia and the West since Moscow’s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

But it was far from the declaration of a new grand coalition in Syria, potentially under United Nations auspices rather than American leadership, that Putin has proposed. The deep disagreement between Russia and the West over the future of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has not been put aside.

Hollande said France was ready to fight alongside Russia but added, “Of course, Assad cannot play any role in the future of this country.”

Since Russia intervened in Syria two months ago, Moscow and Washington have agreed on measures to “deconflict” their aerial operations there. But as each country pounds its targets in Syria, they have not worked in tandem in any way.

Hollande arrived in Moscow after meeting with President Obama earlier this week. The terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13 have led France to step up its operations in Syria and to seek some sort of workable agreement among the foreign powers involved there. The idea has not been warmly embraced by the United States, which has accused Russia of targeting Assad’s foes among the American-backed rebels, rather than the Islamic State.

Hollande said that he and Putin had agreed “to only carry out strikes against terrorists, only against ISIS, and only against jihadist groups.”

“It is important not to strike those groups who are also fighting against terrorists,” he said.

Putin has long argued that the Western powers, Russia and China all face a common Islamist threat, and he has made it clear that he resents what he sees as relative Western indifference to attacks on Russia. He also has suggested that the United States has been negligent in taking the Islamist threat seriously enough.

The Paris attacks occurred shortly after a bomb brought down a Russian airliner on its way from Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh resort to St. Petersburg, killing all 224 aboard. On Thursday, Putin and Hollande commiserated over those attacks. The occasion gave Putin an opportunity to reiterate his argument about the common threat and about the need for the major powers to act in concert.

Putin has emphasized the fight against global terrorism as a means to repair, or at least reestablish, a meaningful partnership with the West.

“Our positions are the same,” Putin told Hollande before they began their private talks. “That forces us to join our forces in fighting terrorists. We are prepared to work with you, Mr. President.”

Hollande said, “I am in Moscow with you to figure out how we can act together in order to coordinate our actions to hit this terrorist group and look for political solutions for Syria.”

But cooperation between Russian and Western forces operating in and over Syria faces another significant hurdle: the growing animosity between Russia and Turkey. Russian officials on Thursday promised broad sanctions against Turkey, cutting joint investment projects and banning many Turkish companies from working in Russia.

Putin said that Russia assumed there would be “no repeat” of the Turkish attack against a Russian jet over the Syrian border this week, which left two Russian servicemen dead. He implied that the United States bore some of the blame, as the military-to-military communication over air operations in Syria should have prevented any misunderstanding.

He did, however, say that he and Hollande had agreed on “how we will cooperate in the near future, on a bilateral basis and with, as a whole, the coalition led by the United States.”

That would include where to launch strikes, Putin said.

In London, British Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday argued the case for extending Britain’s airstrikes targeting the Islamic State to Syria, telling Parliament that the group posed a “fundamental threat” to the security of Britain and that the United Kingdom should not “wait until an attack takes place here.” He added that British police and security services have foiled seven plots over the past year either linked to the Islamic State or inspired by its propaganda.

Cameron told Parliament that if Britain won’t act “when our friend and ally France has been struck in this way, then our allies in the world can be forgiven for asking: If not now, when?”

In 2013, Cameron lost a vote on possible military intervention against the Syrian government’s forces. But the next year, Britain approved airstrikes against Islamic State positions in Iraq.

On Thursday, Cameron stressed that there will only be a vote on a British air assault in Syria if it is clear that the majority of lawmakers are in favor of military action. A government defeat on the motion, Cameron said, would be a “propaganda coup” for the Islamic State.

Cameron’s Conservative Party has a majority of only 17, and the prime minister is seeking to persuade wavering lawmakers in his party and others to vote in favor of the strikes.

In a 36-page document he prepared for lawmakers, Cameron said: “It is wrong for the United Kingdom to sub-contract its security to other countries, and to expect the aircrews of other nations to carry the burdens and the risks of striking ISIL in Syria to stop terrorism here in Britain.” ISIL is an acronym sometimes used to identify the Islamic State.

Earlier in the day, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called for tough sanctions against Turkey that could bite into more than $30­ billion in trade between the two countries, as police in Russia began seizing Turkish products and deporting Turkish businessmen.

Russian officials are seething after Turkish F-16s downed the Russian warplane over the Syrian border. Turkey says that the Russian plane breached its airspace and was warned to turn back, assertions that Russia denies.

Putin, who described the act as “a stab in the back” from “accomplices of terrorists,” said in televised remarks Thursday that Turkey has not apologized over the incident.

It has become clear that the Russian government is directing its ire against the Turkish economy. At a cabinet meeting, Medvedev said that joint investment projects with Turkey would be frozen or canceled. Negotiations over a proposed preferential trade program with Turkey would also be scrapped, he said. Medvedev called for recommendations from government agencies to be submitted within two days.

“These documents will introduce restrictions and bans on the activity of Turkish economic structures in Russia, limiting deliveries of goods, including foodstuffs, labor and services from Turkish companies,” he said.

Russian Economic Development Minister Alexei Ulyukayev at the same session said that economic sanctions would affect TurkStream, the planned gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey announced by Putin last December, and the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant, Turkey’s first nuclear power plant, which Ankara signed an agreement with Russia to build.

He added that the sanctions may affect direct flights between Russia and Turkey.

Elsewhere, government agencies were busy. Rospotrebnadzor, Russia’s consumer oversight agency, announced it had seized 800 kilograms of “high-risk Turkish products,” including meat, candies and nuts.

And in the southern Kuban region, Russia’s Migration Service said it had arrested and would deport 39 Turkish businessmen who attended an agricultural expo on tourist visas.

Nov 05 2021,"Big rebound in jobs: America adds 531,000 jobs to the economy in October",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/05/economy/october-jobs-report/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

America’s jobs recovery gathered some steam last month as US employers added 531,000 positions in October.

The unemployment rate fell to 4.6%, the lowest level since the economic recovery started in May 2020.

The number of jobs added in October easily outpaced economists’ prediction of 450,000 jobs. It marked the first month since July that the official number didn’t undercut the consensus estimate.

The US economy gained jobs across the board last month, with leisure and hospitality, manufacturing and transportation and warehousing leading the job gains. The leisure and hospitality sector was hit hardest during the pandemic recession and is still 1.4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.

October’s jobs report marks a turning point after two months of sluggish job gains, slowed by rising coronavirus cases as the Delta variant raged across the globe.

“This is the kind of recovery we can get when we are not sidelined by a surge in Covid cases,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director at Indeed.

“The labor market is not yet fully recovered from the coronavirus-induced recession. But today’s report is a sign that recovery could be closer than many thought,” he said.

The nation has come a long way since the height of the pandemic. More than 18 million jobs have been added back since the recovery started, still leaving America short 4.2 million jobs compared with February 2020.

And the late summer months weren’t quite as bad as they initially appeared: The Labor Department revised August and September’s reports higher by a combined 235,000 jobs. The US economy added 795,000 jobs in August and September – not bad for a so-called lull.

People on the sidelines

That said, there are still millions of people sitting on the sidelines of this tight labor market, unable to rejoin the labor force because of care responsibilities at home or worries about contracting the virus.

The number of people who weren’t in the workforce but want a job stood at 6 million last month, still nearly 1 million higher than before the pandemic. The number of people who said the pandemic kept them from looking for work in October fell to 1.3 million from 1.6 million in September.

America’s labor force participation rate stood at 61.6% in October, still 1.7 percentage points before the February 2020 level.

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell noted the participation rate was a key point for the central bank’s assessment of the health of the recovering jobs market, and that it was still too low.

Although the recovery has picked up its pace, it remains uneven: The drop in the unemployment rate was led by job gains for men, particularly White and Hispanic workers.

The overall jobless rates for Black and Asian and workers were unchanged last month."
Feb 13 2021,Do ‘All the Economics Show’ That a Minimum Wage Increase Will Help the Economy?,The Dispatch,right,https://factcheck.thedispatch.com/p/do-all-the-economics-show-that-a,"In a recently released clip from his pre-Super Bowl CBS interview, President Joe Biden acknowledged that a $15 minimum wage wouldn’t be included in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, but he announced his willingness to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour in a separate effort, claiming that “all the economics show that if you do that the whole economy rises.”

The current federal minimum wage is $7.25, and while there is widespread support for raising the minimum wage among left-leaning economists and think tanks, such support isn’t as universal as Biden suggests. In 2019, for example, the conservative think tank the Economic Policies Institute published a survey of economists on their support for a $15 minimum wage. EPI performed similar surveys in the past and found similar results—including in 2015, when the survey was performed by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.

Critics of a higher minimum wage cite a number of reasons for their opposition: the effect on youth employment levels, the likelihood that it will increase the costs of products and services, and the chance that it will decrease the number of jobs available. Such concerns align with the data and projections published by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in July 2019. The CBO estimated that while a $15 minimum wage would increase the wages of 17 million workers and reduce the number of people living below the poverty line, it would also eliminate 1.3 million jobs. The CBO’s projections also indicated a $15 minimum wage would reduce business income while causing prices to increase, concluding that “the $15 option would reduce total real (inflation-adjusted) family income in 2025 by $9 billion, or 0.1 percent.”

Given the opposition to a $15 minimum wage among economists and the projections put out by prominent organizations like the CBO, Biden is wrong to claim that “all the economics” indicate raising the minimum wage to $15 would have an overall positive effect on the economy.

Apr 14 2015,IMF: Low oil prices will spur global economy,USA TODAY,left,http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/04/14/imf-growth-forecast/25722539/,"Paul Davidson

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON — Low oil prices are spurring faster growth in the USA and other advanced economies, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, projecting the global economy will expand by 3.5% this year.

That's up from 3.4% growth in 2014 as the pickup in the advanced nations offsets a slowdown in emerging markets. The IMF released the forecast as finance ministers and central bankers from 188 countries converge on Washington for this week's IMF-World Bank spring meetings. Global growth is likely to accelerate to 3.8% next year.

At a news conference, IMF Economic Counselor Olivier Blanchard described this year's growth as ""moderate and uneven.""

The IMF expects the U.S. economy to grow 3.1% in 2015, faster than last year's 2.4% pace, which was in line with its modest performance in the recovery. The latest estimate is below the organization's forecast of 3.6% growth in January after the USA suffered a weak first quarter. Nasty weather and a now-settled West Coast ports labor dispute delayed construction projects and disrupted shipments. Still, the USA remains a star among advanced economies.

In a report, the IMF said U.S. consumption ""has benefited from steady job creation and income growth, lower oil prices, and improved consumer confidence."" The organization also cited milder federal budget cuts and continued low interest rates, noting the positives are outweighing a strong dollar that's hampering U.S. exports and expectations that the Federal Reserve will hike rates this year.

Both advanced and emerging economies are struggling with aging populations, weak investment and sluggish productivity gains — all of which restrain growth, the IMF said. In emerging markets, ""the decrease in potential growth is even more visible,"" Blanchard said.

Two shorter-term forces are helping realign global economies, according to the international group, which promotes financial stability. Low oil prices are buoying oil-importing countries such as the USA and providing ""a boost to growth globally"" but hurting exporters, such as Russia. The muscular dollar is weighing down the U.S. economy but lifting the euro area and Japan.

""On net,"" Blanchard says, the currency movements are ""good news for the world economy."" He said the USA and China — which pegs its currency to the dollar — are economically healthy enough to weather the negative effects of the dollar's rise.

Still, he said, ""a world where you have large movements in exchange rates is a riskier world.""

The euro zone is projected to grow 1.5% this year, up from a 1.2% estimate in January. The region has battled anemic growth and deflation, or falling prices. It's ""showing signs of picking up, supported by lower oil prices, low interest rates and a weaker euro,"" the IMF said.

The feeble euro, especially in relation to the dollar, is lifting euro-area exports. A European Central Bank decision early this year to buy 60 billion euros a month in bonds through September 2016 — which has further lowered interest rates and the euro — ""is welcome,"" the IMF said. Blanchard said it's already having significant positive effects.

The risk in the region of another economic downturn ""hasn't gone to zero, but it has decreased substantially,"" Blanchard said.

Growth in Japan is aided by low oil prices and a weaker yen. After a sharp sales tax hike last year dampened consumer spending, the IMF expects growth of just 1% this year and 1.2% in 2016, but those estimates are each 0.4 percentage points higher than its January forecast.

In most advanced economies, including the USA, inflation remains weak. That's ""a particular concern for countries with crisis legacies of high debt and low growth, and little or no room to ease monetary policy,"" the IMF said.

Emerging markets are projected to grow 4.3% this year and 4.7% in 2016. Growth in China, the world's largest economy, is likely to slow from 7.4% in 2014 to 6.8% this year and 6.3% next year. Those estimates are unchanged from three months ago. After a rapid rise in credit and investment fed a real estate bubble, the Chinese government has sharply pulled back, leaving a sluggish housing market.

India is gaining momentum, and growth is projected to reach 7.5% this year, up from a 6.3% estimate in January."

Jan 17 2015,Janet Yellen has a huge opportunity to boost the economy,Vox,left,http://www.vox.com/2015/1/17/7559111/inflation-opportunity,"Friday morning, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices in the United States rose just 0.8 percent in 2014 — the lowest level since the crisis year of 2009. This will raise concern among economic wonks that inflation is running at a dangerously low level and undermining the ""credibility"" of the central bank's 2 percent inflation target. Meanwhile, normal people — jumping for joy at cheap gasoline and excited by the prospect of modest 1.6 percent price increases outside the realm of food and energy — will think the wonks are insane.

Here's a better way to think about it. The low inflation isn't a bad thing, exactly, but it's a sign that the Federal Reserve has an opportunity — one it's not necessarily taking advantage of — low interest rates.

The Fed has pegged short-term interest rates at a near-zero level for years, now. That's great news if you're looking to take out a mortgage or if you're a company looking for a loan to expand operations. It's also great news if you're an entrepreneur looking for venture-capital backing, because the very low returns on safe assets are pushing investors to look for bolder ideas to back.

Recently, most of the buzz from the Fed has suggested that they're looking to raise interest rates this spring in light of the improving unemployment rate.

The meaning of these inflation numbers is that there's no need to do this. The downside of low rates is the risk of high inflation, but there clearly is no risk of high inflation. So we can — and should — keep enjoying the benefits of low interest rates. Indeed, we could enjoy even more benefits if Janet Yellen would just say this clearly. People enjoy a little predictability in life, so interest rates that you know are going to stay low are much better than interest rates that just happen to stay low. A clear statement that interest rates will stay low until there is clear and convincing evidence that inflation has risen would help everyone feel more confident about their financing and business planning. And everyone could enjoy the best of both worlds — cheap consumer goods and cheap money to fuel investment and job growth for the future."
Oct 08 2021,"Another disappointment: US economy adds only 194,000 jobs in September",CNN Business,left,https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/economy/september-jobs-report/index.html,"New York CNN Business —

America’s economic recovery has hit a roadblock: US employers added only 194,000 jobs in September, another troubling sign that Covid is disrupting the economy.

It marked the second-straight month in which the US economy added far fewer jobs than expected. Jobs growth slowed down dramatically in August.

The unemployment rate declined to 4.8% in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday, down from 5.2% in August. Joblessness declined across the board, with the Black unemployment rate falling the most of any group – to 7.9% from 8.8% in August.

But if you’re an optimist, there is reason to be hopeful about the future: The surveys behind the jobs report were completed around the middle of September when Covid infections began to plateau. They have been on a steady decline since mid-September, a reason to be hopeful about job growth in October.

Have you lost your pandemic unemployment benefits? Tell us about it.

And the report did have some good news: The disappointing August report was revised higher by 131,000 jobs, which means employers added 366,000 the month before last. (Even so, the August report remained far below analysts’ initial expectations.)

“The weak jobs report shouldn’t be a surprise given the survey for it was taken near the peak of the Delta variant wave on September 12,” said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “Hundreds of thousands of jobs that could have been added in the leisure and hospitality industry alone had to wait until coronavirus infections and deaths dropped, as is happening now.”

Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor wouldn’t even go as far as calling the report a mixed bag.

“On the one hand, this shows us how big the impact from the Delta variant really was… but hopefully with the Delta wave receding the September report will be the worst of it,” he told CNN Business.

Mixed signals

In the late summer, rising Covid-19 infections from the Delta variant kept people at home. Many grew wary of spending time in large groups.

Hiring in restaurants and bars was thin last month as customers avoided travel and dining. Leisure and hospitality employers added just 74,000 jobs last month, far underperforming the industry’s monthly average gain of 197,000 this year. The leisure and hospitality industry bore the worst of the pandemic-linked layoffs last year.

Another sector that didn’t do great in September was education. Employment in local government education dropped by 144,000 and another 17,000 in state government education. Education is a major employer of women, so that added concerns about equality in the labor market recovery. Women lost 26,000 jobs last month, while men gained jobs.

But there’s some seasonal weirdness at work, the BLS warned in its report. Because the back-to-school hiring that normally occurs in September was lower this year, the seasonally adjusted jobs numbers showed a decline.

“Recent employment changes are challenging to interpret, as pandemic-related staffing fluctuations in public and private education have distorted the normal seasonal hiring and layoff patterns,” the BLS said.

We already know this pattern from last year, said Zhao, so it shouldn’t have come as a surprise.

“I think many schools are still running with a leaner workforce than before the pandemic,” Zhao said.

Hiring picked up at the end of the month, though, according to Frick, who expects that trend to accelerate through October.

What this means for the Fed

This jobs report was also important for the Federal Reserve. The central bank announced last month that it is getting ready to roll back its huge pandemic stimulus program by tapering its monthly asset purchases.

During the September monetary policy update, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he didn’t need the jobs report to be a “knock out” because he believes the labor market recovery was coming along nicely. Some of his colleagues, however, might still want to see further improvements, Powell said at the time.

While America’s labor market is still not back to its pre-pandemic strength, it has made up a lot of lost ground. Businesses are having a hard time finding staff, which is pushing up wages. Average hourly earnings over the 12-month period ending September grew by 4.6%, the biggest increase since February.

Whether Friday’s jobs gains will be enough to satisfy the policymakers remains to be seen. The Fed doesn’t meet in October. The next central bank meeting is in early November, with its policy decision to be announced on November 3."

Dec 03 2014,6 ways the oil price drop is great for the American economy,Vox,left,http://www.vox.com/2014/12/3/7319787/oil-economy,"Oil keeps getting cheaper, with a barrel costing about $30 less than it did three months ago. This is big news for the major oil producing countries, obviously, but it also has important — and dramatically positive — implications for the short-term American economic outlook. That's obvious if you're a heavy driver looking for some relief at the pump, but in truth the positive consequences are broad and widespread and the impact should be felt even by non-drivers.

Here are six ways cheaper oil is great news for the American economy.

1) Consumer spending will increase

Falling oil prices lead to lower gasoline prices, which leads commuters to have lower spending on fueling their cars. That leaves them with more money in their pockets to spend on other stuff. Studies of the impact of gasoline price increases tend to show a particularly marked impact on food spending. Higher gasoline prices meant less dining out and more food at home, and a shift in grocery purchases toward less expensive items. Cheaper gasoline should have the precise opposite effect.

Consumers will splurge more on their non-durable spending — buying pricier groceries and eating out more frequently. That's good news for grocers' and restauranteurs' profit margins, and it also means you should see more hiring in those sectors.

2) The job market will improve

In some times and places, a shift of consumer spending away from gasoline and toward other goods would simply lead to higher prices for those goods. But the American economy continues to exhibit a fair amount of labor market weakness, meaning that there is room for non-inflationary hiring. In other words, there are plenty of part-time workers out there eager for extra shifts and still a fair number of long-term unemployed looking for jobs.

With consumers paying less at the pump, they'll be demanding more locally produced goods and services and that demand will improve labor markets across the country.

3) Fuel-efficient car sales will decline

This doesn't necessarily make a ton of sense, but studies consistently show that consumers respond to short-term changes in gasoline prices by buying more or less fuel efficient vehicles. A 2009 study found that a $1 increase in gasoline prices boosts the market share of the most fuel-efficient new vehicles by 20%, while reducing the market share of the least-efficient vehicles by 24%.

A fall in gas prices should have the opposite effect.

This is bad news for Americans' lungs, but it's good news for GDP. For one thing, American car companies are relatively more specialized in gas guzzlers than are their Asian and German competitors. And a more subtle way this boosts the American economy is that many ""foreign"" cars are actually made in America these days, and that set of cars is also disproportionately tilted toward gas guzzlers. BMW, for example, makes all its X-series SUVs in Spartanburg, South Carolina but its sedans come from Europe. When Toyota sells a Prius to a North American customer, that car is made in Japan but when they sell an SUV or a truck it's made in Indiana or Texas.

4) Business profits will increase

So far we've mostly looked at how cheaper oil prices will improve the demand side of the economy by increasing sales of US-made goods and services. But cheap gasoline also improves the supply side of the economy. Suddenly every business that involves moving people (airlines, cab companies, buses) or goods (not just trucking and shipping directly, but all kinds of retail) has lower fuel costs and higher profits.

In some cases some of those profits will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices for things that aren't gasoline. In other cases, business owners will just pocket extra money. And in yet other cases, businesses will take advantage of lower costs to invest in increased production. Airlines might offer more flights, for example, as cheaper fuel makes previously unprofitable routes profitable again.

5) Oil boom areas will slow

There is one group for whom cheaper oil is bad news — oil producers, who've been having an amazing run between a combination of higher prices and surging American production. A 2013 Council on Foreign Relations report by Stephen Brown and Mine Yucel calculated the local job impact of rising oil prices, and we can flip their numbers to see the local impact of a price drop. The resulting map that I made above is probably a bit of an oversimplification, but it gives a good sense of the magnitudes involved. Long story short, it's good news for most places, but bad news for a few states.

And yet even here, the news is actually pretty good. Currently the unemployment rate in North Dakota is only 2.8 percent. In Midland, Texas at the center of that state's oil boom, it's 2.6 percent. In other words, employment should slow down the most in places where there are very few workers available to do jobs anyway. Oil boom areas have been experiencing rapid population growth, as job-seekers come to join the party. That trend will slow down or halt, but the people who would have moved to Bismarck in search of jobs will have an easier time finding them in Birmingham anyway so nobody has to suffer.

6) Most state budgets will improve

States normally tax retail sales on a percentage basis. If you buy $100 of stuff, you pay twice as much tax as if you'd only bought $50. One exception to that is gasoline, which is normally taxed on a per gallon basis rather than a per dollar basis. When gas prices fall, consumers spend less on gasoline but tend to actually buy more gallons. That means higher gasoline tax revenue.

At the same time, many of the savings at the pump will end up being spent on other stuff. That means higher sales tax revenue.

In major oil producing states, of course, this will be more than offset by declining direct revenues from the industry. But the vast majority of American states should see cheaper oil boosting their tax revenue without any tax rate increases. That will make it easier to keep tax rates and fees low, and or to hire new teachers and other workers."

Nov 04 2014,Will Democrats Be Able to Talk Seriously About the Economy in 2016?,HuffPost,left,http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-baker/will-democrats-be-able-to_b_6097806.html,"It looks like the Democrats will take another shellacking in the congressional elections this week. Part of this is due to factors like the normal falloff in voting in a non-presidential year and the weariness with a president after six years in office, which tends to cause the electorate to support the opposing party.

However, part of the reason for the shellacking is the Democrats' refusal to address the economic issues that trouble most of the public. As folks know who are either familiar with the data or live in the real world, the economy is still bad for most people. President Obama can rightly say that he inherited a mess from his predecessor, but at some point that does get old. He can also honestly blame the Republicans in Congress who have eagerly proclaimed their opposition to any economic proposal that doesn't have the primary purpose of making the rich even richer.

While the grim reality can offer legitimate excuses, the Democrats still suffered from the fact that they didn't have a real economic agenda for the bulk of the population. The Republicans at least have a clear agenda. Everyone knows if they get back in control they will give everything left on the table to the richest 1 percent. But what would the Democrats do?

We do know they would raise the minimum wage. This is good policy to get more money in the pockets of low income workers who can badly use a raise. It is also popular. Polls regularly show that large majorities of people across the political spectrum support increasing the minimum wage.

Still, a higher minimum wage doesn't offer anything to the bulk of the labor force whose wages will not be affected by plausible increases in the minimum wage. To these people the Democrats offered nothing but empty rhetoric and the public wasn't stupid enough to buy it.

There is no shortage of policies that the Democrats could be pushing which would help ordinary workers. To start with one that features prominently in the business press, the Democrats could take a strong position behind an expansionary monetary policy from the Federal Reserve Board. This means strong opposition to rate increases until there is clear evidence of inflation.

The Fed is independent and has to make its own calls, but it would help them make the right calls if they know that there are many in Congress who are prepared to insist the Fed follow its mandate for maintaining high employment. The Fed faces intense pressure from the financial industry to pounce on any hint of inflation.

The financial industry wants the Fed to raise interest rates to keep unemployment high and prevent workers from gaining bargaining power. It would be a nice switch if Democrats stood could say in public that the Fed should allow workers to get jobs and to gain some bargaining power.

Another switch would be if the Democrats could talk seriously about the trade deficit. Talk of restoring ""competitiveness"" is cute, but basically complete nonsense. No one in either party has any proposal that will make more than a marginal difference in the productivity of the U.S. economy any time in the near future.

If we want to get the trade deficit down then we have to get the value of the dollar down against the currencies of our trading partners. And this is not a question of beating them up for ""manipulating"" their currency. It is a question of negotiating where we give up things like enforcement of Microsoft's copyrights or Pfizer's patent monopolies in exchange for a lower valued dollar, and therefore more balanced trade.

Democrats also should be able to speak simple truths about national income accounting instead of being afraid in the way that Republicans are scared to openly endorse the theory of evolution. If we have a large trade deficit, the only ways we can get to potential GDP is either through asset bubbles that pump up investment and consumption or through government deficits. Like evolution, this is true.

Unfortunately the Democratic Party seems to be controlled by economics denialists. This will prevent it from having a coherent economic message.

Finally, a Democratic Party that hopes to have an appealing economic message for ordinary workers has to be prepared to attack Wall Street. This is not an abstraction. If the industry was forced to pay the same sort of taxes as other industries, as even the I.M.F. now advocates, and we broke up the big banks, it would go far towards ending the financial sector's drain on the rest of the economy. It would also go far toward reducing inequality.

In short, it is not surprising that voters are not happy with the Democrats. They do not have a program that offers real improvement in the average person's life. And the message that the other guy is worse apparently is not cutting it this year."

Andrew Cuomo. As he promotes his new, self-congratulatory book about navigating New York through its first coronavirus wave in the spring, he is also battling a new surge of cases.

He’s not been too happy. At a news conference in late November, he lashed out at his constituents.

“I just want to make it very simple,” he said. “If you socially distanced and you wore a mask, and you were smart, none of this would be a problem. It’s all self-imposed. It’s all self-imposed. If you didn’t eat the cheesecake, you wouldn’t have a weight problem.”

His blunt rhetoric exemplifies how political leaders — in Washington and in red and blue states — are responding to the Covid-19 crisis. They’ve increasingly decided to treat the pandemic as an issue of personal responsibility — much as our country confronts other social ills, like poverty or joblessness.

Yes, it’s absolutely critical that we wear masks and continue to keep our distance. But these individual actions were never meant to be our primary or only response to the pandemic."
Sep 06 2014,"Conflict, economy leave parts of Middle East in dark",USA TODAY,left,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/09/06/egypt-power-cuts/14861327/,"Sarah Lynch

Special for USA TODAY

CAIRO — Surgeons last month in an Egyptian hospital were 30 minutes into a hysterectomy when the operating room went dark — struck by a power cut. A generator should have kicked in. It didn't.

""The patient thought her life was ending,"" said Dr. Nader Mohsen Al-labede of the woman on the operating table, who was awake but numbed under spinal anesthesia.

Eventually the doctors calmed her down and operated for the next hour and a half with help from a handful of cellphones, Al-labede said. ""Thank God the patient is okay,"" he said.

This is not an isolated example of Egypt's, or the region's, new reality. Al-labede is among millions of people living and working in a part of the world where conflict and severe economic strife have led to regular power cuts that plunge hospitals, shops and homes into darkness.

Blackouts sent pangs of frustration surging through Egypt last year, fueling anger toward former Islamist president Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted in July 2013. They worsened this summer at the height of the sweltering heat, stemming from a range of factors: shortage of gas, poor maintenance of power plants, and state failure to pay debts to foreign oil companies. Egypt's leadership said militants have attacked electricity pylons, contributing to the difficulties.

On Thursday, a massive power outage stopped parts of Cairo's subway, took TV stations off the air and ground much of the country to a halt for several hours. On Saturday, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said the outage was largely due to crumbling infrastructure that needs billions of dollars and time to fix.

In a half-hour, nationally televised speech, el-Sissi asked the public to be patient and grasp the extent of the challenges faced to reduce such outages.

""We have said before that Egypt faces many challenges,"" he said. ""Electricity is like any other facility. It needs money and huge investment to fix. We must know this is not going to happen overnight.""



In neighboring Libya, challenges resound. Rival militias in the capital Tripoli have fought for control of the city's international airport since mid-July, affecting many aspects of life including power supply, residents say.

""I don't know how long I can actually withstand what's going on,"" said wedding photographer Amira Izruna. ""I don't want to be in a country that is so unstable for so long.""

Power outages usually hit Izruna's home for six hours a day and last up to 14 hours in parts of the capital. She can't edit her photos when the power is out. Almost half of the celebrations she planned to photograph may be postponed, she said, adding that her husband was going to shop for a generator.

In the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, people have grown used to cuts, which have been common during the summers since the 2011 revolution against dictator Moammar Gadhafi, said city resident Ahmed Amir Neihoum. He said power was out for a day recently in cities nationwide, reminding him of films depicting the end of the world.

""You cannot make any phone calls, you can't switch on the air conditioning,"" he said. ""There's a lot of stuff you can't do.""

The Gaza Strip has also struggled. Even before its recent war with Israel, power sources met no more than 70% of the population's need — dropping to 36% after the conflict was brought under control, according to Ahmed Sourani, Gaza program manager at Oxfam International.

Gaza's only power plant was hit by Israeli shelling, which also damaged transformers and electrical wires, hindering flows of power coming from Israel, he said.

Sourani also said sewage treatment plants are still not working at full capacity, causing sewage to flow into the Mediterranean Sea. Agricultural irrigation is suffering. Refrigerated medicines and vaccinations are going bad. And communication is hindered, he said.

""Life without electricity can hardly be managed,"" said Gaza resident Khalil Abu Shammala, director of the Al Dameer Association for Human Rights.

Baghdad, where stifling summer temperatures routinely hang above 110 degrees, has also suffered. Many people have generators, but the poor can't afford them, said Sami El Hilali, a resident of the Horreya district of Iraq's capital.

While Iraqis have been subjected to the problem since the rule of Saddam Hussein, electrical flows have grown more chaotic, he said.

""With Saddam, it would cut for three hours, then work for three hours — there was a system,"" he said. ""But there's no system in Iraq now. Now, it's terrible.""

In Lebanon, power cuts are so routine that apps for Apple and Android devices were created to let users track them. Now, an ongoing strike by electrical company workers threatens to make matters worse as limited state funds and increased demand from an influx of more than 1 million Syrian refugees has led to a rise in power rationing across the country, according to The Daily Star, a Lebanese newspaper.

In neighboring war-torn Syria, power cuts have hit Damascus, while some parts of Aleppo, shattered by two years of fighting, had no power at all at the end of June. Other districts had less than one hour a day, according to the United Nations. The problem contributes to worsening health conditions.

""Damaged water infrastructure, hot weather, overcrowded shelters and ​frequent power cuts have caused increasing water shortages and polluted water supplies, leading to recent outbreaks of waterborne diseases across the country,"" said an August report published by the Syria Needs Analysis Project.

As they always do on Labor Day, political candidates will begin their campaign sprint to Election Day.

And for years, they have been running on simple advice: ""It's the economy, stupid."" But this time around the track, they may discover that many Americans want to hear about other issues as well.

Wait. What?

The economy is not the No. 1 issue?

That's right. Gallup pollsters asked voters what was important, and the No. 1 topic turned out to be dissatisfaction with politicians. No. 2 was immigration. The economy had slipped to No. 3.

Given the depth of the recession and slow motion of the recovery, it can be almost jarring to realize that the U.S. economy no longer is in crisis mode. Despite a setback amid harsh weather this past winter, economists now say the recovery is advancing at a good clip.

Just last week, the Commerce Department revised its measure of total growth, the GDP, up to 4.2 percent for April, May and June. That very strong pace of expansion was two-tenths of a point higher than previously thought.

And the Conference Board's leading economic index's surged 0.9 percent in July, the sixth straight monthly gain.

""The big jumps in the leading economic index over the past couple of months indicate solid growth for the U.S. economy through the rest of 2014,"" Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Financial Services, said. ""The economy is close to firing on all cylinders.""

Of course for the millions of Americans who lost jobs or homes during the Great Recession, a true recovery may yet seem very far off. But for many households, life really is getting back to normal.

Here are some statistics to help understand how much has changed since the last midterm congressional election in 2010, when most people said the economy was ""extremely"" important in choosing candidates.

JOBS — In November 2010, voters were heading to the polls in a country that had been staggered by job losses. That month, the unemployment rate was at a frightful 9.8 percent. Currently, it's down to 6.2 percent.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that in June, the most recent month for which it has data, employers had 4.7 million job openings, the highest number in 13 years. And July marked the sixth straight month with new hires exceeding 200,000, the first such streak since 1997.

STOCKS — If you had money in a 401(k) retirement savings plan back in 2010, you probably were feeling sick to your stomach heading into that election cycle. On Labor Day of that year, the Dow Jones industrial average was still hovering around 10,500 — down dramatically from its 2007 peak of about 14,000.

But these days, the Dow is hovering around 17,000. In other words, your savings have recovered all that was lost in the financial crisis, and you're watching markets set new highs.

DEFICIT – In the 2010 election, a major issue was the exploding budget deficit. But in an update released last week, the Congressional Budget Office said the federal deficit is now shrinking faster than previously forecast because of sustained growth and low interest rates.

The deficit for fiscal 2014 is now projected to be $506 billion, or just 2.9 percent of gross domestic product. That is less than one-third of the deficit's recession peak — and below the average deficit level over the past 40 years.

GAS PRICES – Despite the turmoil in the Mideast, gas prices have remained tame this summer. Gasoline has been averaging around $3.43 a gallon, down by about a dime from last year. This will be the cheapest Labor Day driving period since 2010, according to AAA, the auto club.

AUTO SALES – In August 2010, new vehicle sales were slightly below 1 million. This August, J.D. Power and its partner LMC Automotive say total sales reached 1.5 million.

Other indicators involving housing and business investment also have been looking positive this summer.

So does all of this mean voters are in a cheery mood?

No. There's still lots to worry about. In fact, a new Rutgers study found that workers feel ""insecure, underpaid, highly stressed, and generally unhappy at work.""

Just as millions of older Americans never were able to shake off the financial and psychological impacts of the Great Depression, many people today are struggling to get back on track and feel confident again. The Rutgers study concluded that ""despite sustained job growth and lower levels of unemployment, most Americans do not think the economy has improved in the last year or that it will in the next.""

That kind of reaction is common in a downturn. For example, following the 1980-82 recession, pessimism lingered. In October 1984, during the Reagan administration, 63 percent of Americans said they thought the next generation would be worse off.

But polling shows that over time, a recession's impact starts to recede as new issues grab center stage. This summer's news has been filled with disturbing reports about immigration, the Middle East, Ukraine, Ferguson, Ebola, ISIS and even airplane catastrophes.

""Many more Americans now mention a non-economic issue — such as dissatisfaction with government, immigration or ethical and moral decline — than an economic one as the top problem,"" the Gallup poll concluded."
May 02 2019,"With economy humming, Democrats split over how to beat Trump",Christian Science Monitor,center,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Watch/2019/0501/With-economy-humming-Democrats-split-over-how-to-beat-Trump,"Dear reader:



“The 2020 election isn’t going to be close.” That was conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, writing in the Washington Post last weekend.



Mr. Hewitt’s confidence in President Donald Trump’s reelection boils down to one factor: the economy. Last year, many economic analysts were nervously predicting a recession on the horizon. Today, the economy is looking stronger by the day. And in the modern era, presidential elections have often tracked with the state of the economy.



Still, there are a number of factors working against the president. Mr. Trump is uniquely unpopular, the only president whose Gallup approval rating has never once reached 50% or higher, as CNN’s Chris Cillizza points out. His standing in key swing states is even lower.



In this context, former Vice President Joe Biden’s campaign message – casting the Trump presidency as “an aberrant moment” in the nation’s history – may be a shrewd move. Unlike many of his Democratic rivals, Mr. Biden is not running on the notion that the country has deep, systemic problems in need of dramatic overhaul. He’s running against Mr. Trump’s personal values and alleged character deficits.



Mr. Biden might as well don a blue cap saying: “Make America Great Again,” National Journal’s Josh Kraushaar wryly notes.



By taking this approach, the former vice president “deftly avoided wading into the ideologically driven conversation currently dominating the Democratic primary in favor of a broad anti-Trump message that’s embraced by all the party’s fractious factions, from the hard Left to anti-Trump Republicans,” Mr. Kraushaar writes.



Throughout the Trump presidency, Democrats have vacillated on precisely this question: Do they attack the president as an anomaly – someone who is unqualified to run the country, who has coarsened our national discourse and obliterated norms of presidential behavior? Or do they campaign against him the way they would against virtually ANY Republican – criticizing him for a tax policy that favors the wealthy, for rolling back regulations that protect the environment, for trying to strip health coverage from those who need it most, and so on?



To Mr. Biden, the president is the problem. To others in his party, Mr. Trump is the logical outgrowth of a corrupt status quo, embodied by modern Republicanism, that needs to change.



We’ll find out which vision Democratic voters prefer.



Let us know what you’re thinking at csmpolitics@csmonitor.com.

Iran's economy may be struggling, but that doesn't mean everyone is suffering.

In a downtown Tehran restaurant, a well-dressed young man who asks to be identified only as Ahmad sits with a friend enjoying a water pipe of flavored tobacco.

Ahmad is a bit vague about what he does — first he says he's in the petrochemical business, then describes himself as an independent trader. He shares the general consensus that President Hassan Rouhani has brought a better atmosphere to the country but no real economic changes.

Ahmad's own problems, however, might not elicit much sympathy from most Iranians.

""The regulations definitely need to be changed,"" he says. ""Take importing cars to Iran: The tariff is 105 percent on each car. I wanted to import two Mercedes, but you can only think about one.""

Income inequality is one problem Rouhani faces, but the Iranian president says better economic times are coming for his country. Iranians are desperate to believe him, but beyond the marginal improvements that come with greater confidence in the new administration, very little has changed on the ground.

Iranians are pinning their hopes on a nuclear agreement and better relations with the outside world — achievements seen as difficult at best.

Another major problem Rouhani faces in lifting Iran's economy is the opposition of entrenched interests that profit from Iran's isolation. For instance, the powerful Revolutionary Guard is a major economic player.

One graduate student who gives only his first name, Arman, says things hit a low point under former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

""What was really frustrating was the fact that nothing was ever going to get better, because the more sanctions there were going to be, the richer some people are going to get,"" Arman says.

Still An Economy Of Subsidies

In the poor neighborhoods of south Tehran, the economic struggles are more recognizable. Iran remains an economy of subsidies, although some direct cash payments have been replaced by food baskets for the poor. That does not sit well with those forced to stand in line in the winter cold. Even there, though, flashes of humor can be found.

An old man in a wool cap startles a reporter by shouting: ""We chant 'Death to America' all the time! What are you doing here asking questions?""

But then as the men around him break into grins, he smiles and says, ""Well, I guess you're OK then.""

Mehdi — who also gives only one name — makes it clear that they may need help, but they don't like food lines. They know the difference between a poor neighborhood and a refugee camp.

""This is the fourth time I've come,"" Mehdi, 77, says. ""They tell me to come back later, and then they say they've run out. It's not right.""

Besides a slight easing of sanctions last month, Iran has benefited from the widespread conviction that Rouhani's economic team is far more competent than Ahmadinejad's. Greater confidence — along with limited success in nuclear negotiations with six world powers — has helped reverse Iran's brutal inflation rate, and steadied the Iranian rial somewhat against the dollar.

Doing more, however, will require the lifting of sanctions by further curtailing Iran's nuclear program, and that effort has enemies at home and abroad. Conservative Israeli and U.S. watchdogs such as United Against Nuclear Iran sound regular alarms that ""the architecture of the sanctions regime is crumbling,"" largely based on an increase in trade delegations visiting Iran, and inflated Iranian predictions. President Obama says Washington will come down ""like a ton of bricks"" on those who violate sanctions.

Nothing To Do But Struggle

But inside Iran, people aren't seeing any improvements that would justify such concerns. Even the man in charge of making Iran's oil contracts more attractive to foreign companies is tempering expectations.

Oil ministry official Mehdi Hosseini says Iran needs a massive $150 billion in foreign investment in the coming years, and so far, companies aren't committing.

""We still have sanctions now,"" Hosseini says. ""There are companies coming and going, but we can't sign contracts while the sanctions remain, and contract talks will take time.""

For now, Iranians say, there's nothing to do but struggle on, recognizing that better times ahead depend on factors beyond their control."
Feb 11 2014,"Yellen, Pledging Continuity at Fed, Sees Economy Strengthening",New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/business/yellen-testifies-in-congress-on-economy.html?hp,"WASHINGTON — Janet L. Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, told a House committee on Tuesday that she strongly supported and planned to continue the policies adopted under her predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke.

At the same time, in emphasizing her concern about unemployment — and in agreeing to spend almost six hours answering the committee’s questions — Ms. Yellen also began the delicate process of imposing her own influence on the Fed’s direction.

Ms. Yellen made clear that the Fed planned to keep cutting back on its bond buying, which had been a crucial part of its economic stimulus campaign, unless there was a “notable change” in the economy toward a more negative outlook. “I served on the committee as we formulated our current policy strategy, and I strongly support that strategy,” she said.

But she described the recovery of the labor market as “far from complete,” and said she retained her longstanding conviction that the Fed had the power to improve the situation. That suggests the Fed may continue to strengthen the mainstay of its campaign, keeping short-term interest rates at extraordinarily low levels."
Mar 16 2022,Before the Next Shock: How America Can Build a More Adaptive Global Economy,Foreign Affairs,center,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2022-02-22/next-shock,"During the coming decade, the world economy will confront a crisis. This forecast may sound rash, but the past half century revealed that disasters occur regularly. In recent times, policymakers have faced not just the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic trauma but also various eurozone crises. These dramas followed the global financial crisis of 2008 and the consequent recession, which were in turn preceded by the shock of 9/11. Before the terrorist attacks of that day, the world had coped with the Internet boom and bust at the turn of the millennium; the exchange-rate and debt travails of Russia, East Asia, and Latin America in the late 1990s; painful economic adjustments at the end of the Cold War; developing-country defaults in the 1980s following the petrodollar lending splurge of the 1970s; and stagflation. Crises have been the historical norm, not the exception.

The next exigency could stem from many sources. Financial markets may stumble during the transition from an era of government spending and debt, backed by a flood of monetary liquidity, to a period of less fiscal largess and higher interest rates. Interactions among wildlife, livestock, other domestic animals, and humans will probably result in the spread of more zoonotic viruses. Someday, a cyberattack will shut down critical infrastructure. Disruptive technologies are vying to transform traditional business models through new platforms and decentralized systems. The world is in the early stages of a vast and likely discontinuous energy transition that will match the Industrial Revolution in its hard-to-anticipate effects. The risk of war looms. Even old-fashioned natural disasters may destabilize societies.

Whatever its origins, the next crisis will strike an economic system already under strain. People around the world are frustrated and restless. Leaders everywhere, attentive to domestic politics, are turning toward national industrial policies and hardening their borders. Geopolitical competition has bred mistrust among major economies, and the world seems to be fragmenting into regions pulled by economic gravity toward local poles of power.

The legacy institutions of earlier economic orders are struggling to adjust to these changes. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have to add climate and pandemic policies to their development missions. The World Trade Organization has been unable to modernize its rules through negotiations, and the United States has paralyzed the WTO dispute-settlement system by blocking appointees to appeals panels.

Whatever its origins, the next crisis will strike an economic system already under strain.

Today’s fashion demands junking the old. It yearns for big, bold change. In the United States, the Biden administration decided the moment was ripe for a new New Deal. Internationally, the cognoscenti deposed the old “Washington consensus” in favor of a new geoeconomics. Planners at the United Nations, the RAND Corporation, and the World Economic Forum have heralded new economic orders.

But would-be architects of fresh designs have a mistaken understanding of both economic behavior and effective policymaking. Economic systems develop through constant change, often precipitated by unpredictable and sporadic events. They are more likely to resemble evolutionary and ever-mutating processes than planned orders guided by governments. Policymakers should therefore adapt continually adjusting systems to new circumstances instead of inventing novel structures designed to suit the latest theories.

The economic diplomacy of the 2020s should aim to achieve resilience and foster adaptation. These concepts diverge from the geopolitical ideal of stability and balance, as well as from the hopeful vision of refashioning the world in an ideal image. Economic diplomacy should accept the reality of perpetual dynamism, which differs from the expectation of perpetual conflict and the dream of perpetual peace.

U.S. economic statecraft needs to guide the principal multilateral economic institutions—the IMF, the World Bank, and the WTO—to adapt to a diverse mix of actors, states, and international challenges. The multilateral method of the 2020s must operate across a variety of public and private networks: regional, subnational, national, transnational, and global. Ironically, even though the United States led the creation of the major international organizations, Washington rarely reflects on their practical uses and devotes little effort to their renewal. They have persevered through past disasters, adjusting their mandates to help manage whatever crises have arisen. They have fostered prosperity for decades, and if properly revived, they can continue to do so for decades to come.

EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

In the late 1800s and early 1900s, political economists such as Thorstein Veblen and Joseph Schumpeter argued that economic behavior reflects complex motivations, emotions, events, cultures, histories, and technological changes. They believed that an evolutionary worldview based on biological science would help people better understand the resulting economic activity, including periodic shocks, crises, and revolutions in entrepreneurship. Schumpeter argued that the process led to “creative destruction,” in which new economic innovations and organizations replace older, outdated ones.

Instead, academic economists turned to mathematical models to translate behavior into systems of equations that produce equilibriums. Shocks—such as those that led to the Great Depression—might occur, but economists focused on intervening to restore stability. Proponents of “rational expectations” and “efficient markets” took the idea of rational equilibriums to its logical conclusion, arguing that although individuals might act irrationally, the market, in aggregate, would behave as if everyone were rational. Socialists, in turn, tried instead to direct markets through government planning and state ownership.

Yet during the 1970s, even as theories of rational and efficient markets were winning adherents, Charles Kindleberger, an economic historian, offered a counterpoint. Kindleberger contended that irrational behavior was an important feature of economic systems and that crises occurred with “biologic regularity.” He complemented this insight with the study of international interdependence and institutional behavior, drawing on his practical experience working on the Marshall Plan. That combination led Kindleberger to argue that the world needed systemic leadership that would press for cooperative solutions to achieve global public goods, especially during crises. The task of the leading economic power, according to Kindleberger, was to create and adapt to changing circumstances international regimes that would encourage and execute such adjustments. He synthesized an evolutionary economic outlook with ideas about how governments could act in concert to counter cross-border economic collapses. One of Kindleberger’s students, Robert Shiller, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics and the author of Irrational Exuberance, has researched behavioral economics, a psychological branch of biological thinking. Indeed, Shiller’s recent work draws from epidemiology to study the contagion effects of economic events—a fitting complement to thinking about pandemics.

The application of evolutionary economics should not be an excuse for policy complacency. Nor should it suggest a revival of social Darwinism. To the contrary, policymakers need to adapt systems and institutions to changes and disruptions. But rather than replace the paradigms of the prior order, they must make continual functional fixes that help both national and transnational actors handle shocks and adjust.

MISREADING HISTORY

The penchant for devising new international economic orders traces to Bretton Woods folklore. According to the appealing tale, a farsighted band of Americans, with some input from poorer but learned Britons, recognized the failures of the international economic system after World War I, in particular the Great Depression. In 1944, even as World War II still raged, the Bretton Woods visionaries laid the institutional foundations for a new international economic architecture. They established the IMF and the World Bank (officially, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) to manage exchange rates, support payment and capital flows, finance reconstruction, and encourage investment for development. They drew up plans for an international trade organization to facilitate commerce, but the negotiations collapsed over differences concerning the scope of regulations and controls.

The economic statesmen involved deserve respect. In facing vexing problems, they tried to learn from past mistakes. They sought to build the institutional pillars for a prosperous, peaceful international economy. They wanted to avoid the divisive and ultimately destructive policies of blocs and autarky.

Nevertheless—as the economist Benn Steil, a skillful historian of Bretton Woods, has pointed out—the architects of the conference drafted plans based on faulty assumptions. They supposed that the United States and the Soviet Union would cooperate, that Germany would be “pastoralized” after its economic dismantlement, that the British Empire would safely recede, and that the IMF’s modest balance-of-payments assistance would rebuild global trade. By 1947, each of those assumptions had proved incorrect. As a result, Europe faced economic and political collapse, and the world economy remained moribund.

Within a few years of the conference, another group of economic leaders, led by U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall and U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Clayton, had to devise a new approach. They produced the Marshall Plan, encouraged the integration of Western European economies (including a new Federal Republic of Germany), and negotiated the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to lower tariffs and foster common rules. The Marshall Plan enabled the Western European countries to rebuild their economies in cooperation with one another. The reduction in trade barriers led to global opportunities for growth and export-led development.

BENDING, NOT BREAKING

Yet the post–World War II economic system had to keep changing. The fixed exchange rates of Bretton Woods lasted until 1971, when the United States eliminated the dollar-gold link. For a few years, the major economies tried to reestablish fixed exchange rates at different levels. But the search for a structured order of currencies gave way to another system, this time of flexible, floating exchange rates.

The transition to floating rates was long and difficult, especially because sharp changes in monetary and energy policies triggered vast shifts of capital. France and Germany, for different reasons, eventually decided to return to fixed exchange rates and then, later, to devise a shared currency as part of their drive to unite Europe. Many emerging markets suffered exchange-rate and debt crises. Some developing countries wanted to avoid currency and price volatility, so they built up big dollar reserves and resorted to “dirty floats,” allowing their currencies to fluctuate, but only within a certain range. But overall, flexible exchange rates freed governments to determine national macroeconomic policies without the fixed constraint of protecting the value of their currencies; they relied instead on markets to adjust each currency’s relative price.

To avoid political pressures for trade protection, the United States decided in the second half of the 1980s to foster cooperation among the finance ministers and central bankers of the G-7 countries to manage imbalances in trade flows and between exchange rates. As developing economies became more important and the G-7 lost influence, the G-20 became a more useful forum. For example, the 2009 G-20 summit, in London, organized a timely fiscal and financial regulatory response to the global financial crisis. Now, the influence of the G-20 has faded because of its size, differences among the parties, and bureaucratization.

The world’s legacy institutions have not been the principal problem.

The IMF and the World Bank adapted to meet changed circumstances, as well. The IMF focused on macroeconomic reforms—fiscal and monetary policies—and became the financial firefighter for economies facing balance-of-payments and debt crises. It branched out into structural economic reforms, especially for states in transition to market economies. The IMF also served as an expert partner for the G-7 and, later, the G-20 in their efforts to cooperate. Eventually, the IMF assumed the role—along with the Financial Stability Board, which was formed in 2009—of monitoring and advising on the strength of financial institutions.

The World Bank, in turn, adjusted to changes in development experience and thinking. At first, it largely existed to provide capital for reconstruction in the postwar period in Europe and Japan, as well as for infrastructure in developing countries. But over time, it shifted to helping fund antipoverty programs, advising on structural reforms, offering crisis support and debt restructuring, promoting private-sector development, providing public goods, assisting fragile and insecure states, supporting the United Nations’ Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals, and sharing experience with middle-income economies. The World Bank then even shifted back to infrastructure development through new financing vehicles.

The GATT grew from 23 members to 164. The participants negotiated eight trade rounds, cutting tariffs, expanding the topics covered, and adding rules. The Uruguay Round, completed in 1994, transformed the GATT into the WTO, which established a disciplined dispute-settlement system and, supposedly, an ongoing agenda of negotiations. The WTO offers the principal example of a multilateral body that has agreed-on rules, backed by a process to settle disputes. The system preserves members’ sovereign rights to reject WTO decisions while authorizing counterparties to negotiate compensation or withdraw comparable trade benefits. The rules, backed by a neutral tribunal, have encouraged economies to lower barriers to trade.

Over the course of the 78 years since the creation of the Bretton Woods institutions, would-be architects have regularly proffered new international economic orders. Practical realities, however, have resulted in experiences that look more like those of the leaders of 1947—who recognized that the Bretton Woods system was not working as hoped. As the global economic system evolved, including through shocks and crises, policymakers experimented. Rather than search for a new constructed stability, pragmatic officials accepted that they had to continually navigate through dynamic conditions. The legacy institutions have not been the principal problem; people can adapt them to new needs. The system ossifies when leaders fail to adjust to the next phase of uncertainty.

AMERICAN INNOVATION

The most successful U.S. leaders anticipated—or at least recognized—shifting challenges. They adapted existing networks and institutions, or supplemented them with new ones, to solve novel problems. Leadership, they discovered, often required a mix of using old systems in new ways and devising innovative functional fixes. Schumpeter might have called it “the creative destruction of multilateralism.”

Policymakers today can mine the U.S. experience for lessons about how to build and maintain successful adaptive systems. The first, and most important, lesson is that systems need the flexibility to adjust to changes in technology, finance, and business models. Private sectors are continually innovating. Entrepreneurs’ experiments spark transformations. But disruptions also create costly adjustments.

Ironically, many U.S. foreign policy leaders have overlooked the United States’ innovative strengths. In the 1970s, President Richard Nixon and his adviser Henry Kissinger mapped out a new multilateralism to help manage what they perceived as the United States’ economic decline. Nixon designed his dramatic economic moves of August 1971, when he abandoned the dollar-gold link, to rebalance international economic responsibilities, just as the Nixon Doctrine called for sharing the burdens of security more equally. But in the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz had a more optimistic outlook about the U.S. economy’s ability to renew itself. Accordingly, in the aftermath of Nixon’s break with the fixed exchange rate tied to gold, Shultz favored flexible exchange rates instead of resetting currency prices at new levels. He believed markets had to be free to adjust.

Adaptive systems also recognize power shifts, whether driven by economics, technologies, demographics, or military strength. After World War II, the United States promoted recoveries in Europe and Japan. During the 1970s and 1980s, U.S. policy had to adapt to the larger size and influence of both. In the 1980s and 1990s, the United States began to recognize the continental opportunities—and risks—of changes in Mexico. Working with Canada, Washington created a new North American partnership, with the North American Free Trade Agreement as the cornerstone.

In recent decades, the United States has had to adapt to the growing influence—and problems—of emerging markets. China’s rising power has become Washington’s greatest external preoccupation, although the United States has yet to develop a clear concept of a system that can peacefully accommodate both countries. Americans recognize that India will be a place of power in the years ahead, but they have been slow to appreciate the changing economic patterns across Southeast Asia. The demographics of Africa loom over the future.

The final lesson from the U.S. experience is that successful adaptive systems have to be grounded in political support at home. From 1947 until today, presidents have kept a close eye on public support and built partnerships with Congress as they have developed foreign policies. Polls suggest that Americans recognize the value of global interconnections, but public backing for international commitments ebbs and flows. Dramatic events can seize voters’ attention, but their focus eventually turns to other issues. Successful political leadership has helped citizens perceive that domestic and international interests are different sides of the same coin. The U.S. government needs to help its citizens adapt to change without stifling innovation.

ANTICIPATION AND ADAPTATION

Policymakers find it hard to predict events, but they can and should anticipate developments. They should consider a number of evolving features of today’s global economy. First, the world is in the midst of a historic fiscal-monetary experiment. Since the global financial crisis, major central banks have vastly expanded money and credit. In response to the pandemic, major economies, especially in the developed world, have spent trillions of dollars while relying on monetary policies to buy even more government securities. Even without hazarding judgments about future inflation, pockets of excess, balance-sheet and macroeconomic risks, and the standing of the U.S. dollar, policymakers need to prepare for large, sharp shifts in expectations about economic conditions, in the valuations of assets, and in financial flows across countries and markets.

The finance ministers and central bankers of major economies need a small, informal forum where they can regularly monitor macroeconomic and financial conditions, share perspectives, and, when necessary, act in concert. To avoid jousts over leadership, the IMF could organize quarterly sessions among the principal actors in the global financial system, those whose currencies are in the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset created by the IMF: China, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the eurozone countries (and the European Central Bank). When the next crisis hits, these economies will need to cooperate.

The IMF, as host and neutral ground, should offer independent outlooks. The managing director of the IMF could serve as an economic diplomat, quietly suggesting cooperative steps. The G-7, the G-20, and the wider IMF membership would continue their work, contributing to and expanding the reach of the core SDR group.

Such a forum might also build habits of cooperation and a sense of shared responsibility. That ethos could help these actors devise approaches to problems such as developing countries’ debts. Many poorer economies now rely on Beijing as their lender of first resort, but China’s lack of debt transparency inhibits improvements for all parties, including China itself. As the reserve-currency countries experiment with digital currencies and payment systems, the group could also consider questions of interoperability, confidence, and security. Although political constraints may limit or preclude cooperation, this forum could at least identify options for constructive action.

Many poorer economies rely on Beijing for loans.

Economic stability isn’t threatened just by fiscal policy and markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, external, noneconomic forces, such as diseases, can quickly create global economic crises, and the world is still learning how to prevent, recognize, and respond to dangerous viruses and other risks to biological security. The frequency and costs of viral disease outbreaks have been increasing as interactions among wildlife, livestock, other domestic animals, and people have expanded rapidly. Transportation networks accelerate global transmission. South Asia, Southeast Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa are especially intense hot spots. The slow pace of vaccination in developing countries creates opportunities for more variants, which might then roll across the world in ruinous waves. The economic effects of disease have hit the poorest people the hardest.

The UN agencies charged with strengthening the provision of global public goods—such as the World Health Organization (WHO)—do not have the resources or the authority to match their mandates. The nation-states that compose their governing boards make (or veto) the real decisions. Each body has its own peculiar political culture. The multilateral economic institutions should add their expertise, resources, and convening power to assist these agencies. Even though most of the same governments participate in the United Nations and the multilateral economic organizations, each body draws from different ministries, power centers, and advocates.

For example, as the finance ministries of the world struggled with the global financial crisis in 2008, food prices surged in developing countries. The World Bank customized support for the UN humanitarian agencies that handle food and agriculture and worked with the WTO and the G-20 to resist export bans and boost transparency in order to avoid panic and hoarding. When the economist Chad Bown reviewed the transparency initiative over a decade later, he concluded that the better information networks were still helping counter price spikes and export controls that could exacerbate food price problems.

COVID-19 has demonstrated that the WHO does not have the field capacity to counter a global pandemic. In the first decade of this century, the organization supported the creation of GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance—a public-private partnership with the Gates Foundation, UNICEF, pharmaceutical companies, and the World Bank that helps develop vaccines in poor countries. COVAX, GAVI’s initiative to fight COVID-19, has stumbled, but so have many national projects. The UN Economic Commission for Africa and the African Export-Import Bank adapted rapidly to coordinate vaccine providers, encourage African production of vaccines, build on national delivery systems, and find fast finance.

A new pandemic is just one way that nature could spark an economic shock.

A new international biological security agreement could enhance this institutional and financial cooperation. Both health and veterinary authorities need to gather and share better and more timely information about zoonotic viruses. Research funding could enable health authorities to map the DNA sequences of potentially dangerous diseases. The World Bank and the U.S. Agency for International Development should work with the WHO to ensure strong connections all along the vaccine delivery chain, especially through the health-care systems of poor countries. The U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, which the United States devised to suppress the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa almost 20 years ago, offers an obvious but inexplicably untapped model.

But a disease outbreak is just one way that nature could help spark an economic shock. Climate change is prompting new environmental and carbon policies that will change energy markets and costs during a lengthy era of transition away from fossil fuels. Huge structural shifts in energy sources, production, transmission, and pricing will create disconnects. Some major developing economies, already struggling with COVID-19, will object adamantly to paying for the transition. The world economy will face sizable adaptation costs, as well.

The World Bank raised money for the new Climate Investment Funds in 2008. The CIF experimented with climate initiatives for developing countries in technologies, resilience, energy access, and forestation. The original $8.5 billion leveraged total investments of roughly $70 billion. As a practical matter, developed-country donors were willing to entrust the World Bank and its regional counterparts with innovative trust funds (and evaluation processes), but they were not ready to just write checks to developing countries.

The UN pressed for its own funding arm, leading to the creation of the Green Climate Fund. Over the course of a decade, the GCF has struggled to gain scale and confidence. Meanwhile, the World Bank’s CIF has been sidelined. Developing countries are complaining that higher-income states are not fulfilling their pledges to help fund the transition to low- or no-carbon energy. The United States and its partners need practical adaptations to overcome this impasse; they should be building on a successful record.

The new International Sustainability Standards Board, created by the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation, can help. It will draft climate disclosure criteria that should offer investors in 130 countries reliable, comparative environmental data. Investors, customers, and regulators are pressing companies to detail carbon net-zero commitments and energy transition plans. Almost 100 financial supervisors and the IMF are incorporating climate risks in their financial assessments of banks, other lenders, and countries. Taken together, these developments are creating the data infrastructure needed for carbon credit markets. The World Bank should connect development projects to institutional investors through new, large, liquid carbon finance markets, where carbon financial products will be tracked and traded like other commodities.

Energy markets are not the only sector that could disrupt the global economy or that would benefit from new monitoring and oversight. In the coming years, digital and data transfers will increasingly underpin the world economy. Even before the pandemic, growth in the trade of manufactured goods had slowed notably, but trade in services had jumped. Digital connectivity is enabling even more wide-ranging and numerous gains in services, and the pandemic economy has accelerated this trend. But the rules and standards for exchanges of data and digital products are ill defined. Conflicts will become more common. Cyberattacks will shut down vital information systems.

The United States has traditionally led in encouraging new international rules and standards, in part because U.S. firms have been in the forefront of cutting-edge activities. But today, economic and technological processes race ahead with little multilateral guidance. Washington should be preparing new rules for the digital trade, working first with like-minded partners. The rules should ease the transfer of digital services and data across borders, while giving countries the freedom to judge their own needs for security, safety, and privacy.

But implementing these new, U.S.-made rules across the world will prove tricky. The United States is continuously clashing with the planet’s second-largest economy: China. Both have been undermining the international economic system that enabled the former’s unparalleled power and the latter’s historic rise. Both have shown little inclination to sponsor systemic reforms.

The global economy is unlikely to evolve soundly if the U.S. and China are in conflict.

Washington will need to decide whether it can conceive of working practically with Beijing on topics of mutual interest. At times, U.S. policy now attempts to limit, contain, decouple the U.S. economy from, or penalize China’s economy. On other occasions, Washington demands that China purchase more U.S. exports and treat U.S. companies better—steps that would further integration. Sometimes, the United States wants China to adhere to rules, whether international or Washington’s, but other times, the United States acts as if China is too big, bullying, or untrustworthy to function reliably within a system of rules at all. U.S. policies also have to account for the preferences of U.S. allies and partners, who cannot envisage containment of, or a full decoupling from, China.

When Kindleberger analyzed the causes of the Great Depression, he pointed to the absence of a leading country that would act on the basis of systemic as well as national interests. In the 1930s, the United Kingdom had the experience but no longer the capacity to lead; the United States had the potential but not the disposition or experience. Kindleberger also warned that an abdication of or conflict over leadership would lead to stalemate and economic hardship. He would have eyed today’s U.S.-Chinese tensions with worry.

The United States will probably find its way toward a mixed approach with China: some combination of exclusion, participation, and perhaps even cooperation. In doing so, the United States will need to decide whether, as a general matter, it prefers to explore adaptive methods with China or to resist Chinese participation. The world economy is unlikely to evolve soundly and resiliently if the two biggest economies are in conflict.

The plight of the WTO typifies the challenge of adapting multilateral institutions to changing circumstances in an era when national governments find political posturing more tempting than negotiating useful, albeit imperfect, cooperative regimes. Globalization’s opponents have objected to the WTO’s rules even as they have demanded new international rules for their favored causes. Others have insisted that WTO rules should account for their preferences—with or without a negotiating process. Even though the United States has won the vast majority of the WTO cases it has brought—and used the leverage of litigation to gain results in other situations—some U.S. interests have objected to losing any cases at all. The U.S. government has blamed the WTO’s Appellate Body for adverse rulings and paralyzed the system by blocking appointments. So far, the Biden administration has joined the chorus complaining about the WTO instead of working to improve the organization.

AVOIDING EXTINCTION

The forces of globalization have not retreated. Consider the challenges of climate change, biological security, migration, and financial and data flows. But the governance of globalization has been fraying and fragmenting, and people across the world appear disconnected. These conditions explain the appeal of creating new, sweeping economic systems. But they won’t work.

Since the Great Depression, U.S. economic diplomacy has been most successful when officials have combined a sense of direction about an open, cooperative, mutually beneficial international economic system with a spirit of problem solving. Americans have adapted to a variety of forces and events through pragmatic adjustments. They have recognized implicitly that the world economy operates more like an evolutionary organism than a rational model, whether purely capitalist or socialist. The goal has been to foster economic resilience.

Resilient systems do not avoid risks; indeed, risk-taking produces economic progress. The principal aim of a resilient, adaptive system is to prevent tipping points or downward spirals that could lead to its extinction. Multilateral economic institutions and regimes can help national governments and private participants withstand blows and adapt. They can forecast developments, encourage cooperation, provide buffers, recommend redundancies, mobilize resources, offer expertise and continuous learning, encourage negotiations, and help manage conflicts. But they adapt incrementally and need the support of their member governments. Multilateral institutions should now extend their economic and development missions to encompass transnational challenges in partnership with specialized UN agencies for health, the environment, migration and refugees, and food and agriculture. They also can contribute to the economic, governance, and legal foundations for security in states and regions torn by conflict.

The world economy operates more like an evolutionary organism than a rational model.

As the economist Markus Brunnermeier has observed, resilient and adaptive economic systems are natural complements to free and open societies. Such systems flourish with transparency, open information, and solutions achieved through the combined efforts of many private and independent actors. Free-flowing information creates feedback loops that speed adjustment. Authoritarian countries, by contrast, deal with crises by seeking to suppress disruptions. They opt for controls, as Beijing has done with COVID-19. Open societies and economic systems appear shaky when shocked but are more likely to rebound through adaptations. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union developed world-class vaccines and treatments; they are likely to weather future pandemic waves through a combination of high-quality vaccines, natural immunity, and treatments. China will have to choose between strict controls and adapting to virus waves that must pass through its population. An overreliance on suppression will lead to China’s isolation.

The United States has been most successful when it has mobilized international coalitions that enabled other participants to pursue both national and systemic interests with Washington. The country will not become safer by retreating behind walls and borders, nor will it succeed by tearing down the existing order and pursuing chimeras. Washington needs to rediscover its ability to adapt pragmatically to dynamic conditions. As Helmut Schmidt, the West German chancellor, said in the late 1970s, “Those who have visions should see a doctor.”"

Obama will use the bully pulpit to sell his vision directly to Americans

White House adviser%3A Obama believes Washington %27has taken its eye off the ball%27

WASHINGTON — President Obama will kick off a several-weeks long effort Wednesday to barnstorm the country and press resistant Republicans to work with him to bolster the economy.

In the campaign, Obama will lay out his vision directly to Americans for how Washington and the private sector can put a charge into an economy that is improving only in fits and starts. He is turning to a tool — the bully pulpit — that has largely failed him on issues such as gun control and budget cuts.

This latest push will start with a major address at Knox College in western Illinois on Wednesday.

White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said in an e-mail that Obama believes Washington ""has taken its eye off the ball on the most important issue facing the country."" Among the specific topics related to the economy that Obama will address in the coming weeks are job security, education and health care.

""Instead of talking about how to help the middle class, too many in Congress are trying to score political points, refight old battles and trump up phony scandals,"" Pfeiffer said. ""And in a couple of months, we will face some more critical budget deadlines that require congressional action, not showdowns that only serve to harm families and businesses — and the president wants to talk about the issues that should be at the core of that debate.""

""We welcome the president's focus on the economy, but given that so many are still struggling after nearly five years, it's clear his agenda of higher taxes and higher spending isn't the answer,"" said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner.

Obama chose the small town of Galesburg, where he has a long history dating back to his early moments on the national political scene, to start the push.

Former representative Lane Evans brought Obama to the community in 2003 to endorse him when the future president was a state senator and underdog candidate for the U.S. Senate. Since then, the small rural community has remained a personal touchstone.

He pointed to Galesburg in his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address — after the community had just lost 1,600 jobs at the Maytag plant to Mexico — as the sort of place that Washington needed to be paying more attention to. He delivered the commencement address at Knox College in 2005, which was his first major economic address and, according to Pfeiffer, ""sowed the seeds"" of Obama's economic vision.

""Our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity. That's what's produced our unrivaled political stability,"" then-Sen. Obama said.

He again noted the struggles of the community in his 2010 State of the Union address, and he made an impromptu stop in Galesburg during a Midwest bus tour in 2011 to tout his vision of the economy.

In addition to his return to Galesburg, Obama will travel to rural Warrensburg, Mo., on Wednesday and Jacksonville on Thursday to deliver remarks.

It remains to be seen to what extent he will underscore his desire to see Congress pass immigration laws in his speeches. The Senate has passed immigration legislation, but the GOP-controlled House has showed reluctance.

The president has resisted wading too deeply into the immigration debate on Capitol Hill — strategy that he hoped would create a ""permission structure"" giving the most conservative lawmakers a chance to support the law without appearing supportive of the president.

But as hopes for the legislation fade, Obama may be cautiously stepping deeper into that debate."
Jul 25 2013,"Obama Focuses on Economy, Vowing to Help Middle Class",New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/25/us/politics/obama-to-restate-economic-vision-at-knox-college.html?ref=politics,"WARRENSBURG, Mo. — President Obama tried to move past months of debate over guns, surveillance and scandal on Wednesday and reorient his administration behind a program to lift a middling economy and help middle-class Americans who are stuck with stagnant incomes and shrinking horizons.

In speeches in two small college towns in the Midwest, Mr. Obama lamented that typical Americans had been left behind by globalization, Wall Street irresponsibility and Washington policies, while the richest Americans had accumulated more wealth. He declared it “my highest priority” to reverse those trends, while accusing other politicians of not only ignoring the problem but also making it worse.

“With this endless parade of distractions and political posturing and phony scandals, Washington’s taken its eye off the ball,” Mr. Obama told an audience at Knox College, in Galesburg, Ill., the site of his first major economic speech as a young senator eight years ago. “And I am here to say this needs to stop. This needs to stop. This moment does not require short-term thinking. It does not require having the same old stale debates. Our focus has to be on the basic economic issues that matter most to you — the people we represent.”

The hourlong speech in Galesburg, his first speech of the day and one of the longest of his presidency, at times resembled a State of the Union address. The president mainly offered revived elements of his largely stalled economic program, like developing new energy, rebuilding manufacturing, spending more on roads, bridges and ports, expanding preschool to every 4-year-old in the country and raising the minimum wage."

Dec 04 2013,Even Democrats realize Obama won't fix economy,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/3/lambro-depression-rule-rather-exception/,"OPINION:

As President Obama approaches the end of his fifth year in office, he’s nearing the time for his annual report card. It isn’t a pretty picture.

Americans are giving him failing grades, as polls show his job-approval scores plunging to the lowest level in his presidency. Only 41 percent approve of his performance in office, while 52 percent now disapprove of the overall job he’s been doing.

There are plenty of reasons for Mr. Obama’s dismal marks — from his foreign-policy blunders and a troubling decline in our national security defenses to a still-high unemployment economy that remains subpar and sluggish. Throw in the Obamacare debacle that’s become a disastrous metaphor for his administration’s incompetence.

However, these and other failures aren’t being pointed out just by his Republican opponents, but by Democrats, too, who are deeply troubled by what they see on a range of issues.

New York Times economics columnist Paul Krugman, one of Mr. Obama’s earliest supporters, recently raised the prospect of a painfully weak, job-starved economy lasting a great deal longer than most economists expected.

“What if depression-like conditions are on track to persist, not for another year or two, but for decades?” the Nobel Prize-winning economist wrote late last month in his widely syndicated newspaper column.

Mr. Krugman’s answer is that “economic reality is what it is. And what that reality appears to be right now is one in which depression rules will apply for a very long time.”

Mr. Krugman is not alone in his dire depiction of the Obama economy. Other Democrats were saying the same thing, including Lawrence Summers, the former chairman of Mr. Obama’s White House National Economic Council, and secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton.

In a recent, high-profile lecture before the International Monetary Fund’s annual research conference, Mr. Summers said for the first time that we could be in for a long period of “chronic and systemic economic sluggishness.”

In other words, this economy isn’t going to get much better. We’re going to slog through a painful, jobless period for the rest of Mr. Obama’s presidency.

More recently, the House and Senate leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, said that America now faces a growing terrorist threat.

Mr. Obama won re-election by telling voters that al Qaeda’s terrorist ranks were “decimated,” we had them “on the run,” and that we were much safer as a result. But Mrs. Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers, Michigan Republican, who are briefed regularly in secret by the government’s top security officials, are telling us a far different and more alarming story.

“The terrorism threat against the United States is increasing, and Americans are not as safe as they were a year or two ago,” the two chairmen said in a joint interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” Sunday, according to The Washington Post.

Mrs. Feinstein told CNN that now “there are more terrorist groups than ever, with more sophisticated and hard-to-detect bombs,” the Post reported. “There is a huge malevolence out there,” she said.

Does that sound like we’re safer? Yet, perhaps no other shortcoming in this administration has been as shocking as the multiple failures of Obamacare.

The White House is telling us this week that the botched computer system is improved, but Mr. Obama also told us we could keep our existing insurance policies — a preposterous claim that turned out to be false.

As of Tuesday, the system was still producing a lot of error-ridden applications — up to one-third of them had mistakes — meaning, that many people may not have the coverage that they expect next month.

While the focus has been on fixing the online apparatus, the deeper problems embedded in his health care law are even more ominous. We’re going to see many more layoffs and much more part-time hiring by businesses to stay under the 50-employee threshold for mandated health care coverage. We’re already seeing sharply higher premiums owing to the mandated benefits many older Americans do not need or want.

Our government has become a mess of unworkable, wasteful, duplicative, archaic, unaffordable programs and agencies. However, Mr. Obama has been working to expand the size and cost of government, not reduce it. Obamacare is his latest, costly nationwide experiment.

Mr. Krugman’s column also raised this disturbing question: “But what if the world we’ve been living in for the past five years is the new normal?” A number of economists now believe this to be the case, until we put someone else in charge who understands how capitalism can restore American prosperity once again.

The U.S. economy has been growing for four straight years — each under the leadership of President Obama.

But the pace of improvement has been disappointing to many, especially the nearly 12 million people still looking for work.

Americans are divided about how to view the White House's economic record. A McClatchy-Marist poll released this week shows 54 percent of Americans think the country is still in an economic downturn. But that dreary assessment is actually a big improvement considering that as recently as March, 63 percent thought the country was in a recession.

Now Obama is launching an effort to renew focus on job creation for the middle class. The White House says he will make about a half-dozen speeches around the country, with the first Wednesday afternoon at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.

That's where he made a pivotal speech on the economy in 2005 — his first year as a U.S. senator. And on Monday, Obama told supporters that upon this return to Knox, he will deliver ""a pretty good speech.""

So as the White House gets ready for this new campaign to begin, let's take stock of five key indicators of economic health:

Jobs: Most economists say that nothing matters more than job growth. More jobs can quickly translate into more people buying cars, moving into new homes, taking vacations and otherwise stimulating growth.

But job creation has been slow throughout the recovery, with the unemployment rate staying stuck at 7.6 percent. This spring, the hiring pace picked up, to around 200,000 new jobs per month. In more normal times, that rate would give a president bragging rights, but at a time when 11.8 million remain out of work and another 8.3 million are stuck in part-time jobs, the economy is not adding enough paychecks.

Housing: After a tough — no, make that hideous — run of foreclosures and price plunges, the housing market finally is improving. The sector peaked in 2006, and then went into a nose dive that pushed prices down by roughly a third.

But the widely followed S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show average home prices have popped back up by roughly 12 percent over the past year. And mortgage defaults have been easing. So the market appears to be healing, though many homeowners are still a long way from seeing their real estate values return to 2006 levels.

Debt/deficit: The long-term national debt hovers at $16.75 trillion, roughly the same size as the entire U.S. economy. But thanks to this year's federal spending cuts and tax hikes, the annual budget deficit is shrinking fast.

The Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal 2013 deficit probably will decline to just 4 percent of GDP, down dramatically from 7 percent in 2012. By 2015, the deficit should be down to about 2 percent of GDP — a level that most economists would say is quite manageable. In light of such improvement, Moody's this month upgraded the U.S. credit rating outlook from negative to stable.

Interest rates: Whether they're buying a car or a home, most Americans are very concerned about interest rates. Over the past three months, mortgage rates have been heading higher, up from roughly 3.5 percent in early May to about 4.5 percent now for a 30-year-fixed mortgage. That remains a very low level by historical standards, and the upward trend has petered out, at least for now.

Economists generally say rates are still low enough to make cars and homes affordable for people with jobs. And for businesses, the prime lending rate is holding steady at 3.25 percent — a rate that makes it easy to borrow money for expansion.

Consumer sentiment: In general, consumer confidence has been rising over the past year, thanks to gains in jobs, stock prices and home values. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed the highest reading in May and June of any time since before the recession began in late 2007.

But a preliminary reading of the index for July suggests some of the spring's optimism has started to melt this summer as mortgage rates have ticked up. Sentiment also has declined as more workers have felt the effects of government spending cuts. In June, retail sales grew just 0.4 percent, a disappointing rate."
Jan 12 2023,Analysts: Don't think of Fed rate hike slow downs as cuts; high rates can still affect economy,ABC 10News San Diego,not-yet-rated,https://10news.com/news/national/analysts-dont-think-of-fed-rate-hike-slow-downs-as-cuts-high-rates-can-still-affect-economy,"The nation's painfully high inflation has been at the center of Wall Street's wild movements for more than a year. Recently, stocks have been rising and bond yields have been falling on hopes inflation's cooldown from a summertime peak may get the Federal Reserve to ease off its barrage of rate hikes. Such increases can stifle inflation, but they do so by slowing the economy and risk causing a recession. They also hurt investment prices.

Many traders are betting on the Fed to follow that with perhaps another quarter-point hike, but to then potentially take a pause, according to data from CME Group.

Analysts cautioned that while Thursday's inflation report did show inflation at its least debilitating level in more than a year, it still leaves room for continued pressure on the economy from high rates. They warned more big swings may still be to come for markets.

""While we can safely say that we are past peak inflation, it is too early to call victory on the battle against higher inflation,"" said Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares Investment Strategy, Americas.

Analysts also warned investors not to think of slower rate hikes or a coming halt to increases as the same thing as cuts to interest rates, something some investors hope may happen later this year. Such cuts can act like rocket fuel for markets.

Even though inflation slowed to 6.5% last month from its peak of more than 9% in June, it's still far too high for the Fed's and U.S. households' liking. The central bank has been adamant that it plans to continue raising rates this year and that it sees no rate cuts happening until 2024 at the earliest.

Of course, its forecasts have proven to be very wrong in the past, such as when officials called the initial burst of inflation coming out of the pandemic a ""transitory"" problem.

Some areas of the economy remain strong, threatening to keep up the pressure on inflation. Chief among them is the labor market. A report on Thursday showed fewer workers filed for unemployment benefits last week. That's an indication layoffs remain low even though some big tech companies have made high-profile announcements on job cuts.

A strong job market is of course good for workers, particularly when their raises have been failing to keep up with inflation. But the Fed has been saying it does not want wage gains to get too high. That could create a vicious cycle where companies raise prices to cover their higher costs and only worsen inflation.

A report last week showed that workers' wage gains slowed in December. That report, coupled with the latest inflation data ""paints a strong picture that the Fed is starting to meet its target,"" said Peter Essele, head of portfolio management for Commonwealth Financial Network. It also gives Wall Street more hope that the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing,"" where it tames inflation without inflicting severe damage on the economy.

""The likelihood of a soft landing is probably greater now than it was in the past 12 months,"" Essele said.

Wall Street is drifting higher Thursday after a report showed inflation slowed again last month, bolstering hopes the Federal Reserve may take it easier on the economy through smaller hikes to interest rates.

The S&P 500 was 0.5% higher after flipping between small gains and losses through the morning. While the report on U.S. inflation was clearly encouraging, stocks had already rallied earlier this week in anticipation of exactly such data. The numbers were in line with forecasts on many points, and analysts warned investors not to get carried away by them.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 252 points, or 0.7%, at 34,219, as of 2:44 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.6% higher. They also earlier drifted between gains and losses.

Small company stocks were outpacing the broader market. The Russell 2000 rose 1.5%.

In the bond market, Thursday's inflation report sent yields falling further as traders grow more convinced the Fed will downshift the size of its next rate increase. They're now largely forecasting a hike of just 0.25 percentage points next month, down from December's half-point hike and from four prior increases of 0.75 percentage points.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other economy-dictating loans, fell to 3.45% from 3.54% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which tends to more closely track expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.13% from 4.22%.

On Wall Street, stocks of airlines flew to some of the biggest gains after American Airlines said it expects to report stronger revenue and profit than it had earlier forecast for the last three months of 2022. It rose 8.5%, while United Airlines gained 6.7%.

Earnings reporting season is set to kick off in earnest Friday, with JPMorgan Chase and UnitedHealth Group among the day's headliners. One big worry on Wall Street is that high inflation and a slowing global economy are eating into profits for big companies.

Analysts say this could be the first time earnings per share for S&P 500 companies fall from year-ago level since 2020.

Economic activity picked up in the first quarter of this year, with output expanding at an annualized pace of 2.5 percent, according to a Commerce Department report released on Friday. The number was a welcome improvement from the unusually sluggish growth at the end of 2012, but significant government spending cuts and the pinch from recent tax increases look likely to keep the economy in stall speed in the months ahead.

“We just have not been able to hit escape velocity, to get us growing fast enough to make up for the ground we lost during the recession,” said Steve Blitz, director and chief economist at ITG Investment Research. He forecasts growth around 2 to 2.5 percent for the rest of the year, which is slower than the economy’s long-term average. “Government spending is clearly a negative, but the reason why it’s such a strong negative is because there’s nothing else in the private sector really driving things forward.”

Economists noted that even the decent growth in the first quarter was probably somewhat overstated, with some of the improvement caused mostly by a rebound from the bare 0.4 annual growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2012. Businesses drew down their back-room inventories at the end of last year, so they needed to replenish them at the start of 2013. But that stockroom rebalancing appears to have restored inventories to acceptable levels and probably will not drive much more business spending growth later in the year."

Jun 11 2014,Cutting the U.S. Budget Would Help the Economy Grow,The Heritage Foundation,right,http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/11/cutting-the-us-budget-would-help-the-economy-grow,"Austerity is the result of countries’ democratic decisions to wait until the last minute before acting, under the pressure of the markets, mainly by raising taxes rather than implementing long-waited reforms.

—Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, former member of the executive board of the European Central Bank.[1]

Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives have convened the first budget conference in four years. With the deadline of December 13 for the conference report, lawmakers have little time to agree on a budget plan for fiscal year 2014 and beyond, and yet so much depends on their succeeding.

Excessive federal spending and high debt slow economic growth. Despite a broad consensus that the U.S. fiscal path is unsustainable without significant reductions in spending—especially in the growing spending on entitlements—many policymakers are hesitant to embrace large-scale budget cuts for fear of slowing the economy. This fear is misplaced because significant budget cuts today would enable stronger economic growth tomorrow. If lawmakers neglect entitlement reform and further spending reductions, growing spending and high debt will significantly depress U.S. economic growth.

The Budget Situation

Federal spending is taking an increasing share of the productive resources in the economy. At well above one-fifth of gross domestic product (GDP), federal spending is too high, and chronic deficits are quickly driving publicly held debt above three-fourths of GDP.

The federal government has used borrowing to finance much of the spending growth over the past two decades. For the past four years, low tax revenues due to the recession and temporary government spending measures—such as the stimulus, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), and assistance programs—have resulted in consecutive trillion-dollar annual deficits.

Despite expiration of these temporary spending measures, sequestration, and a surge in revenues, annual deficits remain staggeringly high at $700 billion for fiscal year 2013 and will surge beyond $1 trillion before the end of the decade.[2] Growing federal spending, especially on health care and retirement entitlements, will drive deficits and debt to even higher levels after 2023. Tax revenues are quickly growing to beyond their historical average of about 18 percent of GDP. With the $3.2 trillion in tax increases over the decade enacted under President Barack Obama, tax revenues are now growing faster than spending, but not enough to curb the growth in deficits and debt.[3]

Spending will remain well above the historical average of 20.2 percent in the near term and will dramatically surge after the end of the decade as entitlement programs, including the Medicaid expansion and health care subsidies in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), overwhelm the federal budget.

Sequestration

Much of the budget conference debate is focused on undoing sequestration, a 2.5 percent reduction of projected spending over 10 years that went into effect on March 1, 2013. This demonstrates the extent to which policymakers are willing to drag their feet on even moderate spending reductions.

When Congress and the President negotiated over increasing the debt ceiling in the summer of 2011, they agreed to raise the debt limit in three installments for a total increase of $2.1 trillion. To offset this increase, they enacted caps to limit the growth in discretionary spending to save $917 billion over 10 years. To achieve at least $1.2 trillion in additional spending reductions, Congress established a “super committee” to identify specific cuts. Sequestration, an idea originally proposed by the Obama Administration,[4] was intended as a mechanism to force cuts by threatening automatic spending cuts if the super committee failed, which it ultimately did.[5]

These automatic spending reductions demonstrate Washington dysfunction. Rather than deliberately identifying waste and inappropriate federal spending, the President and Congress relinquished their responsibility to govern to a blunt instrument that barely even slows the growth in total federal spending. Even with sequestration, nominal federal spending is projected to grow by 69 percent in 10 years. Lawmakers should deliberately budget within sequestration spending levels and do much more to slow the explosion in spending and debt.

High Stakes

Academic research shows that economic growth slows significantly at high levels of public debt.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates in its alternative fiscal scenario that publicly held debt will rise to 87 percent within the decade, assuming only moderate increases in net interest costs.[6] According to the CBO, “Such a large amount of federal debt will reduce the nation’s output and income below what would occur if the debt was smaller, and it raises the risk of a fiscal crisis (in which the government would lose the ability to borrow money at affordable interest rates).”[7]

Spending on interest on the debt is already the sixth-largest budget item at today’s historically low interest rates, and interest payments are projected to double in only five years. If interest rates rise higher or sooner, U.S. federal debt will reach economically damaging levels even faster.

Academic research by a number of economists finds that countries with high debt levels experience lower economic growth. Carmen M. Reinhart, Vincent R. Reinhart, and Kenneth S. Rogoff found that debt levels between 90 percent and 120 percent of GDP correlate with slower growth of 1.2 percentage points.[8] Similarly, Manmohan S. Kumar and Jaejoon Woo report that advanced economies with high levels of debt grew 1.3 percentage points slower annually than their low-debt (below 30 percent) counterparts. Kumar and Woo additionally emphasize that the negative effects of debt increase as debt grows from 30 percent to 90 percent.[9] Finally, Stephen Cecchetti, Madhusudan Mohanty, and Fabrizio Zampolli identified 84 percent of GDP as the point at which high debt becomes most harmful.[10] The U.S. is on track to exceed this level before the end of the decade.

Slower growth directly affects American families. As Heritage Foundation economist Salim Furth calculated, a decade of debt drag would reduce the income of the typical American family by $11,000.[11] Moreover, lower growth means fewer available jobs and fewer opportunities for Americans to improve their economic circumstances.[12]





Budget Cuts Today, Economic Growth Tomorrow

Lawmakers face a choice of either confronting the nation’s spending crisis head-on by reforming entitlement and other structural spending or continuing to operate with their heads in the sand, waiting for a spending and debt tsunami to wash over the nation and drown economic growth.

Research shows that reductions in government spending free resources in the economy for investment and job creation, thus spurring economic growth. For example, the CBO assessed three different deficit scenarios and their impact on the economy: a $2 trillion increase in primary deficits, a $2 trillion decrease in primary deficits, and a $4 trillion decrease in primary deficits. The CBO’s results show that any short-term boost in gross national product (GNP)[13] from higher deficit spending in the short term would be more than offset by the long-term reduction in economic growth from higher interest rates and a crowding-out effect of private investment. Equally, any short-term dip in GNP from additional deficit reduction would be followed by stronger economic growth over the long term.[14]

Government spending changes the composition of total demand, such as by increasing consumption at the expense of investment. Poorly targeted deficit spending would boost GNP in the short term, but leave less available for productive investments in the future. Deficit spending shifts economic resources from the future to the present, leaving younger generations with a larger tax burden and fewer resources to invest. In reverse, lower government spending frees economic resources for investment in the private sector, which improves consumer wealth. In sum, additional government spending today harms economic growth in the long term, while budget cuts today would enable the economy to grow much faster tomorrow.

The CBO scenario does not specify how deficit reduction would be accomplished—whether through entitlement reforms or by raising taxes. However, the mechanism is important. If the President and Congress raised taxes further, they would reduce the incentives to work, save, and invest, consequently lowering economic growth. Higher taxes would also mean that fewer resources would be available in the economy to build businesses and hire workers. Balancing the budget with a massive tax increase rather than by limiting spending is a recipe for economic stagnation. The long-term health of the economy depends less on a balanced budget than on limiting the size and scope of the government.

An in-depth Heritage Foundation report reveals lessons from Europe’s exercise in austerity. The authors reached the overwhelming conclusion that the method of austerity matters: Increasing taxes was more damaging to the economy and less effective in reducing deficits than spending cuts. Moreover, reducing spending brings the added benefit of stronger economic growth over time.[15]

In a paper that analyzes the effects of fiscal policy on investment in 18 member countries for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Alberto Alesina and other economists found that higher government spending is associated with less business investment. However, when governments cut spending, private investment surges.[16] More recent research by Alesina and others concluded that a mild dip in GDP from spending reductions is a temporary effect that quickly gives way to growth. As Salim Furth summarized the research, “Alesina, Favero, and Giavazzi’s results imply that the void left by decreased government spending is filled within a year by increased investment and consumption, and the economy continues growing.”[17]

Another factor warranting further research consideration is that large deficit spending depresses growth by increasing uncertainty over a country’s future fiscal health. Major U.S. credit rating agencies continue to stress the need for additional deficit reduction over the long term. Moody’s recently emphasized that the U.S. economy “has demonstrated a degree of resilience to major reductions in the growth of government spending.”[18] Lawmakers should feel emboldened to enforce sequestration-level spending and slow the growth in entitlement spending, thereby providing certainty on the U.S. fiscal course.

Much Larger Spending Cuts Needed

Despite the hype about sequestration, federal spending will grow rapidly over the next decade and will accelerate beyond the 10-year budget window. In addition to enforcing sequestration, lawmakers should reform entitlement and other structural spending to rein in spending and debt now and not wait until a debt crisis forces severe austerity measures on Americans.

Putting the budget on a path to balance with spending cuts would spur economic growth by reducing uncertainty and by freeing up resources for investment and job creation. As the European crisis demonstrates, the option to make gradual changes will expire, and Americans and the U.S. economy will suffer a self-inflicted wound from unavoidable austerity measures if lawmakers continue to procrastinate the inevitable.

Dec 02 2022,"U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in November, more than expected despite Fed rate hikes",NBC News (Online),left,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/us-economy-added-263000-jobs-november-expected-fed-rate-hikes-rcna59775,"Job growth was much better than expected in November despite the Federal Reserve’s aggressive efforts to slow the labor market and tackle inflation.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 263,000 for the month while the unemployment rate was 3.7%, the Labor Department reported Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 200,000 on the payrolls number and 3.7% for the jobless rate.

The monthly gain was a slight decrease from October’s upwardly revised 284,000. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons edged lower to 6.7%.

The numbers likely will do little to slow a Fed that has been raising interest rates steadily this year to bring down inflation still running near its highest level in more than 40 years. The rate increases have brought the Fed’s benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a target range of 3.75% to 4%.

In another blow to the Fed’s anti-inflation efforts, average hourly earnings jumped 0.6% for the month, double the Dow Jones estimate. Wages were up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis, also well above the 4.6% expectation.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 200 points after the report as the hot jobs data could make the Fed even more aggressive. Treasury yields jumped after the news, with the two-year note, the most sensitive to monetary policy, up more than 10 basis points to about 4.36%.

“To have 263,000 jobs added even after policy rates have been raised by some [375] basis points is no joke,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The labor market is hot, hot, hot, heaping pressure on the Fed to continue raising policy rates.”

Leisure and hospitality led the job gains, adding 88,000 positions.

Other sector gainers included health care (45,000), government (42,000) and other services, a category that includes personal and laundry services and which showed a total gain of 24,000. Social assistance saw a rise of 23,000, which the Labor Department said brings the sector back to where it was in February 2020 before the Covid pandemic.

Construction added 20,000 positions, while information was up 19,000 and manufacturing saw a gain of 14,000.

On the downside, retail establishments reported a loss of 30,000 positions heading into what is expected to be a busy holiday shopping season. Transportation and warehousing also saw a decline, down 15,000.

The numbers come as the Fed has raised rates half a dozen times this year, including four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases.

Despite the moves, job gains had been running strong this year if a bit lower than the rapid pace of 2021. On monthly basis, payrolls have been up an average of 392,000 against 562,000 for 2021. Demand for labor continues to outstrip supply, with about 1.7 positions open for every available worker.

“The Fed is tightening monetary policy but somebody forgot to tell the labor market,” said Fitch Ratings chief economist Brian Coulton. “The good thing about these numbers is that it shows the U.S. economy firmly got back to growth in the second half of the year. But job expansion continuing at this speed will do nothing to ease the labor supply-demand imbalance that is worrying the Fed.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell earlier this week said the job gains are “far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time” and said wage pressures are contributing to inflation.

“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation,” he said during a speech Wednesday in Washington, D.C.

Markets expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0.5 percentage point when it meets later this month. That’s likely to be followed by a few more increases in 2023 before the central bank can pause to see how its policy moves are impacting the economy, according to current market pricing and statements from several central bank officials.

Powell has stressed the importance of getting labor force participation back to its pre-pandemic level. However, the November reports showed that participation fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.1%, tied for the lowest level of the year as the labor force fell by 186,000 and is now slightly below the February 2020 level."
Dec 05 2013,"Obama shifts to economy, calls for minimum wage hike",Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/04/obama-shifts-to-economy-calls-for-minimum-wage-hike/,"President Obama, under fire for the rocky debut of his signature health care program, shifted gears Wednesday to focus on the economy and reiterate his call for an increase in the minimum wage.

“It will be good for our economy, it will be good for our families,” Obama said of a minimum wage hike. The White House is backing a bill that would raise the federal minimum to just over $10 an hour, up from $7.25.

Critics of a minimum wage increase argue that it could have the perverse effect of hurting the economy, resulting in higher costs for consumers and fewer jobs to offset the cost of higher wages.

But Obama touted local efforts to address the minimum wage. Around the same time as Obama’s speech, the D.C. Council voted to give preliminary approval to hike the minimum wage to $11.50 an hour, which would be one of the nation's highest.

The president called the growing income gap a ""defining challenge of our time.""

""The basic bargain at the heart of our economy has frayed,"" the president said in remarks at a nonprofit community center a short drive from the White House in one of Washington's most impoverished neighborhoods.

He was also in friendly territory, at an event sponsored by the Center for American Progress, a think tank with close ties to the White House. The president vowed to focus the last three years of his presidency on addressing the discrepancy and a rapidly growing deficit of opportunity that he said is a bigger threat than the fiscal deficit.

But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., argued that the president's message was undermined by his support for an immigration overhaul which he claimed would hurt workers.

“It is shocking for the President to give a speech about income disparity and falling wages while pushing an immigration plan that will hammer American workers and widen the disparity,"" he said in a statement.

Obama's remarks on the economy come as he seeks to move past the health care woes that have consumed his presidency in recent months. He acknowledged his administration's ""poor execution"" in rolling out the flawed website that was supposed to be an easy portal for purchasing insurance, while blaming Republicans for a ""reckless"" partial shutdown of the government.

""Nobody has acquitted themselves very well these past few months. So it's not surprising that the American people's frustrations with Washington are at an all-time high,"" Obama said. But he added that Americans' frustrations also run high to try to meet ends meet, no matter how hard they work.

The speech comes amid growing national and international attention to economic disparities -- from the writings of Pope Francis to the protests of fast-food workers in the U.S. The president cited the pope's question of how it isn't news when an elderly homeless person dies from exposure, but news when stock market loses two points.

Obama said increasing income inequality is more pronounced in the United States than other countries. He said Americans should be offended that a child born into poverty has such a hard time escaping it. ""It should compel us to action. We're a better country than this,"" the president said.

Obama did not propose any new policy initiatives in the speech.

Sep 26 2013,Why Bill O'Reilly Shouldn't Report On The Economy,Media Matters,left,http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/09/26/why-bill-oreilly-shouldnt-report-on-the-economy/196096,"Fox News' Bill O'Reilly unleashed a slew of deceptive and historically inaccurate economic arguments to prop up the narrative that “taxes in America have reached critical mass” under President Obama, whom O'Reilly claimed has redistributed the nation's wealth.

On the September 25 edition of The O'Reilly Factor, O'Reilly ranted about the United State's current tax rates, complaining, “The federal government is getting more tax revenue than ever before and state and local taxes are at the highest level in the history of this country.” O'Reilly argued that working Americans are being “punished” by today's tax rates that have “have reached critical mass,” adding that President Obama has succeeded in redistributing the nation's wealth from the top to the bottom:

O'REILLY: President Obama and his acolytes do not want Americans to accumulate wealth. They want to take private wealth away from those who have it and give it to those who don't have it. And they have succeeded in doing that with an assist from the Bush administration, which ran up colossal debt after 9/11. Taxes in America have reached critical mass.

Later, when O'Reilly's guest Dr. Jeanne Zaino, a political science professor at Iona College, highlighted historic levels of income inequality and government efforts to mitigate the problem, O'Reilly yelled over her: “Your basic thesis of income inequality is socialism. Don't you get that? The government cannot impose income equality on a private marketplace. It can't.”

O'Reilly misfired on several of his arguments. For starters, his focus on total raw tax revenue is deceptive. Total tax revenue rises as the size of the economy and the working population grows -- revenues are comparable only as they relate to the size of the economy, which corrects for this growth.

Under Obama, tax revenues as a share of the economy are historically low. During Obama's first term, the ratio of revenue to GDP averaged 15.4 percent, the lowest levels since 1950, according to data from the Tax Policy Center. For context, since 1950, federal revenue has averaged approximately 18 percent of GDP.

These numbers are unsurprising because federal tax rates have declined to “near historic lows” for middle-income Americans, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities determined:

O'Reilly's claim that Obama has “succeeded” in redistributing wealth is laughable given the recent economic milestone the U.S. reached -- in 2012, the nation's income inequality gap reached its greatest extent since before the Great Depression. According to the Associated Press, America's richest one percent saw their incomes rise by 20 percent last year, while the other 99 percent of the country saw their incomes rise only one percent.

University of California, Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez recently released research showing that the top one percent has captured 95 percent of the income gains made during the first three years of economic recovery following the recession.

Economist and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich addressed a similar argument to O'Reilly's for cutting taxes and found it lacking, debunking his cries of “socialism” in the process. As Reich explained, America's historic income inequality is hurting our economy, and tax cuts are not the solution:"

Washington CNN —

It’s been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy, causing markets to plunge, unemployment to spike, housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression.

On Monday, President Barack Obama touted his administration’s successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work.

Obama said government’s response “put a floor under the fall” and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again.

The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus, creation of seven million jobs, the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers, higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports.

“We’ve cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we’ve begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity,” Obama said.

Although Obama paints a rosy scenario, there are still key questions on the economy.

Larry Summers, a leading name to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, withdrew his name from consideration on Sunday, clearing the way for Janet Yellen, who serves as vice chairwoman at the Fed, to become the leading candidate.

Also, the White House announced last week that top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget.

There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government, raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills, and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit.

There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans.

It’s the economy, stupid

That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, and rang true for Obama’s first presidential campaign as well.

And the American public agrees. In poll after poll, fixing the economy is a stubborn No. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about.

A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41% of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now, with health care at 16% and the crisis in Syria at 15%.

Soon after taking office, Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill, led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it.

Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention.

‘Poor marks’

But since his first two years in office, some experts say, the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy.

Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record.

“I give him very poor marks. Five years later, the economy is still very far from recovering,” said Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9% instead of 7.3% if so many people hadn’t given up and dropped out of the work force.

And it shows in Obama’s approval ratings.

Through much of last year, he had a 30% approval rating on the economy. That number is up this year – to 43% – but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue.

A screeching halt

In 2010, many conservatives, led by the tea party movement, sought to stop the president’s agenda. They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans.

Then, those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do.

The president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010. Instead, he’s been jumping from one political crisis to the next. Fights over federal budget and spending levels locked Congress in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government.

The narrative didn’t always fall in Obama’s favor; nor did the policies that ensued. Republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction. The president jumped on the deficit-reduction bandwagon and made that a priority.

Through protracted political battles over the size of the government, forced spending cuts, which sliced up to 10% of most of the federal budget, went into effect. It wasn’t the president’s favorite idea, however, for how to revive the economy.

He still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills. So did his supporters, who grew frustrated with the president.

“We’re getting tired. … The unemployment is unconscionable. We don’t know what the (president’s) strategy is,” Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, said in 2012.

But in the frame of deficit reduction, Obama was able to obtain a few concessions. He won a series of tax increases, including an increase on the top tax earners: those making more than $400,000 per year.

And the needle moved.

The budget cuts, tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years, according to the White House.

The nation’s debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade, which economists hail as good for the economy.

The foreign affairs president

While the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda, overseas conflict has kept his plate full.

He expanded the war in Afghanistan and ended the war in Iraq. He kept his attention on the citizen-led revolts that swept the Arab world and expanded the use of drones.

Under his administration, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed and the U.S. joined a NATO campaign to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and Obama is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria’s civil war.

Although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time, world events have created challenges for Obama’s ability to implement his domestic agenda.

“When you look at issues like military strikes in Syria … it takes the full time and attention of the leaders,” Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said recently.

As the president decided to hold off on a military strike in Syria while Secretary of State John Kerry works with his counterpart in Russia to devise a plan to rid the regime of its chemical weapons, the president attempted to revitalize discussion of his domestic agenda.

“Even as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue … it is still important to recognize that we’ve got a lot more stuff to do here in this government,” Obama said during a meeting with his Cabinet on Thursday.

Economist Mark Zandi said that, all things considered, the president has been fairly successful on the domestic front.

“It has been a tough road, but I think he did a pretty good job,” said Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.

But economist Baker offered a more critical perspective, saying the president hasn’t shown a willingness to push an economic agenda.

“Let’s say Syria didn’t happen. What would he be doing right now? I am not sure he has some agenda that is being obstructed by events in the world,” he said.

Syria aside, much of the White House’s attention this fall will be spent on getting Americans to sign up for the health insurance exchanges, the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Open enrollment begins October 1, and the administration is expected to spend $8.7 million on a media blitz to promote the exchanges.

Super Bowl champs to promote Obamacare

Second term, second chance

After his re-election, the president hoped to reset his economic agenda. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he will work to “reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class.”

This summer, he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy.

In a series of speeches this year, he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery, including income inequality and employment disparities.

Americans’ real median household income fell from $63,000 to $55,600 between 2000 and 2011, and as of December, 9.1 million jobs were necessary to restore the job market to pre-recession levels, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

“Reversing these trends has to be Washington’s highest priority. It has to be Washington’s highest priority. It’s certainly my highest priority,” Obama said in Galesburg, Illinois, in July.

Job creation, affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals. Those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy, creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education.

But what has the president done since that July speech? Some say, not much.

“Nothing has happened on any front,” economist Zandi said.

White House press secretary Jay Carney pushed back, arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities.

“The president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class,” Carney said Wednesday.

As new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom, the president confronted the issue Monday.

“I can”t remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn’t get 100% of what it wants,” the president said, blaming the Republicans for potential “massive economic turmoil.”

With ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling, Zandi said immigration reform, which would be a major catalyst for economic growth, appears to be heading nowhere in the House. And tax and entitlement reform, which would also help to stimulate the economy, have no chance of happening this year.

There’s always next year. But 2014 is an election year, which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation. After that, the president is in his final two years of office, and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the Oval Office.

Then, by definition, it can be hard for a lame duck president to get much done."

Promising to address inequality and strengthen the middle class, President Obama’s State of the Union address combined sound and foolish proposals, laced with good, old-fashioned demagoguery.

Despite nearly five years of economic recovery, the fortunes of working Americans have decidedly worsened. The president’s policies should carry considerable culpability and bear correction.

Instead, he pronounced that upward mobility has stalled—when non-partisan economic studies show that’s not true—and insisted the wealthy should pay to balance the accounts.

[pullquote]

Thanks to the president’s free-trade policies, multinational corporations and talented Americans have earned huge income gains selling know how and services around the globe. Meanwhile, the stuff ordinary Americans make is increasingly shut out of the fastest-growing overseas markets.

GM boasts some of the best-selling cars in China, but high tariffs, regulations and an artificially cheap currency compel it to produce the vehicles there. The president refuses to effectively confront protectionism throughout Asia, denying Americans good-paying jobs.

ObamaCare is driving up health insurance costs. Along with higher taxes, that curbs domestic purchases, slows economic recovery and destroys jobs. Restrictions on offshore petroleum development, costly new banking and environmental regulations and a shortage of lending by regional banks make it tougher for small businesses to expand and add employees.

No surprise, some 20 million Americans can’t find full-time work, and the inflation-adjusted wages of ordinary workers are falling. Factoring in higher state and local taxes, most families are much worse off than five years ago, and record numbers of Americans depend on food stamps.

Now Obama wants to double down on failed initiatives. Instead of asking Congress to suspend the mandate that all Americans obtain excessive and expensive health insurance, he is launching an aggressive campaign to persuade young Americans to buy overpriced policies.

Presidential proposals to build a national network of manufacturing innovation centers, strengthen infrastructure, federal job training and R&D, and rapidly expand industrial use of clean natural gas have great merit. Yet, no matter how strong the products and productive their workers, America’s factories need more customers at home and abroad to succeed, grow and raise wages.

Unfortunately, the president proposes to push forward with new trade agreements in Asia that will further open U.S. markets to foreign competition without getting adequately enforceable concessions on discriminatory regulations and currency manipulation that keep out American products and impoverish once-proud U.S. blue-collar workers.

He wants Congress to approve a minimum wage of $10.10 an hour. That’s a 39 percent jump, and hardly justified by the 9 percent inflation since the federal floor was set in July 2009. Such an increase would compel McDonald’s to aggressively implement methods to cut employees. Smaller restaurants whose customers simply cannot afford to pay another $2 for lunch would close, and the same would in other industries.

Comprehensive immigration reform would help. Bringing undocumented workers out of the shadows would raise the wages they command, and those of citizens competing with them.

Republicans in Congress want a deal that really secures our borders from another surge of illegal immigrants. However, given the president’s poor record of sticking to his word in budget negotiations, critical members like Senator Marco Rubio are reluctant to trust him.

All this illustrates the central reason for Washington’s inaction on crucial issues.

The president dodges responsibility for the failures of his ideological agenda by asking Congress to tax the “one percent” for simply exploiting conditions he created.

Americans judge the president by their own deteriorating conditions, and his credibility on economic issues is falling precipitously.

Members of Congress simply don’t trust him to address problems as the facts require and keep his word when it counts."
Aug 15 2013,Poll: Obama approval on economy sinks to 35 percent,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/08/15/poll-obama-approval-on-economy-sinks-to-35-percent/,"President Obama's approval rating on the economy sunk to 35 percent in the latest Gallup poll, despite the president's renewed focus on the issue with a series of jobs-themed trips over the summer.

The Gallup poll released Thursday shows the president's overall approval rating also continuing to drop. In the Aug. 7-11 survey, Obama was given a 44 percent approval rating -- down from 47 percent in early June.

The president fared worst on economic issues.

On the economy, his rating is down 7 points from June. His rating on the issue of taxes also fell, from 41 percent to 36 percent.

On the budget deficit, despite modest improvements this year in deficit projections, the percentage of people who approve of Obama's handling went from 31 to 26.

The president does better -- with roughly half approving of his performance -- on the issues of terrorism, race relations and education.

Obama's not alone, though, in facing the public's disappointment. The poll shows Americans' approval of Congress is a meager 14 percent."

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Labor Department reported that the country added a meager 74,000 jobs in December — less than half what many analysts had expected. The unemployment rate dropped to 6.7 percent, but mostly because many people gave up looking for work, possibly deterred by a combination of cold weather, the holiday season and the expiration of long-term unemployment benefits. (To qualify for the benefit, an applicant must be trying to find a job.)

The weak numbers added fuel to the debate on Capitol Hill over whether to reinstate those federal benefits. Republicans argued that the data prove the program does little to help the unemployed find work. Democrats said the slowdown in hiring shows the labor market still needs support.

“It really tears your heart out,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in an interview Friday. “People are suffering, and we need to help them.”

December's numbers snap a four-month streak of robust hiring. Companies added more than 200,000 jobs a month, on average, from August through November amid political gridlock in Washington that led to the shutdown of the federal government.

Some economists argued that the December numbers, which will be revised several times, do not accurately reflect the underlying strength of the recovery. Other data show the economy has actually gained momentum, and many analysts have brightened their forecasts for 2014.

“It’s disappointing, not a disaster,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial. “It doesn’t change the picture yet. We need to see more than one month.”

But the large number of people who have been out of a job for six months or more continues to cast a shadow over the labor market. There were nearly 4 million long-term jobless Americans in December, virtually unchanged from the previous month. They account for more than one-third of the country’s unemployed workers — down from the post-recession peak but still higher than at any other time in the past 60 years.

More than a dozen long-term unemployed workers met with top Labor Department officials this week to express their frustration over the slow pace of the recovery. The workers were all age 50 or older and previously had held white-collar jobs. Some had earned six figures. They had been cut off from unemployment benefits and had exhausted their savings. One man teared up during the meeting, calling his job search more harrowing than his battle with cancer.

Johnetta Thurston, 57, of Odenton, Md., was laid off from her job as a human resources director in 2011. Since then, she has received several management certifications and enrolled in graduate school — but she still has not landed a permanent job.

“So you will hear the frustration,” she said at the meeting. But, she added, “I’m not going to go down without fighting.”

Some Democrats seized on Friday's numbers as a reason for approving their $18 million plan to extend benefits for workers who have hit the limit of their states' standard jobless benefits. The federal government had been providing several more weeks of emergency assistance, but that program lapsed Dec. 28. A key Senate vote over whether to restart those benefits is set for Monday.

“Today’s report shows why Republicans must join with Democrats to immediately extend emergency unemployment insurance for the 1.4 million Americans whose benefits were cut off in December,” Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement. “The economy is improving for some, but thousands of Americans in Nevada and across the country still cannot find work no matter how hard they try.”

The Democratic plan would extend the federal program until mid-November. It would also lower the benefits for the unemployed in the hardest-hit states from 47 to 31 weeks, on top of the usual 26 weeks that most states allow for jobless aid. Republicans are opposed to the proposal because they want to offset the cost of the unemployment benefits with other budget cuts. The program has been extended 13 times.

House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), whose leadership team has not signaled any support for Reid’s plan, said the focus should be on creating jobs.

“Instead of making it easier to find a good-paying job, Washington has been more focused on making it less difficult to live without one,” Boehner said in a statement.

In both parties, the sense of economic and political urgency for extending benefits had been losing momentum. The run of strong economic data during the fall had given policymakers more confidence that the recovery could be sustained.

Privately, some Democratic strategists view unemployment benefits as one of the only stimulus programs available to them in a time of divided government. They believe a jolt to the broader economy is critical to helping boost President Obama’s approval ratings.

Some Democrats have talked openly about the political gains for the party if Republicans, either in the Senate or in the House, block the extension of jobless aid.

“If they do, it’s going to hurt them in the election. They’re not smelling the coffee over there on the other side of the aisle,” Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the No. 3 Democratic leader in the chamber, told reporters Thursday. He later added: “They block things like unemployment insurance and minimum wage at their peril.”

The high rate of long-term unemployment is one of the reasons the Federal Reserve has been cautious in withdrawing its support for the recovery. The central bank has pumped trillions of dollars into the economy and cut short-term interest rates to zero in an effort to encourage spending by consumers and businesses — and, in turn, create more jobs.

The Fed started to scale back its stimulus by reducing the amount of bonds it purchases to $75 billion this month, down $10 billion. The move signaled that the central bank had become more confident that the recovery would be sustained, but the small size of the reduction suggested the Fed believed the labor market is far from fully healed.

Friday’s data lower the probability that the Fed will make another cut when its top officials meet in Washington at the end of the month. They have emphasized that the size and pace of reductions will depend on the health of the economy. If the recovery picks up momentum, the Fed could move faster; if the economy stumbles, it could slow down.

But Paul Dales, chief economist at Capital Economics, predicted that the Fed would likely continue winding down its stimulus program in the absence of additional data showing weakness in the labor market.

“If you’re going to tweak policy on the basis of every single payrolls number that comes in, you’re going to drive yourself and the markets crazy,” he said. “You don’t just throw all that careful planning out because of one dodgy payroll.”"

Say, haven't we heard that before?

Why, yes we have! As Andrew Kaczynski at Buzzfeed points out, he gave himself the same assessment in August 2010 and October 2011.

Hey, I'll let the August incomplete slide -- he'd only been in office for a year and a half, not quite enough time to see if his policies were sticking. That's fair. But now, at the end of his first term, since it's not better and he can't give himself an A without seeming totally out of touch, he just won't give himself anything at all. His efforts at ""recovery"" have prompted sluggish growth (or none at all, depending on whom you ask), and his unwillingness to entertain any ideas besides his own hardly speaks to his ability to unite the country, either (unless you count all of Congress uniting to unanimously reject his budget proposals two years running -- bipartisanship!).

Besides that, which of his pet projects are actually helping the economy? Solyndra? The artificial student loan interest rates that actually drive up the cost of college tuition? Bueller?

Feb 14 2013,Austerity Measures and Budget Cuts Would Not Hurt the Economy,The Heritage Foundation,right,http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/02/budget-cuts-would-not-harm-the-economy,"The Congressional Budget Office projects that the federal budget deficit will exceed three-quarters of $1 trillion in 2013. The U.S. economy continues to badly underperform, leaving millions of Americans out of work, depressing wage gains, and restricting opportunities. Despite a broad consensus favoring deficit reduction, some worry that reducing the budget deficit too rapidly might further weaken the recovery. These concerns are misplaced.

Steady, sustained deficit reduction would not hamper the recovery and may well provide modest near-term support for growth by whittling away at the debilitating uncertainty restraining growth. President Obama and Congress should work toward cutting spending in 2013 as part of a credible plan to balance the budget in 10 years in full confidence that the economy would benefit thereby.

Deficit Spending Does Not Spur Growth

As the economy slid into recession in 2008, first President Bush and then President Obama resorted to massive deficit spending to sustain and then stimulate the economy. It failed on a bipartisan basis.

It failed not because the spending surge and tax relief were poorly designed—and not because the resulting deficits were too small for the task—but because it could not work: The essential theory behind the stimulus was fundamentally flawed, a form of fiscal alchemy.

Basic Keynesian theory holds that the economy is underperforming because total demand is too low. Government spending contributes to total demand while taxes subtract from demand. Thus, the theory proceeds, by increasing government spending and reducing taxes fiscal policy can boost total demand and thus push the economy toward full employment. It is simple arithmetic, proponents argue.

Of course, were it truly so simple, there would be no reason to stop at deficits pushing the economy toward full employment; one could increase deficits sufficiently to attain full employment fairly quickly.

The theory fails because it relies on the unstated fantasy government can magically create demand out of thin air. In fact, government must borrow to finance deficits, and all borrowing subtracts from the funds that would otherwise be available and used in the private sector for private investment or private consumption. While budget deficits most certainly increase demand, the borrowing necessary to finance those deficits must dollar-for-dollar reduce demand. The net effect is more government debt but not more total demand and certainly not more jobs.

Those seeking to sustain the theory sometimes point to the possibility of importing more saving from abroad, thus avoiding the reduction in domestic private demand that must otherwise follow from the increase in government borrowing. To be sure, a net increase in imports of foreign saving likely financed some of the recent increase in budget deficits. However, it is also true the balance of payments must balance everywhere and always. As government borrowing rises and net inflows of foreign savings rise, so too must the net trade deficit—either U.S. exports must decline or U.S. imports must rise. In either event, once again total demand is unaffected though the composition of demand changes.[1]

After the Obama stimulus in 2009 failed to spur the economy, Congress and President Obama tried again with a payroll tax rate cut in 2010 intended to increase employment indirectly by increasing total demand and to increase the demand for workers directly by lowering employers’ costs. The policy failed on both counts.

The policy failed to spur employment indirectly for the reasons described above: While government net demand rose, government borrowing also rose, reducing private demand or increasing the trade deficit dollar-for-dollar. However, the payroll tax cut also failed to increase employment because policymakers ignored the reality of who pays the payroll tax. Employees, not employers, pay the tax, so cutting the payroll tax raised the return to work. This was fine for those working, but it left undisturbed employers’ costs. The net effect, then, ironically, was to increase the supply of workers in an environment of high unemployment.

Deficit Reduction Does Not Harm Growth

Just as deficit spending failed to spur the economy, cutting spending and reducing the budget deficit would generally not slow the economy in the near term. It may even provide a modest short-term lift while improving the economy’s performance in future years.

In the near term, reducing government spending means leaving more of the nation’s saving available for private use. In short, government’s contribution to demand falls while private demand rises. The added benefit to the economy comes from the reduction in uncertainty associated with slowing the growth in federal debt. As many now acknowledge, a main cause of the slow recovery in recent years is an oppressive uncertainty surrounding the effects of Washington policies.

Smaller deficits mean less uncertainty, which means a somewhat stronger economy in the near term. In the longer run, less deficit spending means more capital available for private investment to increase future productivity and future wages.

Shock and Awe vs. Steady and Consistent

Reducing government budget deficits generally means a stronger economy in the long run with little or no near-term ill-effects. The exception occurs when spending shifts quickly and in large amounts. The enormity of government spending means it plays a substantial role in the economy. Thus, rapid and unexpected reductions in spending can affect the economy like any other major shock, such as a rapid increase in the price of oil. Economic arrangements predicated on certain expectations about government spending are upended, rendering plans obsolete and inflicting losses on those affected.

This effect was apparent in the data on gross domestic product (GDP) for the fourth quarter of 2012. The preliminary data included a rapid drop in federal spending on national security. Apparently, and wisely, the Defense Department prepared for the substantial cuts to 2013 defense spending in case sequestration is allowed to take effect. These cuts threaten national security, and they cause enormous management problems for the Pentagon. They also mean a shock to the economy and so naturally there is a negative economic consequence.

However, the reduction in defense spending was not per se a cause of the reduction in overall GDP growth; the cause was the unexpected sharp reduction in spending, and this effect is fleeting because the economy will quickly adjust to the new level of spending.

Looking Across the Pond

Many nations across Europe are cutting spending and raising taxes while watching unemployment soar. Is this in store for the United States if the federal government aggressively cuts spending?

The answer is no. While the shock effect from spending reductions may be greater largely because European economies suffer from less flexible labor markets, Europe’s current economic malaise is only tangentially related to fiscal policy, and that through Europe’s proclivity for raising taxes on productive activity.[2]

The true sources of Europe’s current difficulties are regulatory and monetary, and so there are no lessons for a more austere U.S. fiscal policy to be drawn from Europe aside from the folly of raising taxes. On the contrary, like the U.S., many countries in Europe have increased their public debt to dangerous levels, and so while austerity poses at most a minor shock-effect problem for economic growth today, failure to rein in deficits and debt would pose an enormous threat to Europe’s economy once today’s issues are resolved.

Diminish Uncertainty: Follow the Path to Balance

Projected federal budget deficits pose a dire threat to America’s future. President Obama and Congress should settle on a firm path to balancing the federal budget within the next 10 years and then get to work reforming federal programs and cutting spending in 2013 to follow that path. Doing so would have a modest, positive effect on the economy in the near term as another Washington-sourced uncertainty hanging over the economy diminishes, while a stronger foundation is built for America’s future growth.

Speaker of the House John Boehner has recently touted a list of 88 economists who warn against the expiration of tax cuts on high-income earners . These economists came together from some of the country's top universities, think-tanks and business organizations to write that the expiration of the tax cuts pushed by President Obama ""will hurt the economy and must be stopped before it goes into effect.""

Speaker Boehner also touted a study from Ernst and Young conducted for the National Federation of Independent Businesses that found that allowing tax rates to go up on high-income Americans could destroy up to 700,000 jobs.

The Ernst & Young study also predicted that economic output would be reduced by $200 billion next year, investment would fall and would lead to a 1.8% reduction in American wages.

Democrats used to promote temporary tax cuts distributed across a wide range of income levels as ""stimulus"" that could aid an ailing economy. As the fight over these tax increases have proven, that's only when they're not fighting class warfare against ""the rich.""

Back in 2010, the CBO estimated that extending all the tax cuts would prove a lot more helpful to the economy than passing cuts for everyone but the top rates. Depending on their model, in the short term, the top rate cuts would give the economy a 30-50% boost over what would have been estimated otherwise.

Furthermore, as CBO director Doug Elmendorf's chart reveals, passing permanent tax cuts would be even more helpful to the economy in the short-term - though it's important to point out that in the medium and long term, the effects of increased government debt would become a significant drag on the economy.

If the rationale for extending these tax cuts is to boost economic output in the short-term, it makes little to no sense to exempt rate increases for upper-income Americans.

But the Democrats have never been ones to adhere to common sense."
Jun 07 2012,Bernanke: Fed could act if US economy weakens,Fox News (Online News),right,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/06/07/bernanke-likely-to-be-pressed-on-health-economy-2127465058/,"Slumping job growth has alarmed some economists who fear the U.S. economy is in trouble.

Ben Bernanke doesn't appear to be one of them.

The Federal Reserve chief sketched a hopeful outlook in testimony to a congressional panel Thursday and sent no signals that the Fed will take further steps soon to aid the economy.

Bernanke acknowledged that Europe's debt crisis poses risks to the U.S. financial markets. He also noted that U.S. unemployment remains high at 8.2 percent. And he said the Fed is prepared to take steps to boost the U.S. economy if it weakens.

But he said Fed officials still need to study the most recent economic trends, including job growth. For now, Bernanke said he foresees moderate growth this year.

He said he's mindful that all that could change, if Europe's crisis quickly worsened or U.S. job growth stalled.

""As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate,"" he told the Joint Economic Committee.

The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, which might encourage more borrowing and spending. Or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014 until an even later date.

But most economists don't expect a major announcement at the Fed's next policy meeting June 19-20, despite signals this week from some other Fed members in favor of considering further action.

For one thing, long-term U.S. interest rates have already touched record lows. Even if rates dropped further, analysts say they might provide little benefit for the economy. They say it's unlikely that many businesses and consumers who aren't borrowing now at super-low rates would do so if rates declined a bit more.

And Bernanke could face pressure not to pursue further stimulus before the November election because such steps could be perceived as helping President Barack Obama win re-election.

""The Fed stimulative effects have really run their course,"" Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, argued in a television interview last week.

John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said there was nothing in the testimony to ""tip Bernanke's hand"" before the June meeting of the Fed's policy committee.

""Yes, the Fed chairman said the Fed stands ready to act if Europe poses a threat to the U.S. financial system or the economy,"" they wrote in a note to clients. ""However, he gave no specifics.""

Many analysts are worried that the U.S. economy is suffering a midyear slump just as in 2010 and 2011. They're concerned in particular about the job market. From December through February, the economy added an average 252,000 jobs a month. But since then, job growth has slowed to a lackluster 96,000 a month. In May, U.S. employers added just 69,000 jobs -- the fewest in a year.

Bernanke said the Fed is still assessing the most recent employment data. Like many economists, Bernanke suggested that a warm winter might have prompted some hiring that normally would have occurred later. That could have weakened hiring temporarily in the spring. If that's true, hiring might bounce back.

Still, Bernanke said some of the winter hiring might have made up for excessive job cuts during the recession. If so, and if those companies have completed such ""catch-up"" hiring, then stronger economic growth might be needed to boost hiring, Bernanke said.

""That is the essential question we will have to look at,"" he told the panel.

The government said last week that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first three months of 2012.

Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said he thought Bernanke didn't seem alarmed by the weak hiring in May.

""His view is that it isn't a sign that the economy is falling apart,"" Edelstein said.

Bernanke's message to financial markets, Edelstein said, was, ""Don't expect anything drastic from the Fed at the June meeting.""

That said, if the Fed does announce some new action at its meeting later this month, Edelstein said the most likely step would be to extend a program, known as Operation Twist, that will expire at the end of June.

Under Operation Twist, the Fed sells shorter-term securities and buys longer-term bonds. As with other Fed bond purchases, the idea has been to drive down long-term rates so that mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business loans become more attractive.

The Fed's policy committee has been split between those who favor doing everything possible to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment, and those more concerned about inflation risks.

On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the vice chairman of the Fed, Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta regional Fed Bank, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed bank, all suggested that the Fed might need to do more to provide support.

But Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, warned at Thursday's hearing against more bond buying. He and other critics worry that ever-lower borrowing rates could eventually ignite inflation.

""It is my belief that the Fed has done all that it can do and has perhaps done too much,"" said Brady, vice chairman of the committee."

In recent months, economic growth in China has not only slowed — it's slowed faster than most people expected. Last week, for the first time since the depths of the global financial crisis, the government actually cut lending rates to try to spur growth. All of this has people wondering: Where is the world's star economy headed?

The sound bites from last week's news were dreary: ""There's something of a cloud hanging over China's previously booming economy."" ... ""One adviser to China's leadership calls it a sharp slowdown."" ... ""Simply put, the world's second-largest economy is running out of steam.""

And they followed some concerning figures. In May, consumer prices fell well below government targets. This week, the head of a Chinese government think tank said growth from April through June could drop below 7 percent.

Weakening Business Confidence

Weakness has been showing up in various corners of the economy, including air travel.

Brian Pearce, the chief economist at the International Air Transport Association, says air travel in China has been hit pretty hard.

""For a number of years, we were seeing growth rates of 15, 20 percent,"" he said in Beijing, where he was attending the association's annual conference. ""That seems to have slowed down quite sharply over the last year, and we're seeing growth rates down to single figures, which is quite strong for most markets, but for China, that's a pretty weak outcome.""

Most travel in China is for business, and many business people are anxious.

""Confidence has been weaker, particularly among smaller business. Also, export business has weakened,"" Pearce says. ""China has seen exports to Europe fall quite sharply because of the problems in Europe.""

The government tightened up a little too much in two areas: in the housing market and on construction of public infrastructure.

Government-Promised Slowdown

When people talk about China's economy, they often focus on exports. But most of the things driving the current decline are homegrown.

Andy Rothman, China macro-strategist for CLSA, an independent brokerage and investment group, says the slowdown promised by the Communist Party is under way.

Rothman says China's blistering growth is no longer sustainable. The government has been trying to slow it down and improve its quality. The problem, he says, is that the Communist Party overdid it.

""The government tightened up a little too much in two areas: in the housing market and on construction of public infrastructure,"" he says.

The government put restrictions on real estate sales to bring down sky-high prices. But driving down sales also helped drive down demand for things such as steel and concrete — hurting factories.

The government is now quietly encouraging some home buying and approving new public projects to help stabilize the economy. Last month, home sales picked up in major cities.

Rothman is generally upbeat.

If the government doesn't do anything to reform the current system, China's economy will be stuck in this structural downshift for quite some time. For many, many years.

""We've got kind of a typical situation in China, where things don't work perfectly well but then the government comes in and fixes it pretty quickly,"" he says. ""And now I think we're back on track to get just over 8 percent growth this year, which is what we expected at the start of the year.""

Long-Term Outlook

In the short term, Ren Xianfeng, a senior analyst with IHS Global Insight in Beijing, is upbeat too.

""If you ask me to look at the next six months, I'm optimistic, because everyone is in panic mode now,"" she says.

But she's more pessimistic about the medium and longer term. That's because China's economy needs serious reform, Ren says.

To keep growth going, the government needs to build a more innovative economy, one that doesn't favor state-owned companies so much and does more to help finance private firms, which create most of the jobs in China anyway.

""If the government doesn't do anything to reform the current system, China's economy will be stuck in this structural downshift for quite some time,"" she says. ""For many, many years.""

After decades of spectacular growth, that would be a shock — and something no one wants to see."
Mar 01 2022,Russia’s richest have lost $83B this year as Ukraine war sanctions slam economy,New York Post (News),right,https://nypost.com/2022/03/01/russias-richest-have-lost-83b-this-year-amid-war-sanctions/,"Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is taking a worsening toll on the wealth of the country’s richest oligarchs as international sanctions crush the Russian economy.

Russian billionaires have lost a combined $83 billion in on-paper wealth this year – with most of the losses occurring in the days since the Kremlin ordered military against Ukraine. Their losses have more than doubled since the invasion began last week.

The Russian ruble tanked to record lows this week in response to the sanctions, which include the ejection of some Russian banks from the SWIFT international banking system. Several Russian business elites also faced individual restrictions from the US and other countries due to their close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

So far, Vagit Alekperov, the billionaire chairman of Russian energy giant Lukoil, has paid the steepest price. Alekperov has lost more than $13 billion so far this year – more than any other Russian businessman on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Vladimir Potanin, who currently ranks as Russia’s richest individual, has lost more than $6 billion off his net worth this year. A close associate of Putin, Potanin is president and chairman of Russia’s Norilsk Nickel

Gennady Timchenko, one of the Russian billionaires who faces individual sanctions, has lost $10.6 billion this year, or nearly half of his overall on-paper wealth, according to Bloomberg.

The financial losses among Russia’s richest could increase pressure on Putin, who has faced an international backlash for ordering the attack. Meanwhile, Russia’s military has bogged down in its bid to capture Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv.

So far, at least three Russian billionaires — Oleg Deripaska, Mikhail Fridman and Roman Abramovich – have publicly called for an end to the war. Both are under sanction.

Deripaska wrote on Telegram that peace talks should begin “as fast as possible.”

Roman Abramovich gave up “stewardship and care” of Premier League soccer team Chelsea during the international crisis. A spokesperson for the Russian billionaire – who has lost more than $4 billion this year – said he is attempting to broker peace between Russia and Ukraine.

“I can confirm Roman Abramovich was contacted by the Ukrainian side for support in achieving a peaceful resolution, and that he has been trying to help ever since,” the spokesperson told ESPN."
Jan 17 2019,OPINION: Trump's shutdown nightmare: A choice between the economy and the wall,Guest Writer - Left,left,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/politics/donald-trump-shutdown-nancy-pelosi-economy/index.html,"CNN —

If the government shutdown lasts much longer, President Donald Trump’s only way out may involve a choice between two pillars of his political viability – his border wall and his purring economy.

More and more Americans are feeling the effects of the partial shutdown every day, from travelers stuck in security lines to Coast Guard officers now joining the hundreds of thousands of federal employees going without pay.

Yet the normal political pressure points that usually end shutdown standoffs are not working, perhaps because of the unique dynamics of the Trump era. As a result, there’s every chance that the stalemate now in its 27th day could drag on much longer.

Trump told supporters on Tuesday, for example, “We’re going to stay out for a long time if we have to.”

Sen. John Kennedy, who flew on Air Force One with the President on Monday, said Trump is adamant that he’s not budging.

“He is a carnivore – and on this one he believes he is right,” the Louisiana Republican said.

In another sign the impasse could be extended, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi asked the President to move the day of the State of the Union address – now set for January 29 – or deliver it in writing because of overstretched security agencies. A White House official familiar with preparations told CNN’s Jim Acosta Wednesday night that, “at this point,” Trump still plans to deliver the speech as scheduled on January 29.

Shutdowns usually end when either side, the President or Congress, begins to feel unbearable pressure and the cost of going on outweighs the political damage sustained by a climbdown.

Since that pivot point is not yet at hand, longer-term factors may come into play. One significant pressure point could be the side effects of the shutdown on economic growth, unemployment and consumer confidence.

If the standoff over the President’s demand that Democrats provide $5.7 billion in wall funding is prolonged, the chances of genuine damage to the economy – one of the unarguable hot spots of Trump’s presidency – rise significantly.

Kevin Hassett, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, has warned that the impact of the shutdown on government contractors is higher than expected and could significantly shave growth figures.

“We subsequently, right now, think that it’s about a tenth of a percent a week, not a tenth of a percent every two weeks,” Hassett told reporters on Tuesday.

His comment was intended to pile pressure on Democrats on Capitol Hill to give in to Trump’s demands. But it also served to underline the risk to the President, who arguably has more at stake over the economy than Democrats.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday called the shutdown a “self-inflicted wound” and “negative” for the economy.

Trump rarely misses a chance to celebrate historically low unemployment numbers and strong growth figures. Good economic indicators will be crucial to his hopes of re-election and could blunt Democratic attacks next year as he seeks to retain Midwestern industrial states that paved his way to the White House.

So if the economic damage from the shutdown starts to add up, it could begin to weigh much more heavily on Trump’s political calculations.

Economy is ‘incredibly strong’

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders tried Wednesday to squash a growing narrative that the shutdown could put a dent in the Trump economy.

“We are focused on the long-term economic goals of the administration,” Sanders said. “We have an incredibly strong economy, thanks to the President. We look forward to reopening the government, continuing to build on what we’ve done the last two years.”

An economic headache could prove to be one way Trump begins to feel political heat over the shutdown, especially if it starts to reverberate in the stock markets, which have steadied after a volatile period at the turn of the year.

But if the economy tempts him to cave, it will be a difficult choice, since the shutdown may be the last best chance to get funding for the wall during his term. While he could vow to continue the fight for the border wall in his re-election race, his promises could be devalued if he is defeated by Democrats this time around.

So far, the President has not seemed to be moved by the traditional leverage points that occur during shutdowns.

He’s not showed much sympathy for government workers forced to go without pay, even suggesting that they want him to stand firm and get his wall.

And since he’s not made much effort to broaden his political coalition in office, he has few middle-of-the-road voters to lose from digging into a showdown that pleases his base.

Democratic leaders are trying to change the equation. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday invoked the plight of a government worker who missed a paycheck last week and is uncertain he can afford medicines.

“I want President Trump to look into these faces and see what he is doing by using these men and women as pawns, using them in an extortion game,” the New York Democrat said.

“Mr. President, President Trump, look at the pain and suffering you’re causing,” Schumer said.

But Trump has so far proven impervious to such appeals. A President who has always had a strong connection with the people who sent him to the White House is calculating he still has some breathing room.

Polling polarization over the wall

New polling on Wednesday showed the price the President could pay if if he were to cave in on the wall, a fundamental campaign promise that is one of the keys to his bond with grass-roots supporters.

A Pew Research poll found that 79% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents see the shutdown as a “very serious” problem for the country, but just 35% of Republicans and Republican leaners feel the same way.

And emphasizing why neither party thinks it’s in a political position that could prompt a compromise, 82% of Republicans and Republican leaners back a substantial expansion of the border wall. Only 6% of Democrats agree.

Democrats are indeed in a strong political position. Pelosi is at the apex of her power as speaker just months after the Democratic midterm election triumph. She has also been able to deflect Trump’s blame over the stalemate by passing bills to open individual agencies – that have gone nowhere in the Senate.

In a letter to the President on Wednesday she pulled off a true power play, saying that owing to security concerns amid the shutdown, he should reconsider the date for his State of the Union address.

Since the chance to address a joint session of Congress in an annual television ritual is the kind of high-profile event Trump loves, Pelosi gave the President little choice.

In effect, Pelosi was sending Trump a reminder of her power, and a message that if he wants to get his live State of the Union address, he will have to drop his demands and reopen the government.

Trump tried his own power move, inviting a group of moderate Democrats to the White House as part of a bipartisan group of moderates, seeking to peel them away from Pelosi.

But one of the lawmakers, Rep Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, told CNN’s Manu Raju that he stressed the core Democratic position to the President.

“It’s very hard to actually find an agreement on a way forward on these other issues that are pressing without actually reopening the government,” Gottheimer said.

His comments were a fresh sign that the internal political forces in Washington that could break open the stalemate are not yet in place, meaning it could take a significant nudge from outside – perhaps a slowing economy – to break the deadlock."
Feb 13 2013,Obama Pledges Push to Lift Economy for Middle Class,New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/us/politics/obama-delivers-state-of-the-union-address.html?ref=politics&_r=0,"WASHINGTON — President Obama, seeking to put the prosperity and promise of the middle class at the heart of his second-term agenda, called on Congress on Tuesday night to raise the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour, saying that would lift millions out of poverty and energize the economy.

In an assertive State of the Union address that fleshed out the populist themes of his inauguration speech, Mr. Obama declared it was “our generation’s task” to “reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth — a rising, thriving middle class.”

“Every day,” he said, “we should ask ourselves three questions as a nation: How do we attract more jobs to our shores? How do we equip our people with the skills to get those jobs? And how do we make sure that hard work leads to a decent living?”

The increase in the minimum wage, from $7.25 an hour now, was the most tangible of a raft of initiatives laid out by the president, from education and energy to public works projects. Taken together, Mr. Obama said, these investments would accelerate the nation’s recovery by helping those in the broad middle class."

The U.S. economy has been growing for four straight years — each under the leadership of President Obama.

But the pace of improvement has been disappointing to many, especially the nearly 12 million people still looking for work.

Americans are divided about how to view the White House's economic record. A McClatchy-Marist poll released this week shows 54 percent of Americans think the country is still in an economic downturn. But that dreary assessment is actually a big improvement considering that as recently as March, 63 percent thought the country was in a recession.

Now Obama is launching an effort to renew focus on job creation for the middle class. The White House says he will make about a half-dozen speeches around the country, with the first Wednesday afternoon at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill.

That's where he made a pivotal speech on the economy in 2005 — his first year as a U.S. senator. And on Monday, Obama told supporters that upon this return to Knox, he will deliver ""a pretty good speech.""

So as the White House gets ready for this new campaign to begin, let's take stock of five key indicators of economic health:

Jobs: Most economists say that nothing matters more than job growth. More jobs can quickly translate into more people buying cars, moving into new homes, taking vacations and otherwise stimulating growth.

But job creation has been slow throughout the recovery, with the unemployment rate staying stuck at 7.6 percent. This spring, the hiring pace picked up, to around 200,000 new jobs per month. In more normal times, that rate would give a president bragging rights, but at a time when 11.8 million remain out of work and another 8.3 million are stuck in part-time jobs, the economy is not adding enough paychecks.

Housing: After a tough — no, make that hideous — run of foreclosures and price plunges, the housing market finally is improving. The sector peaked in 2006, and then went into a nose dive that pushed prices down by roughly a third.

But the widely followed S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show average home prices have popped back up by roughly 12 percent over the past year. And mortgage defaults have been easing. So the market appears to be healing, though many homeowners are still a long way from seeing their real estate values return to 2006 levels.

Debt/deficit: The long-term national debt hovers at $16.75 trillion, roughly the same size as the entire U.S. economy. But thanks to this year's federal spending cuts and tax hikes, the annual budget deficit is shrinking fast.

The Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal 2013 deficit probably will decline to just 4 percent of GDP, down dramatically from 7 percent in 2012. By 2015, the deficit should be down to about 2 percent of GDP — a level that most economists would say is quite manageable. In light of such improvement, Moody's this month upgraded the U.S. credit rating outlook from negative to stable.

Interest rates: Whether they're buying a car or a home, most Americans are very concerned about interest rates. Over the past three months, mortgage rates have been heading higher, up from roughly 3.5 percent in early May to about 4.5 percent now for a 30-year-fixed mortgage. That remains a very low level by historical standards, and the upward trend has petered out, at least for now.

Economists generally say rates are still low enough to make cars and homes affordable for people with jobs. And for businesses, the prime lending rate is holding steady at 3.25 percent — a rate that makes it easy to borrow money for expansion.

Consumer sentiment: In general, consumer confidence has been rising over the past year, thanks to gains in jobs, stock prices and home values. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index showed the highest reading in May and June of any time since before the recession began in late 2007.

But a preliminary reading of the index for July suggests some of the spring's optimism has started to melt this summer as mortgage rates have ticked up. Sentiment also has declined as more workers have felt the effects of government spending cuts. In June, retail sales grew just 0.4 percent, a disappointing rate."
Jul 23 2013,Obama Seeking to Take Credit and Set Course for Economy,New York Times (News),left,http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/us/politics/for-obama-another-round-with-the-economy.html?ref=politics&_r=0,"WASHINGTON — President Obama is restarting a major effort this week to focus public attention on the American economy, a strategy aimed at giving him credit for the improving job market and lifting his rhetoric beyond the Beltway squabbles that have often consumed his presidency.

The new effort, which begins with a major address on Wednesday followed by as many as six economic-themed speeches over the next two months, reflects how often world events, his political adversaries and his own competing agenda have conspired to knock him off that subject. Republicans were already mocking Mr. Obama on Monday, noting that his speeches were among many campaign-style efforts over the last five years to jump-start an economic conversation with Americans.

The United States economy has grown steadily but slowly for more than four years, with home prices, stocks and retail sales rebounding from their lows in 2009. The economic growth has not resulted in large job gains, but there has been a turnaround in longstanding pessimism among Americans about their financial futures. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in early June found Americans increasingly positive in their views of the nation’s economy. Nearly 4 in 10 in the poll said the condition of the economy was very good or fairly good, the most in Mr. Obama’s presidency.

“We have come a long way since the depths of the Great Recession,” Jay Carney, the president’s spokesman, said Monday."
Dec 27 2012,What happens to the economy if we go over the cliff?,CNN (Online News),left,http://money.cnn.com/2012/12/27/news/economy/fiscal-cliff-economy/index.html?hpt=po_c1,"Five days left: It's looking more and more like Washington may not get a deal done in time to avert the fiscal cliff.

What happens to the economy if lawmakers don't cut a deal and the tax hikes and spending cuts become law?

The worst-case scenario is if Congress stands by and lets the fiscal cliff stay in effect all next year. Economists expect the U.S. economy would then fall into a recession.

Specifically, the Congressional Budget Office forecasts a drop of 0.5% in real gross domestic product and a 9.1% unemployment rate by the end of next year.

Related: What if there's no fiscal cliff deal

The good news is that no one expects Congress to let all fiscal cliff measures have their way with the economy for an extended period.

But there could still be an economic hit if lawmakers push the country over the fiscal cliff temporarily and then pass a fallback bill -- one that mostly just averts some of the tax increases.

For example, a bill passed in early January that does not address the scheduled automatic spending cuts or raise the country's debt ceiling.

In that case, economic growth could be dragged down somewhat in the first half of next year, according to estimates by economists at Goldman Sachs.

And that would come on top of a drag on growth that Goldman Sachs already expects from three things it believes are likely to happen: the expiration of the payroll tax cut, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts on the highest-income households, and the start of the new Medicare surtax on high income earners.

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The November jobs report, released Friday morning, was a pleasant surprise to analysts who had braced for some ugly numbers for a period during which much of the Northeast was reeling from the superstorm. In fact, the national unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent, and the nation added 146,000 jobs, not the mere 85,000 that forecasters had expected.

But the report contained some ominous elements as well. The jobless rate dropped in large part because the labor force fell by 350,000, suggesting that people gave up looking for work. The number of people saying they had a job actually fell by 122,000. And the Labor Department revised downward its estimates of job creation in September and October by a combined 49,000 jobs.

Add it all up, and the conclusion is this: The trend that we thought was underway, of a U.S. economy growing steadily but at an unspectacular pace, remains underway. It was not undone either by the hurricane or by anxiety over looming austerity — the tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 if Congress and the White House can’t reach a deal.

Indeed, the job market has been remarkably consistent over the past year, adding an average of 157,000 jobs a month — well above the level needed to keep pace with a growing labor force but slow enough that it would still take years to bring unemployment down to the range of 5 to 6 percent. The new report shows no real shift in that trend, which in its way is still good news: It suggests that businesses did not bring their hiring to a halt in November out of fear that lawmakers will be unable to reach a deal and the nation will hit the fiscal cliff.

The November report is the first snapshot of the job market released since President Obama was re-elected Nov. 6 and the first since negotiations over deficit reduction between the White House and House Republicans have resumed and intensified.

Responding to the report Friday morning, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) referred to those negotiations and focused on the people who are out of work rather than on the drop in the jobless rate.

“The Democrats’ slow-walk strategy is unfair to taxpayers, unfair to small businesses, and unfair to all those looking for work,” Boehner said in a statement. “If the president doesn’t like our plan, he has an obligation to send us one that can pass both houses of Congress as quickly as possible. We’re ready and eager to work with him on such a proposal.”

Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement that “while more work remains to be done, today’s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to heal from the wounds inflicted by the worst downturn since the Great Depression.”

Forecasters had expected a significant impact from Sandy, which struck at the tail end of October and disrupted commerce in large parts of New Jersey, New York and surrounding states. The level of new claims for unemployment benefits spiked from about 370,000 before the storm to 451,000 in the first week of November.

But the Labor Department said that “survey response rates in the affected states were within normal ranges” and that “our analysis suggests that Hurricane Sandy did not substantively impact the national employment and unemployment estimates for November.” More detailed data will be available Dec. 21, when state jobs numbers will be released, allowing a closer look at any employment changes in the affected states.

The biggest category for job gains was the retail sector, which added 53,000 positions. But that growth could be due to Thanksgiving falling relatively early on the calendar this year, meaning retailers likely added temporary seasonal workers earlier than they normally would.

Other major sectors that saw job gains were professional and business services, which added 43,000 jobs, and leisure and hospitality, with 23,000.

The biggest category for job losses was construction, which shed 20,000 positions, though that may well be a Sandy effect, as construction sites temporarily shut down in the Northeast. If that’s the case, that sector will be expected to rebound in the months ahead, as those construction workers get back on the job and rebuilding efforts bring in more work."

Evangelicals want action on immigration

VERBATIM: According to a new survey by LifeWay Research, the surge in illegal border crossings during the Biden administration is worrying Evangelical Christians. 80% want Congress to take action to stop the flow. Lifeway spokesman Scott McConnell says “The urgency continues to grow for Congress to act this year to improve laws around immigration.” The poll also finds that Evangelicals are concerned for the welfare of illegal aliens and want to share the gospel with them.

May 17 2013,Obama tries to talk economy amid din of scandal,Washington Times,right,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/may/17/obama-tries-talk-economy-amid-din-scandal/,"While much of Washington was riveted Friday on a Republican-led congressional hearing into abuse of power by the IRS, President Obama traveled to Baltimore to promote a jobs plan and decry lawmakers for “chasing every fleeting issue.”

Mr. Obama toured Ellicott Dredges, a firm that manufactures dredging equipment, and praised Democratic lawmakers from Maryland for focusing on programs to help the middle class. The president didn’t specifically address the IRS and other scandals confronting his administration, but he complained that Washington is too often distracted by partisan games.

“I know it can seem frustrating sometimes when it seems like Washington’s priorities aren’t the same as your priorities,” he told plant workers. “I know it often seems like folks down there are more concerned with their jobs than with yours. Others may get distracted by chasing every fleeting issue that passes by. But the middle class will always be my No.1 folks, period.”

The trip was the second installment of Mr. Obama’s “middle-class jobs and opportunity tour,” an effort to promote his economic agenda. But the president is having difficulty moving forward with his initiatives as his administration grapples with controversies ranging from the IRS to an investigation into last year’s terrorist attack on a diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, to a Justice Department leak probe targeting the news media.

The president said the country can’t afford distractions and said Americans deserve leaders who demonstrate “seriousness of purpose.”

“The only thing that’s holding us back sometimes is a lack of political will,” he said. “Sometimes our leadership isn’t focused where we need to be focused.”

Mr. Obama advocated $50 billion of infrastructure improvements but said “we’ve had a little difficulty getting our Republican friends to work with us” to approve the new spending. He announced that he is ordering the federal government to cut red tape to speed up construction projects.

“We’ve got to up our game when it comes to infrastructure,” Mr. Obama said.

But Republicans said Mr. Obama should listen to Peter Bowe, president of Ellicott Dredges, who testified to Congress Thursday in favor of building the Keystone XL pipeline to create more jobs. The administration has delayed approval for the northern portion of the pipeline, from Canada to Oklahoma, due to environmental concerns.

Mr. Bowe told lawmakers, “For us, it’s all about jobs, not construction jobs for the pipeline itself, but ongoing jobs every year for decades to come, all related to the production of oil from the Alberta oil sands deposits.”

The president didn’t mention the pipeline. But he said of the dredging company, the oldest of its kind in the U.S., “You all know a thing or two about growing the economy.”

Rep. Andy Harris, Maryland Republican, said Mr. Obama “has been dragging his feet for years” on the pipeline project that could provide more jobs to the company he visited.

“Unfortunately, this visit is just another one of President Obama’s campaign-style photo ops. Instead of doing concrete work to create jobs, he’s busy giving speeches and taking pictures,” Mr. Harris said.
